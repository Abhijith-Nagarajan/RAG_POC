{"title": "[Immune regulatory effect of citalopram on microglial cells].", "abstract": "To investigate the effects of antidepressant citalopram on the gene expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), and to discuss the impacts of citalopram on p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family in microglial cells. BV2 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. After pretreatment with citalopram (20 \u03bcmol/L) for 4 h, the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); after pretreatment for 24 h, the protein levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were analyzed by ELISA; the effects of citalopram on the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and JNK were observed after pretreatment for 30 min. Citalopram significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and JNK. Citalopram may play the anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting MAPK pathway in microglial cells.", "year": "2013"}
