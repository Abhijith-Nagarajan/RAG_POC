{"title": "Osteoprotegerin: multiple partners for multiple functions.", "abstract": "Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an essential secreted protein in bone turnover due to its role as a decoy receptor for the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kB ligand (RANKL) in the osteoclasts, thus inhibiting their differentiation. However, there are additional ligands of OPG that confer various biological functions. OPG can promote cell survival, cell proliferation and facilitates migration by binding TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans. A large number of in vitro, pre-clinical and clinical studies provide evidences of OPG involvement in vascular, bone, immune and tumor biology. This review describes an overview of the different OPG ligands regulating its biological functions.", "year": "2013"}
