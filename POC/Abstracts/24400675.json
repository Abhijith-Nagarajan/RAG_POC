{"title": "Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in a murine model of urinary tract infection with Candida albicans.", "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common clinical problem in diabetic patients; however, the relationship between UTI and glucosuria remains uncertain. To investigate the relationship, we examined the effect of glucosuria induced by sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the progression of UTI in mice. From 1\u2009day before transurethral inoculation with Candida albicans, female mice were treated orally once a day with an SGLT2 inhibitor in different treatment regimens: (i) dapagliflozin at 10\u2009mg/kg for 2, 3 or 7\u2009days, (ii) dapagliflozin at 0.1, 1 or 10\u2009mg/kg for 3\u2009days and (iii) dapagliflozin, canagliflozin or tofogliflozin at 10\u2009mg/kg for 3\u2009days. To evaluate the ascending UTI, the kidneys were removed 6\u2009days after the inoculation, and the number of viable C. albicans cells in kidney was measured as colony-forming units (CFU). In mice treated with dapagliflozin, the number of C. albicans CFU in kidney increased in accordance with both treatment duration and dose. The number of CFU significantly increased when mice were treated with 10\u2009mg/kg dapagliflozin or canagliflozin but not tofogliflozin. With dapagliflozin and canagliflozin, urine glucose concentration (UGC) significantly increased up to 24\u2009h after drug administration; with tofogliflozin, UGC significantly increased only up to 12\u2009h after drug administration. Our data indicate that increased susceptibility to UTI is associated with a persistent increase in UGC.", "year": "2014"}
