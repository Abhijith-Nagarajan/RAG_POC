{"title": "Peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery: a rich source of drug targets.", "abstract": "The range of antibiotic therapy for the control of bacterial infections is becoming increasingly limited because of the rapid rise in multidrug resistance in clinical bacterial isolates. A few diseases, such as tuberculosis, which were once thought to be under control, have re-emerged as serious health threats. These problems have resulted in intensified research to look for new inhibitors for bacterial pathogens. Of late, the peptidoglycan (PG) layer, the most important component of the bacterial cell wall has been the subject of drug targeting because, first, it is essential for the survivability of eubacteria and secondly, it is absent in humans. The last decade has seen tremendous inputs in deciphering the 3-D structures of the PG biosynthetic enzymes. Many inhibitors against these enzymes have been developed using virtual and high throughput screening techniques. This review discusses the mechanistic and structural properties of the PG biosynthetic enzymes and inhibitors developed in the last decade.", "year": "2011"}
