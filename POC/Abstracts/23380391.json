{"title": "Adult hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae.", "abstract": "Hemolyitic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by triad of acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia, has considerable morbidity and mortality and is known to be associated with diarrheal illness. It usually occurs after a diarrheal illness due to Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a rare but well recognized trigger for non-diarrhea associated HUS in children, but has not been reported in adults. We report a case of an adult presenting with pneumococcal pneumonia complicated by HUS and required renal replacement therapy.", "year": "2014"}
