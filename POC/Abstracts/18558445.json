{"title": "Microtiter plate bioassay to monitor the interference of antibiotics with the lipid II cycle essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis.", "abstract": "Specific drug-sensing systems that coordinate appropriate genetic responses assure the survival of microorganisms in the presence of antibiotics. We report on the development and application of a microtiter plate-based bioassay for the identification of antibiotics interfering with the lipid II cycle essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. A Bacillus subtilis reporter strain sensing specifically lipid II - interfering cell wall biosynthesis stress (T. Mascher, S.L. Zimmer, T.-A. Smith and J. Helmann, Antibiotic-inducible promoter regulated by the cell envelope stress-sensing two-component system LiaRS of Bacillus subtilis; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Vol 48 (2004) pp. 2888-2896) was analyzed in the presence of different lantibiotics. We could show dose-dependent cell wall biosynthesis stress of reporter cells in response to the action of the lantibiotics subtilin produced by B. subtilis, epidermin and gallidermin of Staphylococcus epidermidis or S. gallinarum, respectively, in both, agar-plate and liquid culture-based assays. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Our results show that our system can be used for screening purposes, for example to discover novel inhibitors of cell wall biosynthesis.", "year": "2008"}
