{"title": "Concurrence of Pendred syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, and simple goiter in one family.", "abstract": "Pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness. There is no specific biochemical marker of this disease, and the diagnosis depends upon the demonstration of the triad of congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and abnormal perchlorate discharge test. Pendred syndrome is caused by mutations within the putative ion transporter gene (PDS gene), located on chromosome 7q. A wide variation in the clinical presentation of this condition, and its well documented phenotypic overlap with other thyroid disorders (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis), can lead to diagnostic difficulties. The potential for misdiagnosis increases when these disorders occur coincidentally in the same family. We describe a kindred in which Pendred syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, and simple goiter coexisted, to highlight these diagnostic pitfalls and to illustrate the use of mutational analysis in resolving diagnostic confusion.", "year": "1999"}
