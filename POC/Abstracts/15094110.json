{"title": "The thrombospondin type 1 repeat superfamily.", "abstract": "The TSR superfamily is a diverse family of extracellular matrix and transmembrane proteins, many of which have functions related to regulating matrix organization, cell-cell interactions and cell guidance. This review samples some of the contemporary literature regarding TSR superfamily members (e.g. F-spondin, UNC-5, ADAMTS, papilin, and TRAP) where specific functions are assigned to the TSR domains. Combining these observations with the published crystal structure of the TSRs of thrombospondin-1 may hold a key to the development of therapeutic agents for fighting parasitic infection and tumor growth.", "year": "2004"}
