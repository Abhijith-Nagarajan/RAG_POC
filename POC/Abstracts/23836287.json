{"title": "MiRNA expression signature for potentially predicting the prognosis of ovarian serous carcinoma.", "abstract": "One of the best prognostic predictors for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer is the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) stage at diagnosis. Advanced-stage ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC) generally have poor prognosis. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a miRNA expression profile that can differentiate the OSC at early and advanced stages and study its correlation with the prognosis of OSC. To identify a unique microRNA (miRNA) pattern associated with the progression of OSC at early and advanced stages, a miRNA microarray was performed using Chinese tumor bank specimens of patients with OSC stage I or III in a retrospective analysis. The expression of four dysregulated miRNAs was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in an external cohort of 51 cases of OSC samples at stages I and III. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the expression of some miRNAs and prognosis. Of the 768 miRNAs analyzed in the microarray, 26 miRNAs were significantly either up- or downregulated, with at least a 2-fold difference, in OSC stage I compared with stage III. The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-510, miR-509-5p, and miR-508-3p were significantly downregulated and that miR-483-5p was upregulated in stage III OSC compared with stage I, which was consistent with the microarray results. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that miRNAs may play a role in the progression of OSC, and miR-510 and miR-509-5p may be considered novel-candidate clinical biomarkers for predicting OSC outcome.", "year": "2013"}
