{"title": "Personality change in dementia of the Alzheimer's type: relations to caregiver personality and burden.", "abstract": "Using the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI), we evaluated caregivers' perceptions of personality prior to symptom onset and current personality in 36 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Caregivers also completed the self form of the NEO-PI and an index of objective and subjective burden. Personality change in DAT was consistent with previous reports of increased neuroticism, decreased extraversion, and decreased conscientiousness, with smaller decreases in openness and agreeableness. Significant relationships were found among perceived present patient personality, caregiver personality, and caregiver burden. Regression analyses indicated that present patient conscientiousness and caregiver neuroticism were the best predictors of both objective and subjective burden, and these variables were found to contribute independently to caregivers' reported level of burden. To the extent that caregivers perceive specific behaviors and interferences negatively, cognitive and supportive interventions are likely to prove extremely beneficial.", "year": "1995"}
