{"title": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome in children in Puerto Rico: a rare disease with atypical features.", "abstract": "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) consists ofa triad of acquired hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure that occurs acutely in otherwise healthy individuals. HUS may be divided into two broad categories, typical, preceded by a diarrheal prodrome, and atypical. The clinical symptoms of HUS as well as its course, prognosis, and response to treatment appear to be significantly influenced by a number of factors, including age at onset, type and severity of underlying infections, and/or systemic diseases. A retrospective case series review of five patients diagnosed with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome at the Pediatric University Hospital in Puerto Rico between 1997-2007 was performed. The study showed that the incidence of HUS in children in Puerto Rico is lower than other countries. However, the majority of cases have an atypical presentation, which places our patients at higher risk for life-threatening complications.", "year": "2008"}
