{"title": "Cohesin, CTCF and lymphocyte antigen receptor locus rearrangement.", "abstract": "The somatic recombination of lymphocyte antigen receptor loci is integral to lymphocyte differentiation and adaptive immunity. Here we review the relation of this highly choreographed process with the zinc finger protein CTCF and with cohesin, a protein complex best known for its essential functions in post-replicative DNA repair and chromosome segregation during the cell cycle. At lymphocyte antigen receptor loci, CTCF and cohesin shape long-range interactions and contribute to V(D)J recombination by facilitating lineage- and developmental-stage-specific transcription and accessibility.", "year": "2012"}
