{"title": "Influence of running and walking on hormonal regulators of appetite in women.", "abstract": "Nine female runners and ten walkers completed a 60\u2009min moderate-intensity (70% VO(2)max) run or walk, or 60\u2009min rest in counterbalanced order. Plasma concentrations of the orexogenic peptide ghrelin, anorexogenic peptides peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and appetite ratings were measured at 30\u2009min interval for 120\u2009min, followed by a free-choice meal. Both orexogenic and anorexogenic peptides were elevated after running, but no changes were observed after walking. Relative energy intake (adjusted for cost of exercise/rest) was negative in the meal following running (-194 \u00b1 206\u2009kcal) versus walking (41 \u00b1 196\u2009kcal) (P = 0.015), although both were suppressed (P < 0.05) compared to rest (299 \u00b1 308 and 284 \u00b1 121\u2009kcal, resp.). The average rate of change in PYY and GLP-1 over time predicted appetite in runners, but only the change in GLP-1 predicted hunger (P = 0.05) in walkers. Results provide evidence that exercise-induced alterations in appetite are likely driven by complex changes in appetite-regulating hormones rather than change in a single gut peptide.", "year": "2012"}
