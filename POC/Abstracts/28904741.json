Strain R3.8 was sequenced in order to help discover potential cold active enzymes with biotechnological applications. Genome analysis identified various cold adaptation genes including some coding for anti-freeze proteins and cold-shock proteins, genes involved in bioremediation of xenobiotic compounds including naphthalene, and genes with chitinolytic and -acetylglucosamine utilization properties and also plant-growth-influencing properties. In this genome report, we present a complete genome sequence of  strain R3.8 and its annotation data, which will facilitate exploitation of potential novel cold-active enzymes.'}", "year": "2017"}
