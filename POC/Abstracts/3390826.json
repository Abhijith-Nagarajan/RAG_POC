{"title": "Indistinguishable patterns of protooncogene expression in two distinct but closely related tumors: Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma.", "abstract": "Genetic characterization of human tumors promises new insights of biological importance and clinical relevance. We have found that two solid tumors, peripheral neuroepithelioma and Ewing's sarcoma of bone, which share a common cytogenetic rearrangement, are characterized by an indistinguishable and highly reproducible pattern of protooncogene expression. c-myc, N-myc, c-myb, and c-mil/raf-1 are all expressed at similar levels in these tumors. c-fes and c-sis expression was not detected in any specimens of either tumor. In contrast, the protooncogene c-ets-1, located near the breakpoint of the chromosomal translocation in these tumors, is variable in its expression. We also detected high levels of choline acetyltransferase in these tumors, which suggests a common neural origin. Since it is likely that the clinical behavior and therapeutic responsiveness of tumors relate closely to their biological and genetic features, the pattern of protooncogene expression of individual tumors may provide a novel basis for their characterization.", "year": "1988"}
