{"title": "Ichthyosis follicularis with atrichia and photophobia (IFAP) syndrome in two unrelated female patients.", "abstract": "The IFAP syndrome is characterized by the congenital onset of ichthyosis follicularis, absence of hair, and photophobia. A limited number of patients with the disorder have been described, and X-linked recessive inheritance has been proposed. Two unrelated female patients with a complete IFAP syndrome are reported. Both patients show a diffuse distribution of the disorder without linear arrangement. Because the suggested X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance is unlikely in these patients, a different way of transmission or, alternatively, genetic heterogeneity of the disorder has to be considered.", "year": "2002"}
