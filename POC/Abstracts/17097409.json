{"title": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex's syndrome): association with liposarcoma.", "abstract": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex's syndrome) is a rare obligate paraneoplastic dermatosis characterized by erythematosquamous lesions localized symmetrically at the acral sites. The condition almost exclusively affects Caucasian men older than 40 years. It is usually associated with primary malignant neoplasms of the upper aerodigestive tract. In most cases, the skin changes precede the clinical manifestation of the underlying neoplasm. The dermatosis can be cured only by removal of the underlying carcinoma. We describe a case of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica associated with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma in a 71-year-old Caucasian man. The liposarcoma was surgically removed but recurred several times, with acrokeratosis paraneoplastica showing a parallel development. We, therefore, add liposarcoma to the growing list of malignant neoplasms associated with acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.", "year": "2006"}
