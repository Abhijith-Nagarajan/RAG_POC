{"title": "Do personality traits predict the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease?", "abstract": "To identify specific premorbid personality traits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A prospective case-control study. A memory clinic of a department of geriatric medicine in a teaching hospital. Fifty-six consecutive patients with probable AD. Sixty-five controls with Parkinson's disease (PD). Premorbid personality traits were assessed using the relative rating version of the Munich Personality Test (MPT). The AD patients showed higher neuroticism than the controls with PD (p=0.013). In comparison with MPT normative values for psychiatric inpatients, the AD patients scored significantly (p<0.05) lower on neuroticism and higher on frustration tolerance and rigidity. Our results support the assumption of specific premorbid characteristics in AD patients, ie increased neuroticism and rigidity. More research is needed to confirm the existence of typical premorbid personality traits in AD.", "year": "2000"}
