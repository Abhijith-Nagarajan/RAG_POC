{"title": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex' syndrome). Report of a case and review of the literature.", "abstract": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex' syndrome) is a rare but clinically distinctive dermatosis that has been associated in all reported cases, to our knowledge, with either a primary malignant neoplasm of the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer to the lymph nodes of the neck. Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica was found in a 53-year-old black man with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil. A distinctive series of changes was found on histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens taken from his skin lesions, and direct immunofluorescence microscopy of both lesional and nonlesional skin specimens showed immunoglobulin and complement deposition on the epidermal basement membrane. The skin lesions largely resolved following radiation therapy of the neoplasm and of the presumably involved lymph nodes.", "year": "1983"}
