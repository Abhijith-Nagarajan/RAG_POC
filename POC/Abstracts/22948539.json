{"title": "Pulsed electromagnetic field stimulates osteoprotegerin and reduces RANKL expression in ovariectomized rats.", "abstract": "Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been shown to increase bone mineral density in osteoporosis patients and prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats. But the mechanisms through which PEMF elicits these favorable biological responses are still not fully understood. Receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are cytokines predominantly secreted by osteoblasts and play a central role in differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of PEMF on RANKL and OPG expression in ovariectomized rats. Thirty 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated control (Sham), ovariectomy control (OVX), and ovariectomy with PEMF treatment (PEMF). After 12-week interventions, the results showed that PEMF increased serum 17\u03b2-estradiol level, reduced serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase level, increased bone mineral density, and inhibited deterioration of bone microarchitecture and strength in OVX rats. Furthermore, PEMF could suppress RANKL expression and improve OPG expression in bone marrow cells of OVX rats. In conclusion, this study suggests that PEMF can prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss through regulating the expression of RANKL and OPG.", "year": "2013"}
