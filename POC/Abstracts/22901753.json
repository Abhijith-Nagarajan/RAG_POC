{"title": "Brucella abortus-infected macrophages modulate T lymphocytes to promote osteoclastogenesis via IL-17.", "abstract": "The pathogenic mechanisms of bone loss caused by Brucella species have not been completely deciphered. Although T lymphocytes (LTs) are considered important to control infection, the mechanism of Brucella-induced T-cell responses to immunopathological features is not known. We present in vitro and in vivo evidence showing that Brucella abortus-induced inflammatory response leads to the activation of LTs, which further promote osteoclastogenesis. Pre-activated murine LTs treated with culture supernatant from macrophages infected with B. abortus induced bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs) to undergo osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, osteoclastogenesis was mediated by CD4(+) T cells. Although B. abortus-activated T cells actively secreted the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines RANKL and IL-17, osteoclastogenesis depended on IL-17, because osteoclast generation induced by Brucella-activated T cells was completely abrogated when these cells were cultured with BMMs from IL-17 receptor knockout mice. Neutralization experiments indicated that IL-6, generated by Brucella infection, induced the production of pro-osteoclastogenic IL-17 from LTs. By using BMMs from tumor necrosis factor receptor p55 knockout mice, we also demonstrated that IL-17 indirectly induced osteoclastogenesis through the induction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 from osteoclast precursors. Finally, extensive and widespread osteoclastogenesis was observed in the knee joints of mice injected with Brucella-activated T cells. Our results indicate that activated T cells, elicited by B. abortus-infected macrophages and influenced by the inflammatory milieu, promote the generation of osteoclasts, leading to bone loss.", "year": "2012"}
