{"title": "Effects of exercise on the levels of peptide YY and ghrelin.", "abstract": "Ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) are brain-gut peptides that have a variety of physiological functions and are involved in energy regulation. Thus far, abnormalities in the expression and secretion of ghrelin and PYY are known to occur in lifestyle-related diseases, including obesity, and the improvement of these abnormalities has become an important challenge. Exercise has recently been reported to influence ghrelin and PYY concentrations. Exercise increases the PYY secretion. The effects of exercise on ghrelin levels vary with the study subject, timing of exercise, and duration of exercise. Here, we review the findings of recent studies on the association of PYY and ghrelin with obesity, particularly, on the influence of exercise on PYY and ghrelin levels.", "year": "2011"}
