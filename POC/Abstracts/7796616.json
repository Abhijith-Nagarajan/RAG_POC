{"title": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex syndrome) with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "A 65-year-old white man presented with all the clinical features of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex, characterized by violaceous erythema and scaling of the nose, aural helices, fingers, and toes, with keratoderma and severe nail dystrophy. Examination of the patient for possible associated malignancy disclosed an asymptomatic squamous cell carcinoma at the oropharyngeal region. The skin lesions resolved almost completely following radiation therapy of the neoplasm, but the onychodystrophy persisted. This case report illustrates the importance of early recognition of Bazex syndrome.", "year": "1995"}
