{"title": "Further delineation of the ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia syndrome.", "abstract": "We describe an 18-month-old male infant suffering from the ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia (IFAP) syndrome and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Severe retardation of growth and psychomotor development, chill-like seizures, bronchial asthma, urticaria, a proneness to skin infections and transient nail dystrophy observed in our patient are non-obligatory manifestations of this disorder. Histological examination of the atrichia revealed poorly developed, shortened hair follicles and a complete absence of sebaceous glands. The sex ratio of published cases suggests an X-linked recessive inheritance. The marked clinical variability of the IFAP syndrome might be the expression of a contiguous gene defect.", "year": "1991"}
