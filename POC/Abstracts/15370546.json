Clinical ophthalmological examination of all patients and fundus photography of the carrier mother were performed. Both affected male children had severe photophobia, total superficial and deep corneal vascularization, and reduction of vision to counting fingers.The mother had tortuous retinal vessels. Males with IFAP have an inexorable progression of corneal vascularization and loss of vision. Retinal vascular tortuosity may be another clinical sign of carrier status in females.", "year": "2004"}
