{"title": "[Paraneoplastic palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Minor form of acrokeratosis neoplastica Bazex?].", "abstract": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica Bazex is a rare, obligate paraneoplasia initially presenting with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Later stages show acral psoriasiform lesions on other parts of the body. Common associated malignancies are laryngeal cancer and other tumors of the head or neck region or neck lymph node metastases. A 49-year-old woman presented with palmoplantar hyperkeratoses for 4\u00a0months; in addition she had a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. We diagnosed a minor form of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica Bazex. Some authors consider this as a separate entity, but the well- known course argues against this hypothesis. We report a case and review the literature.", "year": "2012"}
