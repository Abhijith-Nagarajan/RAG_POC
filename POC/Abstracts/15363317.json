One-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect a characteristic EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript in 25 cases of ES/pPNET and 15 cases of other small round cell tumors (including 8 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 cases of synovial sarcoma, 2 cases of neuroblastoma and 1 case of lymphoma) using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript was detected in 20 of the 25 ES/pPNET cases (80%). The 15 non-ES/pPNET control cases were negative for EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript. Detection of EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript is a reliable index for molecular diagnosis of ES/pPNET. One-step RT-PCR is a practical method for such analysis in routine paraffin-embedded tumor tissues.", "year": "2004"}
