{"title": "Beyond abiraterone: new hormonal therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.", "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease where the previous concept of \"hormone resistance\" has been changed by a new generation of hormonal therapies that have proven efficacy in the castration-resistant setting. The fact is that androgens play a crucial role in the whole clinical course of prostate cancer, even when a patient meets castration-resistance criteria. The development of abiraterone showed how important and clinically meaningful can be to achieve the lowest possible levels of testosterone, and androgen receptor overexpression, mutation, or enhanced crosstalk with other pathways, which can also be targeted with new agents tested in the last few years. New androgen biosynthesis inhibitors have been developed, such as orteronel (TAK-700), but also new antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201) or even agents with a dual mechanism of action (galeterone). In this review the development of new hormonal therapies following the arrival of abiraterone for the treatment of prostate cancer will be summarized.", "year": "2014"}
