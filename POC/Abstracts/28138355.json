B6 is a Gram-positive, non-motile, facultative aerobic bacterium, isolated from the arsenic-contaminated aquifer sediment in the Datong basin, China. This strain displays high resistance to arsenic, and can dynamically transform arsenic under aerobic condition. Here, we described the high quality draft genome sequence, annotations and the features of  sp. B6. The G\\u2009+\\u2009C content of the genome is 64.67%. This strain has a genome size of 4,663,437\\xa0bp; the genome is arranged in 8 scaffolds that contain 25 contigs. From the sequences, 3956 protein-coding genes, 264 pseudo genes and 89 tRNA/rRNA-encoding genes were identified. The genome analysis of this strain helps to better understand the mechanism by which the microbe efficiently tolerates arsenic in the arsenic-contaminated environment.'}", "year": "2017"}
