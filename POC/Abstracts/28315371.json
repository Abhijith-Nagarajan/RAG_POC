{"title": "Complete genome sequence of Arthrobacter sp. ZXY-2 associated with effective atrazine degradation and salt adaptation.", "abstract": "An atrazine-degrading strain Arthrobacter sp. ZXY-2 was originally isolated from Jilin Pesticide Plant (China). Strain ZXY-2 demonstrated excellent atrazine degradation performance and saline tolerance. Here we report the complete genome sequence of strain ZXY-2 contained a circular chromosome and five circular plasmids encoding for the mechanism of salt adaptation and pollutant degradation.", "year": "2017"}
