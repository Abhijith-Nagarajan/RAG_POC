{"title": "Metformin stimulates osteoprotegerin and reduces RANKL expression in osteoblasts and ovariectomized rats.", "abstract": "Anti-diabetic drug metformin has been shown to enhance osteoblasts differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro and prevent bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. But the mechanisms through which metformin regulates osteoclastogensis are not known. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) are cytokines predominantly secreted by osteoblasts and play critical roles in the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. In this study, we demonstrated that metformin dose-dependently stimulated OPG and reduced RANKL mRNA and protein expression in mouse calvarial osteoblasts and osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. Inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK), two targets of metformin, suppressed endogenous and metformin-induced OPG secretion in osteoblasts. Moreover, supernatant of osteoblasts treated with metformin reduced formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multi-nucleated cells in Raw264.7 cells. Most importantly, metformin significantly increased total body bone mineral density, prevented bone loss and decreased TRAP-positive cells in OVX rats proximal tibiae, accompanied with an increase of OPG and decrease of RANKL expression. These in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that metformin reduces RANKL and stimulates OPG expression in osteoblasts, further inhibits osteoclast differentiation and prevents bone loss in OVX rats.", "year": "2011"}
