{"title": "Comparison of Ewing's sarcoma of bone and peripheral neuroepithelioma. An immunocytochemical and ultrastructural analysis of two primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms.", "abstract": "Ewing's sarcoma of bone (ESB) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are frequently considered to be different tumors. Some researchers have suggested that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma. We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases). Light microscopic, ultrastructural, and immunophenotypic parameters were assessed and compared for both groups. The avidin-biotin complex method was used. All tumors were antigenically intact since all stained for vimentin or at least one marker. Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB. In ESB, an atypical light microscopic appearance correlated with the presence of neuroectodermal features in most cases, but neuroectodermal phenotype was more frequent (68%) than morphological evidence of neuroectodermal differentiation (36%). These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation.", "year": "1994"}
