{"title": "Regulation of NF-\u03baB by ubiquitination and degradation of the I\u03baBs.", "abstract": "The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway is a busy ground for the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome system; many of the signaling steps are coordinated by protein ubiquitination. The end point of this pathway is to induce transcription, and to this end, there is a need to overcome a major obstacle, a set of inhibitors (I\u03baBs) that bind NF-\u03baB and prohibit either the nuclear entry or the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are required for the elimination of the inhibitors: activation of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors. IKK activation and I\u03baB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, \u03b2-TrCP, recognizes the I\u03baB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples I\u03baB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) -mediated I\u03baB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of \u03b2-TrCP results in accumulation of all the I\u03baBs and complete NF-\u03baB inhibition. As many details of I\u03baB-\u03b2-TrCP interaction have been worked out, the development of \u03b2-TrCP inhibitors might be a feasible therapeutic approach for NF-\u03baB-associated human disease. However, we may still need to advance our understanding of the mechanism of I\u03baB degradation as well as of the diverse functions of \u03b2-TrCP in vivo.", "year": "2012"}
