{"title": "The TGF\u03b2 receptor-interacting protein km23-1/DYNLRB1 plays an adaptor role in TGF\u03b21 autoinduction via its association with Ras.", "abstract": "We have previously elucidated the signaling events that are required for TGF\u03b21 autoinduction (Yue, J., and Mulder, K. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 30765-30773). Further, we have reported that the TGF\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2R)-interacting protein km23-1 plays an important role in TGF\u03b2 signal transduction (Jin, Q., Ding, W., and Mulder, K. M. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 19122-19132). Here we examined the role of km23-1 in TGF\u03b21 autoinduction in TGF\u03b2-sensitive epithelial cells. siRNA blockade of km23-1 reduced TGF\u03b21 mRNA expression, as well as DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the relevant activator protein-1 site in the human TGF\u03b21 promoter. Further, knockdown of km23-1 inhibited TGF\u03b2-mediated activation of ERK and JNK, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and transactivation of the c-Jun promoter. Sucrose gradient analyses indicate that km23-1 was present in lipid rafts together with Ras and T\u03b2RII after TGF\u03b2 treatment. Immunoprecipitation/blot analyses revealed the formation of a TGF\u03b2-inducible complex between Ras and km23-1 in vivo within minutes of TGF\u03b2 addition. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that km23-1 is required for Ras activation by TGF\u03b2. Our results indicate that km23-1 is required for TGF\u03b21 autoinduction through Smad2-independent Ras/ERK/JNK pathways. More importantly, our findings demonstrate that km23-1 functions as a critical adaptor coupling T\u03b2R activation to activation of Ras effector pathways downstream.", "year": "2012"}
