{"title": "Pneumococcal infection and hemolytic uremic syndrome.", "abstract": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome, one of the common causes of acute renal failure in children, is characterized by the triad of microangiopathy, haemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. The diarrhoea-associated Hemolytic uremic syndrome is usually termed as a typical Hemolytic uremic syndrome. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an uncommon etiological pathogen for inducing Hemolytic uremic syndrome, and Streptococcus pneumoniae associated Hemolytic uremic syndrome is also termed as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. to report two pediatric cases of invasive S pneumoniae complicated with hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS. The first patient presented with pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema and the second patient presented with pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis. The two patients were under one year of age and required peritoneal dialysis with improvement of renal function in one; the other died. Pneumococcal invasive disease may be a cause of severe HUS, so a high index of suspicion is mandatory to prompt appropriate diagnosis and management.", "year": "2009"}
