{"title": "Changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite-controlling hormones and cytokines after a treatment program in overweight adolescents: preliminary findings from the EVASYON study.", "abstract": "We investigated the effects of the EVASYON program on body fatness, cardiometabolic risk factors, gut appetite-controlling hormones and serum levels of cytokines in adolescents with overweight or obesity (OW/OB). This study comprised 13 boys (10 obese) and 12 girls (8 obese), aged 13-16 years, from a Madrid Hospital. The EVASYON program was based on a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%), increased physical activity (at least 60 min/day 5 days a week), psychological therapy and nutritional education for 13 months. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were measured before and after intervention. Serum glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, total peptide YY and insulin levels were determined before and after intervention. Serum levels of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 were also assessed before and after intervention. A decrease in body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, skinfolds (triceps, biceps, subscapular, thigh, and calf), sum of six skinfolds and body circumferences (arm relaxed and flexed, waist, hip, and proximal thigh) values were observed after the intervention program (all p < 0.05). In addition, diastolic blood pressure also decreased (p < 0.05). A decrease in serum leptin levels (-48.4%, p < 0.001) was observed after intervention without changes in total peptide YY and insulin levels. Levels of IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 also decreased (all p < 0.05) after the intervention program. These preliminary results evidence that the EVASYON program may improve body fat, leptin, and some pro-inflammatory cytokines in adolescents with OW/OB.", "year": "2011"}
