{"title": "Molecular detection of EWS-FLI1 chimeric transcripts in Ewing family tumors by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: application to archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissues.", "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations generating unique chimeric genes are highly characteristic of specific sarcomas, and their use as diagnostic markers has been suggested. From a diagnostic pathologic point of view, detection of such cytogenetic or molecular aberrations applicable to routinely processed archival tissue specimens is considered a powerful tool for tumor diagnosis. To assess the feasibility and reliability of the molecular detection of the transcript originating from the chimeric gene in paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, we performed a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay to detect the EWS-FLI1 chimeric message in a series of Ewing family tumors. Of 24 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 23 cases analyzed, the chimeric message was detectable in 20 (83%) specimens from 20 cases (87%) by this nested RT-PCR assay, whereas none of 7 small round cell tumors not from this family (3 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 neuroblastomas, 2 malignant lymphomas) showed detectable chimeric messages. In the sequence analysis of the PCR products, the amplified chimeric messages contained the junctions between exon 7 of the EWS gene and any one of exons 5, 6 and 8 of the FLI1 gene. The detection process was usually completed within 3 days, except for the subseqent sequence analysis. Our results endorse the use of this molecular assay as an ancillary technique in the diagnosis of Ewing family tumors using paraffin-embedded material.", "year": "1999"}
