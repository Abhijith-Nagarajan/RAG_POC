{"title": "A cytosine methyltransferase converts 5-methylcytosine in DNA to thymine.", "abstract": "Sites of cytosine methylation are known to be hot spots for C.G to T.A mutations in a number of systems, including human cells. Traditionally, spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine has been invoked as the cause of this phenomenon. We show here that a bacterial cytosine methyltransferase can convert 5-methylcytosine in DNA to thymine and that this reaction creates a mutational hot spot at a site of DNA methylation. The reaction is fairly insensitive to the methyl donor in the reaction, S-adenosylmethionine. In many cancers, the most frequent class of mutations is C to T changes within CG dinucleotides of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Because of the similarities of the reaction mechanisms of mammalian and bacterial enzymes and the physiology of the cancer cells, this reaction is expected to contribute to mutations at CG dinucleotides in precancerous cells.", "year": "1995"}
