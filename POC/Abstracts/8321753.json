{"title": "Cytogenetics of Askin's tumour. Case report and review of the literature.", "abstract": "The eleventh cytogenetically analyzed Askin's tumour, diagnosed in a two-year-old girl, is reported. Chromosomal analysis revealed a pseudodiploid karyotype of tumour cells with translocations of t(11;22)(q24;q12) and der(4)t(2;4)(q24;q35). The observed t(11;22)(q24;q12) is not only a unique characteristic of all cytogenetically analyzed Askin's tumours but it also occurs in 92-100% of peripheral neuroepithelioma and of Ewing's sarcoma, irrespective of its osseous or extraosseous localization. This genetical similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour.", "year": "1993"}
