{"title": "Metformin Does Not Suppress Serum Thyrotropin by Increasing Levothyroxine Absorption.", "abstract": "Levothyroxine (LT4) absorption is affected by concomitant ingestion of certain minerals, medications, and foods. It has been hypothesized that metformin may suppress serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations by enhancing LT4 absorption or by directly affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This study examined the effect of metformin ingestion on LT4 absorption, as assessed by serum total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations. A modified Food and Drug Administration LT4 bioequivalence protocol was applied to healthy, metformin-na\u00efve, euthyroid adult volunteers. Following an overnight fast, 600\u2009\u03bcg LT4 was administered orally. Serum TT4 concentrations were measured at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6\u2009h following LT4 administration. Measurements were performed before and after one week of metformin ingestion (850\u2009mg three times daily). Peak serum TT4 concentrations, time to peak TT4 concentrations, and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were calculated. Twenty-six subjects (54% men, 27% white, age 33\u2009\u00b1\u200910 years) were studied. There were no significant differences in peak serum TT4 concentrations (p\u2009=\u20090.13) and time to peak TT4 concentrations (p\u2009=\u20090.19) before and after one week of metformin use. A trend toward reduced TT4 AUC was observed after metformin ingestion (pre-metformin 3893\u2009\u00b1\u2009568\u2009\u03bcg/dL-min, post-metformin 3765\u2009\u00b1\u2009588\u2009\u03bcg/dL-min, p\u2009=\u20090.09). LT4 absorption is unchanged by concomitant metformin ingestion. Mechanisms other than increased LT4 absorption may be responsible for the suppressed TSH concentrations observed in patients ingesting both drugs.", "year": "2015"}
