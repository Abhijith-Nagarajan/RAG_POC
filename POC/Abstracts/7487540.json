{"title": "[Reversible cerebral changes in hemolytic-uremic syndrome].", "abstract": "The hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a pathology characterized by a triad consisting of acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, with complications of the central nervous system arising in a considerable number of cases. Altered cranial computerized tomography examinations usually reveal cerebral infarctions. We present here two cases in which diffuse hypodensity was observed in the white matter in addition to the infarcts. This hypodensity was reversible after resolution of the acute phase of the disease, as is also the case for the alterations described in uremic encephalopathy and in hypertensive encephalopathy of other etiologies.", "year": "1995"}
