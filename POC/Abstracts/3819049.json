{"title": "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex' syndrome).", "abstract": "A 55-year-old white man born in Canada presented with all the clinical features of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica of Bazex. He showed the characteristic violaceous erythema and scaling of the nose and face, the aural helices, and the palmoplantar regions with severe nail dystrophy. Extensive examinations failed to reveal any associated malignancy up to 5 months after the onset of the skin eruption. While the skin was improving, and although the patient was still asymptomatic except for a weight loss of 5 kg, evidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical region was obtained. Only palliative treatment could be undertaken. The bizarre clinical aspects of the syndrome are reviewed.", "year": "1987"}
