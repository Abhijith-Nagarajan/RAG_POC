{"title": "Jellyfish collagen stimulates production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 by J774.1 cells through activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK via TLR4 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "We previously reported that jellyfish collagen stimulates both the acquired and innate immune responses. In the acquired immune response, jellyfish collagen enhanced immunoglobulin production by lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, in the innate immune response jellyfish collagen promoted cytokine production and phagocytotic activity of macrophages. The facts that jellyfish collagen plays several potential roles in stimulating cytokine production by macrophages have further attracted us to uncover its mechanisms. We herein describe that the cytokine production-stimulating activity of jellyfish collagen was canceled by a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor. Moreover, jellyfish collagen stimulated phosphorylation of inhibitor of \u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1), promoted the translocation of nucleus factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). A JNK inhibitor also abrogated the cytokine production-stimulating activity of jellyfish collagen. These results suggest that jellyfish collagen may facilitate cytokine production by macrophages through activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK via the TLR4 signaling pathways.", "year": "2014"}
