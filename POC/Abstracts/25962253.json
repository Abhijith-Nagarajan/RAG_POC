{"title": "[SGLT2 inhibitors: a new therapeutic class for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus].", "abstract": "SGLT2 (Sodium Glucose co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors) inhibitors are a new group of oral medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. These medications interfere with the process of glucose reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules in the kidneys, therefore increasing both glucose and water diuresis. SGLT2 inhibitors were found to be effective in lowering HbA1c levels in double-blinded studies, both as monotherapy and in combination with other oral hypoglycemic medications of various other mechanisms of action. SGLT2 Inhibitors are not a risk factor for hypoglycemia and are suitable for combination with insulin therapy. Their unique mode of action, relying on glomerular filtration, make these medication unsuitable for usage as treatment for type 2 diabetes patients who are also suffering from moderate to severe renal failure. Their main adverse effects are increased risk for urinary and genital tract infections. The following review describes the relevant pathophysiology addressed by these novel medications, evidence for efficacy and the safety profile of SGLT2 Inhibitors.", "year": "2015"}
