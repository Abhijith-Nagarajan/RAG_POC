Choline metabolism in regulating inflammatory bowel disease-linked anxiety disorders: A multi-omics exploration of the gut-brain axis.,"Anxiety and depression caused by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) negatively affect the mental health of patients. Emerging studies have demonstrated that the gut-brain axis (GBA) mediates IBD-induced mood disorders, but the underlying mechanisms of these findings remain unknown. Therefore, it's vital to conduct comprehensive research on the GBA in IBD. Multi-omics studies can provide an understanding of the pathological mechanisms of the GBA in the development of IBD, helping to uncover the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of the disease. Thus, we analyzed the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS)-induced IBD mice using transcriptomics and metabolomics. We observed increased mRNA related to acetylcholine synthesis and secretion, along with decreased phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels in the PFC of DSS group compared to the control group. Fecal metagenomics also revealed abnormalities in the microbiome and lipid metabolism in the DSS group. Since both acetylcholine and PC are choline metabolites, we posited that the DSS group may experience choline deficiency and choline metabolism disorders. Subsequently, when we supplemented CDP-choline, IBD mice exhibited improvements, including decreased anxiety-like behaviors, reduced PC degradation, and increased acetylcholine synthesis in the PFC. In addition, administration of CDP-choline can restore imbalances in the gut microbiome and disruptions in lipid metabolism caused by DSS treatment. This study provides compelling evidence to suggest that choline metabolism plays a crucial role in the development and treatment of mood disorders in IBD. Choline and its metabolites appear to have a significant role in maintaining the stability of the GBA.",2024
Selective corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptor antagonist E2508 has potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like properties in rodent models.,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress, and CRF antagonists may be effective for the treatment of stress-related disorders including major depressive and anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated the in vivo pharmacological profile of N-cyclopropylmethyl-7-(2,6-dimethoxy-4-methoxymethylphenyl)-2-ethyl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylmethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-amine tosylate (E2508), a recently synthesized, orally active CRF1 receptor antagonist. Oral administration of a single dose of E2508 (3 or 10mg/kg), but not fluoxetine (30mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), significantly shortened immobility time in rats in the forced swim test. E2508 (10, 30, or 100mg/kg) also showed an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test in mice, with no sedative or muscle relaxant effects for doses up to 100mg/kg. Moreover, E2508 (5 or 20mg/kg) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in the rat defensive burying test. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, also showed an anxiolytic effect in the defensive burying test at the same dose that induced a muscle relaxant effect in mice. Administration of E2508 (30mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days did not affect sexual behavior. By contrast, fluoxetine (30mg/kg) administration for ≥7 consecutive days decreased sexual behavior. These results indicate that E2508 has both potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models, and is well tolerated compared with a commonly prescribed therapeutic SSRI or benzodiazepine.",2016
Behavior and the cholinergic parameters in olfactory bulbectomized female rodents: Difference between rats and mice.,"Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in rodents induces a wide spectrum of functional disturbances, including behavioral, neurochemical, and neuromorphological alterations. We have examined the effects of OBX on behavior and the parameters of the cholinergic system in female rats and mice. In rats, OBX resulted in the appearance of some depressive-like behavioral marks, such as the decreased sucrose consumption, hyperactivity, impaired short-term memory and anxiety-like behavioral features, such as shortened presence in the center of the open field arena or open arms of the elevated plus-maze and an enhancement of avoidance behavior. These behavioral abnormalities could be associated with disturbances in hippocampal function, this suggestion being supported by the presence of cellular changes in this brain structure. No effect of OBX on the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band as well as on the acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity in the septum, hippocampus, and neocortex could be detected. In contrast, in mice, OBX impaired spontaneous alternation behavior and decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band. These data demonstrate that rats and mice differently respond to OBX, in particular, OBX does not significantly affect the cholinergic system in rats.",2016
The role of the cholinergic system in the signal attenuation rat model of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"In comparison to studies of the involvement of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), research on the involvement of the cholinergic system in this disorder has remained sparse. The aim of this study was to test the role of the cholinergic system in compulsive behavior using the signal attenuation rat model of OCD. In this model, ""compulsive"" behavior is induced by attenuating a signal indicating that a lever-press response was effective in producing food. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 mg/kg), the nicotinic agonist nicotine (0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.00 mg/kg), the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (1, 3, 5, and 8 mg/kg), the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (0.0075, 0.0150, and 0.0300 mg/kg), and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.15, 0.50, 1.00, and 1.50 mg/kg) were acutely administered to rats just before assessing their lever-press responding following signal attenuation (experiments 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively). Because the effects of signal attenuation are assessed under extinction conditions, drug doses that were effective in the above experiments were also tested in an extinction session of lever-press responding that was not preceded by signal attenuation (experiments 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Acute systemic administration of the cholinergic agents did not exert a selective anti- or pro-compulsive effect in the signal attenuation model. Acetylcholine does not seem to play a role in the signal attenuation rat model of OCD.",2013
Effects of cholinergic system of dorsal hippocampus of rats on MK-801 induced anxiolytic-like behavior.,"Some investigations have shown that the glutamate receptors play a critical role in cognitive processes such as learning and anxiety. The possible involvement of the cholinergic system of the dorsal hippocampus in the anxiolytic-like response induced by MK-801, NMDA receptor antagonist, was investigated in the present study. Male Wistar rats were used in the elevated plus maze apparatus to test the parameters: open arm time (%OAT), open arm entries (%OAE), close arm time (%CAT), close arm entries (%CAE) and other exploratory behaviors (locomotor activity, grooming, rearing and defecation) of anxiety-like response. The data indicated that intra-CA1 administration of MK-801 increased %OAT (2μg/rat) and %OAE (1 and 2μg/rat) while decreased %CAT and %CAE and did not alter other exploratory behaviors, indicating an anxiolytic-like effect. Moreover, intra-hippocampal injections of mecamylamine, a cholinergic receptor antagonists (2μg/rat) and scopolamine (4μg/rat), by themselves, 5min before testing, increased %OAT and %OAE but decreased %CAT and %CAE and did not alter locomotor activity and other exploratory behaviors, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect. On the other hand, intra-CA1 co-administration of an ineffective dose of scopolamine (3μg/rat), but not mecamylamine (1μg/rat), with an ineffective dose of MK-801 (0.5μg/rat) increased %OAT and %OAE and decreased %CAT and %CAE. The data may indicate the possible involvement of the cholinergic system of the CA1 in the anxiolytic-like response induced by MK-801.",2011
Physiologic mechanisms underlying the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.,"The rate at which serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment is terminated and the duration of treatment appear to be key factors in predicting discontinuation symptoms. The development of animal models to explain the mechanisms of this clinical problem has proved challenging, because less than half of all patients experience any discontinuation symptoms, many of which are subjective in nature. One explanation is that SRI discontinuation symptoms may arise from the rapid decrease in serotonin (5-HT) availability when treatment ends abruptly. Yet, it would appear that discontinuation discomforts may not be mediated exclusively through 5-HT receptors, given the major regulatory role 5-HT exerts on a number of specific chemical receptor systems in the brain. As a result, attempts to explain the determinants of this phenomenon rely on a certain level of speculation. This article examines the possible physiologic bases for the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome and briefly describes these adaptations. It discusses the 3 systems most likely to account for at least part of the symptomatology--the 5-HT, the norepinephrine, and the cholinergic systems--and the possible interactions among them. It also attempts to explain their implications in the therapeutic actions of antidepressants in patients with affective and anxiety disorders.",2006
Nicotine augmentation for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. A case report.,"The authors present a case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resistant to conventional treatments, which improved following nicotine augmentation administered as 4 mg chewing gum. The role of acetylcholine in the pathophysiology of OCD is not clear. The authors discuss the effect of nicotine on memory for actions.",2005
Cognitive and neurological deficits induced by early and prolonged basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction in rats.,"In the present study we examined the long-term effects of neonatal lesion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons induced by intracerebroventricular injections of the immunotoxin 192 IgG saporin. Animals were then characterised behaviourally, electrophysiologically and molecularly. Cognitive effects were evaluated in the social transmission of food preferences, a non-spatial associative memory task. Electrophysiological effects were assessed by recording of cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. In addition, we measured the levels of proteins whose abnormal expression has been associated with neurodegeneration such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PS-1, PS-2), and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). In animals lesioned on postnatal day 7 and tested 6 months thereafter, memory impairment in the social transmission of food preferences was evident, as well as a significant reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, similar to what observed in Alzheimer-like dementia, EEG cortical patterns in lesioned rats presented changes in alpha, beta and delta activities. Levels of APP protein and mRNA were not affected by the treatment. Levels of hippocampal COX-2 protein and mRNA were significantly decreased whereas COX-1 remained unaltered. PS-1 and PS-2 transcripts were reduced in hippocampus and neocortex. These findings indicate that neonatal and permanent basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction is sufficient to induce behavioural and neuropathological abnormalities. This animal model could represent a valid tool to evaluate the role played by abnormal cholinergic maturation in later vulnerability to neuropathological processes associated with cognitive decline and, possibly, to Alzheimer-like dementia.",2004
On the role of prefrontal cortex glutamate for the antithetical phenomenology of obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"1. The objective of the present study was to compare the phenomenology and pathophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/deficits in attention, motor control and perception (ADHD/DAMP). 2. Through detailed studies of the literature on OCD and ADHD/DAMP, the phenomenology of these two conditions is compared, and possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involving interactions between glutamate, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine are discussed, with emphasis on OCD. The present paper also discusses possible mechanisms of action for current pharmacological treatments of OCD and ADHD, as well as possible future treatment strategies for these disorders. 3. OCD and ADHD/DAMP are common neuropsychiatric conditions which in many regards appear to be each other's antipodes with respect to clinical manifestations, associated personality traits and brain biochemistry, notably prefrontal cortical glutamate activity. Future pharmacological treatments of these disorders may involve manipulations with glutamate, dopamine D , serotonin 2A and nicotine receptors. 4. It appears that OCD is a hyperglutamatergic and ADHD a hypoglutamatergic condition, with prefrontal brain regions being especially affected.",2001

"Smoking, nicotine and psychiatric disorders: evidence for therapeutic role, controversies and implications for future research.","Researchers interested in investigating the possible therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of action of nicotine in neuropsychiatric disorders face a social-scientific-ethical dilemma. This dilemma comprises three components: (1) the known addictive potential of nicotine makes careful evaluation of the therapeutic potential of this compound socially unattractive; (2) the potential misuse of scientifically determined data by the tobacco 'lobby' creates ethical concerns; and (3) the possible confusion between the differential effects of nicotine in human smokers versus non-smokers creates difficulties in study designs in voluntary human subjects. Therefore, it is imperative that, at the onset of this review, the authors stress that they do not advocate cigarette-smoking as a route of nicotine intake under any circumstances on the basis that controlled dosing of nicotine may be of potential benefit in some neuropsychiatric disorders. In this article, we review the psychopharmacology of nicotine and its effects in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and Tourette's syndrome. Possible mechanisms of action of nicotine directly or indirectly via its interaction with other neurotransmitter systems (i.e. serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline) in relation to its potential role in these disorders are discussed. It is postulated that new drugs may need to be developed that selectively interact with nicotinic receptors without addiction potential.",1999
Neurochemical and neuroendocrine dysregulation in affective disorders.,"Depressed patients demonstrate dysregulation in multiple neurochemical and neuroendocrine systems. The observed abnormalities are often subtle, involving ""inefficiencies"" in stress-responsive systems. Norepinephrine, acetylcholine, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are among the major biochemical and hormonal sites of dysregulation in depression.",1986
[Clinical and experimental studies of the role of neuromediator systems in the pathogenesis of neurosis and neurosis-like states].,Clinical studies revealed a significant increase in the peripheral blood levels of noradrenaline in patients with different forms of neurosis and neurosis-like states as compared to control subjects as well as heterogeneous or unidirectional but differently pronounced changes in blood levels of acetylcholine and adrenaline. Comparison of the clinical findings with the results of dynamic assays for peripheral levels of acetylcholine and catecholamine in dogs exposed to special psychogenic and physiogenic impacts has helped to form an understanding about some common mechanisms of the formation of neuroses and neurosis-like states. The authors emphasize the consistency of neuromediator shifts in the blood of patients and the possibility of using this parameter for the differential diagnosis of various forms of neurotic disturbances at the initial stage of the disease.,1986

"[Anxiety, depression and the pathology of emotion (author's transl)].","Each word in the above title, which has been graciously proposed to us, would need a long description defining its semantic contents at all organizational levels: biochemical, physiological, behavioural, psychological, sociological and so on. We have proposed an overview of the subject which is personal and interdisciplinary, but not exhaustive. We have tried to show why ""anxiety"" is due to ""action inhibition"". We have outlined the chief biochemical and neurophysiological, mechanisms which result in action inhibition. We have not entered into the nosological details of depression states. Rather, the clinical forms of depression, their common denominator, at all levels, biochemical, neurophysiological, psychological and sociological, is an outcome of the action inhibition system. We have also insisted upon the crucial role of memory and learning processes in depressive states and have added to this the process of imprinting. Finally, we have mentioned the active and retroactive (feed-back) actions of hormones and polypeptides within the brain, as well as the preferential use, in occidental civilisation, of left hemispheric rather than both, right and left interconnected hemispheric activities.",1982

The influence of experimental neurosis on the conditional reflexes and the content of blood catecholamines and acetylcholine in dogs.,"Using experimental neurosis as a model, we investigated the mode of adaptive behavior, conditional reflexes and the blood level of neuromediators in four dogs placed in certain versus uncertain conditions in a Pavlovian laboratory. The research consisted of a two year training program with predictable (ordered partial reinforcement) followed by unpredictable (probabilistic reinforcement) situations. As a result, there was a decline in the acetylcholine as compared to a rise of catecholamine levels of the peripheral blood of some of these dogs. There were varied autonomic responses indicating a possible individual response specificity. In one dog, there was a disappearance of motor defense reflexes. The results support the hypothesis that probabilistic reinforcement following ordered partial reinforcement contributed to the dogs' neurotic disintegration, i.e., uncertainty is a cause of neurotic development.",1979
[Conditioned reactions and mediator-humoral shifts during neurotization in a probabilistic pain reinforcement situation].,"Substitution of regular partial reinforcement for random one (in both cases the reinforcement frequency was 50%) acted in some dogs as a neurotizing factor: they showed unrest, stable defensive reflexes disappeared, corresponding changes were observed in vegetative reactions. At the same time activation of the sympatho-adrenal system was recorded along with a drop in concentration of acetylcholine in peripheric blood. It is noted that the development of neurotic disturbances in dogs in these conditions were to a certain degree dependent of the dominating motivation.",1978

Benzodiazepines: behavioral and neurochemical mechanisms.,"The therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines in psychoneurosis may depend in part on their ability to release or disinhibit a patient's anxiety-suppressed gratification-seeking behavior. Benzodiazepines may disinhibit behavior by reducing the activity of serotonin (and possibly acetylcholine) neurons in the brain's ""punishment"" system. Reduction of serotonin transmission may be due to a facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated presynaptic inhibition at the serotonin nerve terminal.",1977

Behavior Changes in Quinpirole Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Rats Treated with 6-Hydroxydopamine and the Corresponding Dopaminergic Compulsive Loop Mechanism.,"Recent studies suggest that the anterior limb of the internal capsule may be an area of convergence for multiple compulsion loops. In this study, the role of different dopaminergic compulsion loops in the mechanism of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was investigated by selectively damaging dopaminergic neurons or fibers in the corresponding targets with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and depicting the anatomical map of various compulsion loops located in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. A total of 52 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to either saline (1 mL/kg, NS group, n = 6) or quinpirole (QNP, dopamine D2-agonist, 0.5 mg/kg, n = 46) twice weekly for 5 weeks. After each injection, the rats were placed on an open field to analyze aspects of their behaviour, including the number of home base visits (NOH), average time between each home base visit (ATBO), and total distance travelled (TDM). After model setup, 46 QNP rats were divided randomly into five groups: 6-OHDA anterior limb of internal capsule (AC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+AC group, n = 10), 6-OHDA mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) stereotactic injection group (QNP+MD group, n = 10), 6-OHDA nucleus accumbens (NAC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+NAC group, n = 10), saline stereotactic injection group (QNP+NS-S group, n = 10), and non-surgical group (QNP+Non-S group, n = 6). In the NS group, rats simultaneously received a 6-OHDA stereotactic injection (NS+6-OHDA-S group, n = 6: AC2, MD2, NAC2). All QNP-treated rats were then continued to be given QNP twice a week for 4 weeks, and their behaviour was observed after each infusion. After 4 weeks, immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the distribution of dopamine neurons and nerve fibers in different areas of the intervention nerve loops, and quantitative analysis was performed. Compulsive behaviour declined gradually in the QNP+AC and QNP+NAC groups 3 and 4 weeks after surgery, with the QNP+AC group decreasing more rapidly. The QNP+MD group had decreased by 3 weeks after surgery but increased to almost the same level as pre-surgery at 4 weeks post-surgery. Postoperative fluorescence staining and quantitative analysis suggested the number of dopamine (DA) neurons or nerve fibers in the corresponding target area of the 6-OHDA injection were significantly reduced compared with the QNP+Non-S group. 6-OHDA selectively damages the targets of dopaminergic neurons or nerve fibers within the OCD loop, which somewhat alleviates compulsive behaviours. The results suggest that the AC might be the best target for therapeutic interventions for OCD.",2025
Unveiling serotonergic dysfunction of obsessive-compulsive disorder on prefrontal network dynamics: a computational perspective.,"Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",2024
"Now it's your turn!: Eye blink rate in a Jenga task modulated by interaction of task wait times, effortful control, and internalizing behaviors.","Dopamine is a versatile neurotransmitter with implications in many domains, including anxiety and effortful control. Where high levels of effortful control are often regarded as adaptive, other work suggests that high levels of effortful control may be a risk factor for anxiety. Dopamine signaling may be key in understanding these relations. Eye blink rate is a non-invasive proxy metric of midbrain dopamine activity. However, much work with eye blink rate has been constrained to screen-based tasks which lack in ecological validity. We tested whether changes in eye blink rate during a naturalistic effortful control task differ as a function of parent-reported effortful control and internalizing behaviors. Children played a Jenga-like game with an experimenter, but for each trial the experimenter took an increasingly long time to take their turn. Blinks-per-second were computed during each wait period. Multilevel modeling examined the relation between duration of wait period, effortful control, and internalizing behaviors on eye blink rate. We found a significant 3-way interaction between effortful control, internalizing behaviors, and duration of the wait period. Probing this interaction revealed that for children with low reported internalizing behaviors (-1 SD) and high reported effortful control (+1 SD), eye blink rate significantly decreased as they waited longer to take their turn. These findings index task-related changes in midbrain dopamine activity in relation to naturalistic task demands, and that these changes may vary as a function of individual differences in effortful control and internalizing behaviors. We discuss possible top-down mechanisms that may underlie these differences.",2024
Anxiety Change After Dopamine Therapy in Parkinson Disease is Independent of Motor Improvement.,"Several anxiety syndromes have been associated with Parkinson disease (PD), but their interactions with dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) and motor function dynamics are not completely understood. We sought to delineate how DRT impacts anxiety phenomenology in PD and whether these changes are dissociable from improved motoric function. We compared anxiety responses to DRT in two cohorts: 1) a study of 200 PD participants who completed neuropsychiatric assessments before and after taking their dopaminergic medications (""On-Off""); 2) participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) de novo PD cohort who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at the time of DRT initiation and a subsequent study visit (n = 113, mean 8-month interval). Among On-Off participants transitioning acutely to the On-state, scores on the Hamilton anxiety rating scale decreased by 37% (t = 14.8, df = 199, p <0.0001). Among PPMI participants, STAI-state scores decreased by 10.4% following DRT initiation (t = 4.5, df = 112, p <0.0001). Item-level anxiety changes exhibited weak and nonsignificant correlations (Spearman ρ: -0.24 to 0.33) with objective MDS-UPDRS motor improvements in both immediate and sustained dopamine replacement contexts. Dopamine repletion effected immediate relief of anxiety in an On-Off state comparison. A similar benefit was observed in the longitudinal PPMI cohort by comparing anxiety before and after DRT initiation, suggesting DRT confers sustained anxiolytic effects in early PD. The weak correlations between improvements to anxiety and motor function on both timescales support the view that these changes are not mediated by improved motor function.",2024
Mental stress objective screening for workers using urinary neurotransmitters.,"Almost 10% of the population develop depression or anxiety disorder during their lifetime. Considering that people who are exposed to high stress are more likely to develop mental disorders, it is important to detect and remove mental stress before depression or anxiety disorder develops. We aimed to develop an objective screening test that quantifies mental stress in workers so that they can recognize and remove it before the disorder develops. We obtained urine specimens from 100 healthy volunteers (49 men and 51 women; age = 48.2 ± 10.8 years) after they received medical checks and answered the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). Participants were divided into high- and low- stress groups according to their total BJSQ scores. We further analyzed six urinary neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, 5-hydoroxyindoleacetic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, homovanillic acid, and vanillylmandelic acid) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to compare their levels between the two groups. We obtained the concentrations of the six analytes from 100 examinees and revealed that the levels of urinary dopamine (p = 0.0042) and homovanillic acid (p = 0.020) were significantly lower in the high-stress group than those in the low-stress group. No biases were observed between the two groups in 36 laboratory items. The stress index generated from the six neurotransmitter concentrations recognized high-stress group significantly. Moreover, we discovered that the level of each urinary neurotransmitter changed depending on various stress factors, such as dissatisfaction, physical fatigue, stomach and intestine problems, poor appetite, poor working environments, sleep disturbance, isolation, worry, or insecurity. We revealed that urinary neurotransmitters could be a promising indicator to determine underlying mental stress. This study provides clues for scientists to develop a screening test not only for workers but also for patients with depression.",2023
Probing midbrain dopamine function in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder via neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing psychiatric condition, which often onsets in childhood. Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N = 135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n = 64 had an OCD diagnosis. N = 47 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p = 0.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p = 0.004, Cohen's d = 0.51) and ventral tegmental area (p = 0.006, d = 0.50). Follow-up analyses indicated that more severe lifetime symptoms (t = -2.72, p = 0.009) and longer illness duration (t = -2.22, p = 0.03) related to lower neuromelanin-MRI signal. Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p < 0.001, d = 1.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response.",2023
Gender-Related Differences in the Relationship between Homovanillic Acid in the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Clinical Symptoms in Suicide Attempters.,"Decreased dopaminergic activity - as reflected by lower levels of the major metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - may be involved in the pathophysiology of attempted suicide. An inverse association has also been found between dopaminergic activity and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety in non-suicidal individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between CSF-HVA and clinical symptoms associated with an increased risk of suicide in individuals who attempted suicide. Ninety-five people (52 women; 43 men) who had recently attempted suicide received lumbar punctures to analyse levels of HVA in the CSF. They were also evaluated with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, from which scores on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Brief Scale of Anxiety (BSA), and an item on suicidal thoughts were analysed. Among female participants, CSF-HVA was significantly and negatively correlated with BSA total scores, after adjusting for covariates (beta = -0.442, p = 0.002), but not with scores on the MADRS or suicidal thought item. No significant correlations were observed between CSF-HVA and symptoms among male participants. Our findings suggest that lower dopaminergic activity may be associated with clinical symptoms of anxiety among women who have recently attempted suicide.",2023
'Anxious fluctuators' a subgroup of Parkinson's disease with high anxiety and problematic on-off fluctuations.,"Anxiety that occurs in association with on-off dopamine medication fluctuations is a major cause of distress, dysfunction, and lower quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the association between anxiety and on-off fluctuations is poorly understood and it is difficult to predict which patients will suffer from this atypical form of anxiety. To understand whether fluctuating anxiety in PD exists as part of an endophenotype that is associated with other signs or symptoms, we prospectively assessed the change in anxiety and a battery of clinical variables when transitioning from the off-dopamine medication state to the on state in 200 people with PD. We performed latent profile analysis with observed variables as latent profile indicators measuring the on-off-state difference in anxiety, depression, motor function, daily functioning, and the wearing off questionnaire 19 item scale (WOQ-19) in order to model unobserved (i.e., latent) profiles. A two-class model produced the best fit. The majority of participants, 69%, were categorized as having a 'typical on-off response' compared to a second profile constituting 31% of the sample who experienced a worsening in anxiety in the off state that was three times that of other participants. This profile referred to as ""anxious fluctuators"" had a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale change between the off and on medication state of 10.22(32.85) compared to 3.27 (7.62), higher depression scores, greater disability and was less likely to improve on select WOQ-19 items when in the on-state. Anxious fluctuators were more likely to be male and have a family history of anxiety disorder. Given the adverse impact of this profile we believe it may be important to distinguish patients with a typical on-off response from those with this more problematic course of fluctuations.",2022
Ventral tegmental area integrity measured with high-resolution 7-Tesla MRI relates to motivation across depression and anxiety diagnoses.,"The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is one of the major sources of dopamine in the brain and has been associated with reward prediction, error-based reward learning, volitional drive and anhedonia. However, precise anatomical investigations of the VTA have been prevented by the use of standard-resolution MRI, reliance on subjective manual tracings, and lack of quantitative measures of dopamine-related signal. Here, we combine ultra-high field 400 µm<sup>3</sup> quantitative MRI with dopamine-related signal mapping, and a mixture of machine learning and supervised computational techniques to delineate the VTA in a transdiagnostic sample of subjects with and without depression and anxiety disorders. Subjects also underwent cognitive testing to measure intrinsic and extrinsic motivational tone. Fifty-one subjects were scanned in total, including healthy control (HC) and mood/anxiety (MA) disorder subjects. MA subjects had significantly larger VTA volumes compared to HC but significantly lower signal intensity within VTA compared to HC, indicating reduced structural integrity of the dopaminergic VTA. Interestingly, while VTA integrity did not significantly correlate with self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms, it was correlated with an objective cognitive measure of extrinsic motivation, whereby lower VTA integrity was associated with lower motivation. This is the first study to demonstrate a computational pipeline for detecting and delineating the VTA in human subjects with 400 μm<sup>3</sup> resolution. We highlight the use of objective transdiagnostic measures of cognitive function that link neural integrity to behavior across clinical and non-clinical groups.",2022
Midbrain dopamine neurons arbiter OCD-like behavior.,"The neurobiological understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes dysregulated frontostriatal circuitry and altered monoamine transmission. Repetitive stereotyped behavior (e.g., grooming), a featured symptom in OCD, has been proposed to be associated with perturbed dopamine (DA) signaling. However, the precise brain circuits participating in DA's control over this behavioral phenotype remain elusive. Here, we identified that DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) orchestrate ventromedial striatum (VMS) microcircuits as well as lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) during self-grooming behavior. SNc-VMS and SNc-lOFC dopaminergic projections modulate grooming behaviors and striatal microcircuit function differentially. Specifically, the activity of the SNc-VMS pathway promotes grooming via D1 receptors, whereas the activity of the SNc-lOFC pathway suppresses grooming via D2 receptors. SNc DA neuron activity thus controls the OCD-like behaviors via both striatal and cortical projections as dual gating. These results support both pharmacological and brain-stimulation treatments for OCD.",2022
Pharmacological and Physiological Correlates of the Bidirectional Fear Phenotype of the Carioca Rats and Other Bidirectionally Selected Lines.,"The Carioca rat lines originated from the selective bidirectional breeding of mates displaying extreme defense responses to contextual conditioned fear. After three generations, two distinct populations could be distinguished: the Carioca High- and Low-conditioned Freezing rats, CHF, and CLF, respectively. Later studies identified strong anxiety-like behaviors in the CHF line, while indications of impulsivity and hyperactivity were prominent in the CLF animals. The present review details the physiological and pharmacological-related findings obtained from these lines. The results discussed here point towards a dysfunctional fear circuitry in CHF rats, including alterations in key brain structures and the serotoninergic system. Moreover, data from these animals highlight important alterations in the stress-processing machinery and its associated systems, such as energy metabolism and antioxidative defense. Finally, evidence of an alteration in the dopaminergic pathway in CLF rats is also debated. Thus, accumulating data gathered over the years, place the Carioca lines as significant animal models for the study of psychiatric disorders, especially fear-related ones like anxiety.",2023
Serotonin and dopamine transporter availability in social anxiety disorder after combined treatment with escitalopram and cognitive-behavioral therapy.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) are recommended treatments of social anxiety disorder (SAD), and often combined, but their effects on monoaminergic signaling are not well understood. In this multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) study, 24 patients with SAD were randomized to treatment with escitalopram+ICBT or placebo+ICBT under double-blind conditions. Before and after 9 weeks of treatment, patients were examined with positron emission tomography and the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I, probing the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporter proteins respectively. Both treatment combinations resulted in significant improvement as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). At baseline, SERT-DAT co-expression was high and, in the putamen and thalamus, co-expression showed positive associations with symptom severity. SERT-DAT co-expression was also predictive of treatment success, but predictor-outcome associations differed in direction between the treatments. After treatment, average SERT occupancy in the SSRI + ICBT group was >80%, with positive associations between symptom improvement and occupancy in the nucleus accumbens, putamen and anterior cingulate cortex. Following placebo+ICBT, SERT binding increased in the raphe nuclei. DAT binding increased in both groups in limbic and striatal areas, but relations with symptom improvement differed, being negative for SSRI + ICBT and positive for placebo + ICBT. Thus, serotonin-dopamine transporter co-expression exerts influence on symptom severity and remission rate in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. However, the monoamine transporters are modulated in dissimilar ways when cognitive-behavioral treatment is given concomitantly with either SSRI-medication or pill placebo.",2022
Case Report: Possible autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder with postpartum onset.,"Autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is rare. The case presented here is that of a female patient in her mid-thirties who developed postpartum OCD. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple juxtacortical hyperintensities that may have been post-inflammatory in origin. In tissue-based assays using mouse brain slices, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed novel anti-nucleoli autoantibodies in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons. The CSF dopamine and glutamate concentrations were dysregulated. The clinical course and diagnostic findings were compatible with possible autoimmune OCD with postpartum onset.",2022
Effects of early life stress during stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) on anxiety and curiosity in adolescent rats.,"Repeated exposure to adverse experiences in early life, termed Early Life Stress (ELS), can increase anxiety disorders later in life. Anxiety is directly associated with curiosity, a form of intrinsic drive state associated with increased novelty-seeking behaviour and risk taking for challenging opportunities and could probably modulate learning and memory. In humans, elevated curiosity during adolescence tends to elicit increased exploration, novelty seeking, high risk-taking behaviour and heightened emotionality. Such behaviours are beneficial in maintaining social skills and cognitive functions later in life. We investigated whether ELS-induced anxiety impacts curiosity-like behaviour at adolescence in an animal model. ELS was induced by subjecting Sprague Dawley rat pups to maternal separation and isolation (MS) stress during the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) from post-natal days (PND) 4-PND 14. This rat model was tested for anxiety, spontaneous exploratory behaviour and curiosity-like behaviour in a custom-designed arena during adolescence (PND 30-45). ELS-induced changes in the stress were confirmed by corticosterone, while, basal dopamine level was estimated to understand the neurochemical basis of MS stress-induced changes in curiosity. We observed an increase in the levels of anxiety and intrinsic drive state such as curiosity-like behaviour, which was associated with elevated plasma corticosterone and dopamine in MS animals during adolescence suggesting the impact of ELS during SHRP on adolescent behaviour.",2022
Developmental impact of glutamate transporter overexpression on dopaminergic neuron activity and stereotypic behavior.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition that often begins in childhood. Genetic studies in OCD have pointed to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, with evidence suggesting that increased expression contributes to risk. In mice, midbrain Slc1a1 expression supports repetitive behavior in response to dopaminergic agonists, aligning with neuroimaging and pharmacologic challenge studies that have implicated the dopaminergic system in OCD. These findings suggest that Slc1a1 may contribute to compulsive behavior through altered dopaminergic transmission; however, this theory has not been mechanistically tested. To examine the developmental impact of Slc1a1 overexpression on compulsive-like behaviors, we, therefore, generated a novel mouse model to perform targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in dopaminergic neurons. Mice with life-long overexpression of Slc1a1 showed a significant increase in amphetamine (AMPH)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that Slc1a1 overexpression was associated with increased firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dLight1.1 fiber photometry showed that these behavioral abnormalities were associated with increased dorsal striatum dopamine release. In contrast, no impact of overexpression was observed on anxiety-like behaviors or SKF-38393-induced grooming. Importantly, overexpression solely in adulthood failed to recapitulate these behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that overexpression during development is necessary to generate AMPH-induced phenotypes. However, doxycycline-induced reversal of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression in adulthood normalized both the increased dopaminergic firing and AMPH-induced responses. These data indicate that the pathologic effects of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression on dopaminergic neurotransmission and AMPH-induced stereotyped behavior are developmentally mediated, and support normalization of EAAT3 activity as a potential treatment target for basal ganglia-mediated repetitive behaviors.",2022
Comprehensive exploration of the genetic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways to psychiatric disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent and display considerable clinical and genetic overlap. Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission have been shown to play an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Here we aim to assess the genetic contribution of these systems to eight psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (ANO), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and Tourette's syndrome (TS)) using publicly available GWAS analyses performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium that include more than 160,000 cases and 275,000 controls. To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic examination of genes encoding proteins essential to the function of these two neurotransmitter systems in these disorders. Our results support a pleiotropic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in several psychiatric conditions.",2022
Expectancy effects on serotonin and dopamine transporters during SSRI treatment of social anxiety disorder: a randomized clinical trial.,"It has been extensively debated whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more efficacious than placebo in affective disorders, and it is not fully understood how SSRIs exert their beneficial effects. Along with serotonin transporter blockade, altered dopamine signaling and psychological factors may contribute. In this randomized clinical trial of participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) we investigated how manipulation of verbally-induced expectancies, vital for placebo response, affect brain monoamine transporters and symptom improvement during SSRI treatment. Twenty-seven participants with SAD (17 men, 10 women), were randomized, to 9 weeks of overt or covert treatment with escitalopram 20 mg. The overt group received correct treatment information whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with escitalopram, described as an active placebo in a cover story. Before and after treatment, patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) assessments with the [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I radiotracers, probing brain serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporters. SAD symptoms were measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Overt was superior to covert SSRI treatment, resulting in almost a fourfold higher rate of responders. PET results showed that SERT occupancy after treatment was unrelated to anxiety reduction and equally high in both groups. In contrast, DAT binding decreased in the right putamen, pallidum, and the left thalamus with overt SSRI treatment, and increased with covert treatment, resulting in significant group differences. DAT binding potential changes in these regions correlated negatively with symptom improvement. Findings support that the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs involve psychological factors contingent on dopaminergic neurotransmission while serotonin transporter blockade alone is insufficient for clinical response.",2021
Dorsal striatal dopamine induces fronto-cortical hypoactivity and attenuates anxiety and compulsive behaviors in rats.,"Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",2022
"Altering the development of the dopaminergic system through social play in rats: Implications for anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and compulsivity.","Dopamine is essential to many functions like reward, motivation, and attention; when its neural pathways do not function properly, various disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, compulsions) can arise. Truncated-DAT rats display persistent stereotypies and aggressiveness; hence they are a new valuable animal model to study the pathogenesis of these disorders. The focus of research is often on the individual epigenetic determinants and much less on the impact of social experiences. Here, we investigate the developmental impact of the social environment on adolescent wild type (WT) rats. We divided subjects at weaning into three groups: living with another adolescent (WT Peer), with a WT adult, or with a truncated-DAT one, and we observed homecage social behavior of these pairs (play, jump, victory, and ""bullying"") during whole adolescence. When adult, we observed the same subjects in plus maze, forced swim, and social preference tests to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and quality of social interactions. Compared to the other groups, WT rats that had spent their adolescence with a truncated-DAT adult as companion show more anxious, depressive, hyperactive, impulsive, and compulsive behaviours. Results confirm that social interactions and healthy play (i.e., when play has behavioural, social, and psychomotor rewards that support the cognitive, emotional and physical development of the individual) are essential to neurobehavioral maturation. Conversely, anomalous interactions like poor play and ""bullying"" in developing rats may impact onto their dopaminergic system. Consequently, an impoverished social play could be one of the factors contributing to the appearance of putative indexes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and\or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",2021
Disruption of prepulse inhibition is associated with compulsive behavior severity and nucleus accumbens dopamine receptor changes in Sapap3 knockout mice.,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with disruption of sensorimotor gating, which may contribute to difficulties inhibiting intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals. Neural mechanisms underlying these disturbances are unclear; however, striatal dopamine is implicated in regulation of sensorimotor gating and OCD pathophysiology. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between sensorimotor gating, compulsive behavior, and striatal dopamine receptor levels in Sapap3 knockout mice (KOs), a widely used preclinical model system for OCD research. We found a trend for disruption of sensorimotor gating in Sapap3-KOs using the translational measure prepulse inhibition (PPI); however, there was significant heterogeneity in both PPI and compulsive grooming in KOs. Disruption of PPI was significantly correlated with a more severe compulsive phenotype. In addition, PPI disruption and compulsive grooming severity were associated with reduced dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC). Compulsive grooming progressively worsened in Sapap3-KOs tested longitudinally, but PPI disruption was first detected in high-grooming KOs at 7 months of age. Through detailed characterization of individual differences in OCD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical measures, our findings suggest that NAcC dopamine receptor changes may be involved in disruption of sensorimotor gating and compulsive behavior relevant to OCD.",2021
Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD.,"Effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments are well established for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are first-line treatment and are of benefit to about half of patients. Augmentation of SRI treatment with low-dose neuroleptics is an evidence-based second-line strategy. Specialty psychotherapy is also used as both first-line and second-line treatment and can benefit many. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to these treatments. New alternatives are urgently needed. This review summarizes evidence for these established pharmacotherapeutic strategies, and for others that have been investigated in refractory disease but are not supported by the same level of evidence. We focus on three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We summarize evidence from genetic, neuroimaging, animal model, and other lines of investigation that probe these three systems in patients with OCD. We also review recent work on predictors of response to current treatments. While many studies suggest abnormalities that may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, most studies have been small, and non-replication of reported findings has been common. Nevertheless, the gradual accrual of evidence for neurotransmitter dysregulation may in time lead the way to new pharmacological strategies.",2021
The Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders and Parkinson's Disease: Clinical and Therapeutic Issues.,"This paper seeks to describe anxiety's different symptomatologic presentations in Parkinson's disease (PD), its longitudinal course and predictors, as well as its motor and non-motor correlates. It also reviews the available screening tools and different treatment modalities. In PD, longitudinal predictors of anxiety are mostly non-motor non-dopaminergic symptoms. The longitudinal course of anxiety is mainly a stable one. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Scale are the 2 recommended screening tools. A third of PD patients suffer from an anxiety disorder at any time point. It can precede or follow PD motor symptoms. Anxiety is associated with demographic, disease-related motor and non-motor features. There is a lack of studies evaluating psychotropic treatment of anxiety in PD. Adjustment of dopaminergic treatment is indicated when anxiety is associated with motor fluctuations. DBS can be useful as well as CBT and body-mind interventions.",2021
Dissociable dopaminergic and pavlovian influences in goal-trackers and sign-trackers on a model of compulsive checking in OCD.,"Checking is a functional behaviour that provides information to guide behaviour. However, in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), checking may escalate to dysfunctional levels. The processes underpinning the transition from functional to dysfunctional checking are unclear but may be associated with individual differences that support the development of maladaptive behaviour. We examined one such predisposition, sign-tracking to a pavlovian conditioned stimulus, which we previously found associated with dysfunctional checking. How sign-tracking interacts with another treatment with emerging translational validity for OCD-like checking, chronic administration of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist quinpirole, is unknown. We tested how functional and dysfunctional checking in the rat observing response task (ORT) was affected by chronic quinpirole administration in non-autoshaped controls and autoshaped animals classified as sign-trackers or goal-trackers. Sign-trackers or goal-trackers were trained on the ORT before the effects of chronic quinpirole administration on checking were assessed. Subsequently, the effects on checking of different behavioural challenges, including reward omission and the use of unpredictable reinforcement schedules, were tested. Prior autoshaping increased checking. Sign-trackers and goal-trackers responded differently to quinpirole sensitization, reward omission and reinforcement uncertainty. Sign-trackers showed greater elevations in dysfunctional checking, particularly during uncertainty. By contrast, goal-trackers predominantly increased functional checking responses, possibly in response to reduced discrimination accuracy in the absence of cues signalling which lever was currently active. The results are discussed in terms of how pavlovian associations influence behaviour that becomes compulsive in OCD and how this may be dependent on striatal dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors.",2020
Biological and Clinical Markers to Differentiate the Type of Anxiety Disorders.,"The present chapter is an overview of possible biomarkers which distinguish anxiety disorders as classified by the DSM-5. Structural or activity changes in the brain regions; changes in N-acetylaspartate/creatine, dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin; hearth rate variability; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity; error-related negativity; respiratory regulation; and genetic variants are proposed. However, their clinical utility is questionable due to low specificity and sensitivity: the majority does not distinguish subjects with different anxiety disorders, and they might be influenced by stress, comorbidity, physical activity, and psychotropic medications. In this framework, the staging model, a clinimetric tool which allows to define the degree of progression of a disease at a point in time and where the patient is located on the continuum of the course of the disease, is proposed since several DSM anxiety disorders take place at different stages of the same syndrome according to the staging model. Thus, a stage-specific biomarker model for anxiety disorders is hypothesized and illustrated.",2020
Expression and co-expression of serotonin and dopamine transporters in social anxiety disorder: a multitracer positron emission tomography study.,"Serotonin and dopamine are putatively involved in the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders, but positron emission tomography (PET) studies probing the two neurotransmitters in the same individuals are lacking. The aim of this multitracer PET study was to evaluate the regional expression and co-expression of the transporter proteins for serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Voxel-wise binding potentials (BP<sub>ND</sub>) for SERT and DAT were determined in 27 patients with SAD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, using the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB (3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile) and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I (N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)nortropane). Results showed that, within transmitter systems, SAD patients exhibited higher SERT binding in the nucleus accumbens while DAT availability in the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen correlated positively with symptom severity. At a more lenient statistical threshold, SERT and DAT BP<sub>ND</sub> were also higher in other striatal and limbic regions in patients, and correlated with symptom severity, whereas no brain region showed higher binding in healthy controls. Moreover, SERT/DAT co-expression was significantly higher in SAD patients in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and posterior ventral thalamus, while lower co-expression was noted in the dorsomedial thalamus. Follow-up logistic regression analysis confirmed that SAD diagnosis was significantly predicted by the statistical interaction between SERT and DAT availability, in the amygdala, putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Thus, SAD was associated with mainly increased expression and co-expression of the transporters for serotonin and dopamine in fear and reward-related brain regions. Resultant monoamine dysregulation may underlie SAD symptomatology and constitute a target for treatment.",2021
Experiencing neonatal maternal separation increased the seizure threshold in adult male mice: Involvement of the opioid system.,"Experiencing early-life stress has been considered as a potent risk factor for the development of many of brain disorders, including seizures. Intervening mechanisms through which neonatal maternal separation (MS) alters the seizure susceptibility in adulthood have not been well studied. In the current study, by applying 180 min of MS stress (PND 2-14), we determined the seizure susceptibility and considered the role of the opioid system. Maternal separation increased the seizure threshold, and administration of anticonvulsant/proconvulsant doses of morphine (1 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) reversed the impact of MS. Using tail flick and hot plate tests, we exposed animals to 30 min Restraint stress (RS) and found that MS decreased the pain threshold, suggesting the hyporesponsiveness of the opioid system. These results supported the abnormal seizure activity observed in the MS mice and suggested that abnormalities in the opioid system following MS alter seizure susceptibility in later life.",2015
Understanding mechanisms and documenting plausibility of palliative interventions for dyspnea.,"To review the mechanisms for the perception of dyspnea and to consider the plausibility of interventions that palliate dyspnea after optimal treatment of the underlying disease. Activation of sensory receptors by blood gas abnormalities, mechanical respiratory loads, and hyperinflation provides afferent information to the central nervous system for integration and processing. It has been proposed that a discriminative pathway processes afferent impulses to the somatosensory cortex that reflects the intensity of dyspnea, whereas an affective pathway projects afferent impulses to structures of the limbic system that reflects the unpleasantness of dyspnea. In one study, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reported consistently higher ratings of breathlessness after administration of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, compared with physiological saline during high-intensity treadmill exercise. This finding supports the role of endogenous opioids in modulating dyspnea. Nebulized furosemide, anti-inflammatory therapy, and chest wall vibration are potential approaches for modulating lung and chest wall receptors to relieve dyspnea. Targets for palliating dyspnea in patients with advanced disease include sensory receptors within the lung/chest wall and the central nervous system. The opioid system plays an important role in palliating dyspnea. Both endogenous (β-endorphins) and exogenous (morphine) opioids modulate breathlessness.",2011
[Effect of physical activity on anxiety and depression].,"The advantages of physical activity are widely recognised from both a physiological and a psychological perspective. Evidence seems to demonstrate that physical activity is associated with decreases in depression and anxiety in clinical and non-clinical populations. There are a number of physiological, biochemical and psychological explanations which should be considered to understand the psychological effects of exercise. Physical activity may be considered as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments of depression and anxiety. Physical activity appears to be a non-specific form of treatment with psychotherapeutic potential that should not be ignored.",2009
Hyper-anxiety in early sobriety: psychopharmacological treatment strategies.,"The importance of recognizing and treating anxiety disorders that co-occur with alcohol use disorders should not be underestimated, whether the anxiety is state (a transient condition) or trait (a chronic disorder). This article will discuss hyper-anxiety, a term the authors use to describe the uncomfortable, excessively anxious state that contributes to relapse. In addition, psychopharmacological strategies for relief of hyper-anxiety are suggested, and implications for recovery are discussed.",2006
Stereotypies and behavioural medicine: confusions in current thinking.,"Stereotypies are defined as being repetitive, unvarying behaviours that appear to have no goal or function. This group of behaviours presents itself commonly in clinical behavioural practice. In recent companion animal behaviour literature the nomenclature has been changed to obsessive-compulsive disorder without considering the confusion this may create. Theories about the role endorphins play as a cause of stereotypies and an assumption about stereotypies playing a 'coping' role have been presented as scientific fact with little evidence supporting them. A failure to consider changes associated with stereotypy maturation and a reliance on anecdotal treatment success has lead to confusion regarding certain aspects of the development, diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. In this paper I present the idea that much of our confusion surrounding stereotypies is created by attempts to oversimplify a complex phenomenon.",2003
[Humoral factors (beta-endorphin and adrenocorticotropin) in irritable bowel syndrome and their relations with psychological disorders and characteristics of disorders in the large intestine motility].,"The object of this study was to discover mental functions, humoral regulation and large intestinal motor dysfunction in patients with the irritable bowels syndrome (IBS) in order to develop principles of their differential correction. A group of 106 patients (26 men and 80 women) with the irritable bowels syndrome was examined. The IBS diagnosis was made in accordance with the Rome criteria (1999). The control group included 21 somatically healthy volunteers (16 women and 5 men). Patients from both of the groups underwent clinical and psychological as well as plasma beta-endorphin concentration studies; colonic motor activity was also studied in patients with the IBS by the method of electric colonoscopy. Mental changes and certain particular features of the large intestine humoral regulation and motor activity determining the differential treatment for this category of patients were discovered.",2003
[A control study of personality characteristics and variation of plasma peptide in pilots with neurosis].,"Objective. To study the relationship between personality type and variation of plasma peptides in pilots with neurosis. Method. A case-control study was used. 124 male pilots were evaluated with Eysenck's personality checklist, and then level of certain plasma peptides, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and angiotensin-II (A-II) were determined. Result. There were significant difference in personality characteristics and personality types between pilots with neuroses and the control. The contents of VIP and beta-EP in plasma showed visible difference between disease group and control. Content of beta-EP in those with inner-unstable type personality was lowest among all the various types. Conclusion. Personality characteristics were different between pilots with neurosis and controls. Levels of VIP and beta-EP in disease group were lower than those in the control. Different personality types had different levels of beta-EP in pilots with neurosis.",2001

Tickling induces reward in adolescent rats.,"In adolescent rats, 50-kHz vocalizations are most evident during tickling and rough-and-tumble play. The following experiments evaluated whether 50-kHz vocalizations reflect positive social affect by determining (1) if tickling is a rewarding event, (2) if social or isolate housing conditions differentially influence the response (since housing condition has been found to effect the reward magnitude of social encounters), and (3) if drugs that work on mu-opiate receptors, which has been hypothesized to control positive social affect, modulate tickling. Tickling was positively reinforcing as demonstrated by elevated operant behavior, conditioned place preference, and approach measures. A significant negative correlation between vocalization rate and approach latency measures was found. Social housing reduced tickle-induced vocalizations and approach speeds compared to isolate housing. Naloxone (1 mg/kg) increased vocalization in the socially housed rats and decreased it in isolated Subjects (Ss). These findings suggest that tickling can be used to induce positive social affect in rodents, and that it is modulated by endogenous opioids.",2001
Neuroendocrine responses to psychological stress in adolescents with anxiety disorder.,"Neurotransmitter-neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses to the administration of a psychologically stressful mixed-model test (Mental Arithmetic, Stroop Color Word Interference Task, Trier Social Stress Test) were examined in 20 male peripubertal subjects affected by anxiety disorder (group A: 14 with generalized anxiety disorder, 6 with generalized anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder) and 20 junior school adolescents, matched for age, without overt psychological disorders (group B). Plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin (beta-EP), cortisol (CORT), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and testosterone (Te) were measured immediately before the beginning of the tests and 30 min later at their end. Mean prestress values of GH, PRL, beta-EP and ACTH were significantly higher in anxious subjects than in controls. There was no difference in NE, EPI, CORT and Te prestress levels in the two groups. After the psychological stress session NE, GH and Te concentrations increased significantly in anxious subjects (A), but not in controls. In contrast, beta-EP and PRL decreased significantly during the psychological stress session in anxious subjects, and were unaffected by stress in the subjects without anxiety. No significant changes were found in ACTH, CORT and EPI during the challenge either in anxious subjects or in controls, which may be attributed to the late time of poststress blood sampling. In contrast to controls, heart rate and systolic blood pressure increased significantly in anxious subjects after psychological stress testing. Our data support the hypothesis that the hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system in response to stress is associated with anxiety disorders in adolescents and might influence the responses of GH and Te. High prestress basal values of stress hormones seem to be induced in anxious subjects by the anticipation of the task or by a persistent hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system. Further studies are needed to investigate in more detail the involvement of the HPA axis in anxious adolescents by a more refined resolution of time points of blood sampling.",2000
No evidence for opioid-mediated analgesia induced by phobic fear.,"The influence of anxiety on acute pain sensation was investigated, studying the relative contribution of endogenous opioids and attentional mechanisms. Thirty-six spider phobics received mildly painful electrical stimulation, while anxiety and focus of attention were manipulated within subjects. The opioid antagonist naloxone or placebo was administered between subjects to examine an analgesia owing to anxiety-induced endorphinergic activity. In contrast to earlier findings, attention towards pain failed to increase pain as opposed to distraction from pain, probably owing to a less effective attention manipulation. Furthermore, despite high levels of anxiety, subjective pain ratings were not influenced by anxiety, although heart rate responses were slightly inhibited. Accordingly, there was no increase in subjective or physiological pain responses as a result of naloxone, nor did beta-endorphin plasma levels rise during anxiety. The results suggest that phobic anxiety does not induce an opioid-mediated analgesia. Curiously, naloxone itself effected a dose-dependent analgesia compared to placebo during both high and low anxiety, which is compatible with the assumption of agonist properties of naloxone in the absence of opioid activity.",1997
Anxiety and pain: attentional and endorphinergic influences.,"The role of attentional mechanisms and endogenous opioids in the influence of anxiety on acute pain sensation was investigated. Forty-five spider phobics received mildly painful electrical stimulation. The opioid antagonist naltrexone or placebo was administered between subjects to examine an analgesia due to anxiety-induced endorphinergic activity, while anxiety and focus of attention were manipulated within subjects. In accordance with previous research, pain ratings and skin conductance responses (SCRs) were not influenced by anxiety when focus of attention was controlled for. Attention towards pain led to an increase in subjective pain as opposed to distraction from pain. SCRs, however, were increased in the distraction conditions, probably due to heightened unexpectedness. Further, both high and low anxiety resulted in an analgesia compared to the pretest in the placebo condition, which was reversed by a low dose of naltrexone, but not by a high dose. Apart from possible agonist properties of high doses of naltrexone, this effect suggests an opioid-induced analgesia. It remains to be demonstrated whether this was due to endogenous opioids released during high anxiety.",1996
Pentagastrin induced panic attacks: enhanced sensitivity in panic disorder patients.,"The effects of pentagastrin, a synthetic analogue of the cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK4), were studied in 15 patients with panic disorder and 15 healthy controls. Three different intravenous dosages of pentagastrin (0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 microgram/kg) and saline were investigated. Subjects were randomly allocated to two of the four treatment groups and tested on two separate occasions, 1 week apart, using an unbalanced double-blind incomplete block design. The mean panic rate with pentagastrin was 55% (12/22) for patients and 5% (1/22) for controls. None of the subjects panicked with saline. The frequency of panic attacks between the three pentagastrin doses in patients was not different. One control subject had a panic-like attack at the highest dose of pentagastrin. These findings concur with previous studies on the panicogenic effect of CCK4 and pentagastrin and suggest a greater sensitivity for CCK receptor agonists in patients suffering from panic disorder than in healthy controls.",1994
Testing the suffocation false alarm theory of panic disorder.,"The need for hypotheses concerning the nature of those functions that have been impaired in stereotyped psychiatric syndromes is emphasized. With regard to panic disorder, the key role of the spontaneous panic attack became apparent from several viewpoints. However, panics seem to be a type of misreleased fear, which guided the thinking concerning the nature of possible psychological or physiological malfunctions. We indicate that spontaneous panic cannot be fear, but must represent some other malfunction and suggest that the spontaneous panic is a suffocation false alarm. The development of this idea is outlined, and attempts to develop tests of this hypothesis are indicated. In particular, studies of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, dyspnea, field measures of panic, pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, as well as the premenstrual syndrome afford pointed opportunities, new information and potential tests of the theory. A recent challenge to the theory from acetazolamide infusion is discussed. Developing a possible antecedent for the pathologically depressed threshold for the suffocation alarm, in the form of a phasic endorphinergic deficiency, is presented.",1994
Opioid antagonist affects behavioral effects of exposure in vivo.,"This study tested the hypothesis that endogenous opioids are involved in the extinction of phobic fear through exposure in vivo. Forty-eight spider phobics participated in a 2-hr therapist-directed exposure in vivo treatment. Sixteen Ss were assigned to placebo, 16 to a low dose of naltrexone, and 16 to a high dose of naltrexone. Before intervention, after treatment, and at a 1-wk follow-up test, self-report, physiological, and behavioral measures of phobic fear were completed. At 1-wk follow-up, naltrexone was significantly related, in a dose-dependent way, to a greater relapse on avoidance measures but not on emotional, cognitive, and physiological measures. Endogenous opioids may be specifically involved in the extinction of avoidance behavior but not in the extinction of all aspects of phobic fear.",1993
"Endorphins stimulate approach behaviour, but do not reduce subjective fear. A pilot study.","The present study explored whether endorphins have a short-term influence on behavioural approach to a phobic object and on the experience of fear. In a double-blind design, spider phobics (n = 30) received a placebo, a low dose (25 mg) or a high dose (100 mg) of naltrexone, an endorphin blocker. Approach to a spider appeared to be negatively influenced by the endorphin blocker, but subjective fear was not significantly related to it. The findings support the view that endorphin release during anxiety stimulates courageous behaviour, but does not directly reduce the experience of fear.",1993
Association of beta-endorphin with specific clinical symptoms of depression.,"Abnormalities in plasma concentrations of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-endorphin) have been reported in depressed patients. This study was done to test the hypothesis that specific clinical characteristics of depression are associated with plasma beta-endorphin concentration. Plasma beta-endorphin was evaluated in 20 depressed patients diagnosed according to DSM-III-R and in 23 age- and sex-matched comparison subjects, and each was evaluated with the structured Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS). Twelve SADS items involving dysphoric mood and related symptoms were chosen for analysis. Within the group of all 43 subjects and within the depressed group, beta-endorphin level correlated significantly with psychic anxiety and with phobia. In the depressed group only, beta-endorphin also correlated significantly with obsessions/compulsions. Concentration of beta-endorphin was not significantly correlated with score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or Beck Depression Inventory or with scores on other SADS symptom items, including somatic anxiety, insomnia, subjective anger, overt anger, agitation, psychomotor retardation, panic attacks, appetite loss, or total weight loss. In the group of 23 comparison subjects, beta-endorphin did not correlate with Beck or Hamilton depression score or with any of the SADS clinical variables. High levels of plasma beta-endorphin may be associated with more severe anxiety, phobia, and obsessions/compulsions in depressed patients.",1992
[Plasma neuropeptides in affective and anxiety disorders].,"The levels of Neurotensin, VIP, Somatostatin, beta-endorphin and Bombesin have been investigated in plasma of 16 depressed and 20 anxious patients. VIP and Neurotensin were found significantly decreased in patients vs a group of 20 controls. Neurotensin levels returned to normal values after recovery. There were no significant differences from the normal in the concentrations of Somatostatin, beta-endorphin and Bombesin in the disease groups.",1992
Psychoimmunoendocrine aspects of panic disorder.,"Immunological, neuroendocrine and psychological parameters were examined in 14 psychophysically healthy subjects and in 17 panic disorder patients before and after a 30-day course of alprazolam therapy. T lymphocyte proliferation in response to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin, lymphocyte beta-endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations, plasma ACTH, cortisol and beta-EP levels were examined in basal conditions and after corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Cortisol inhibition by dexamethasone (DST) and basal growth hormone (GH) and prolactin levels were also examined. Depression, state or trait anxiety, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, simple and social phobias, severity and frequency of panic attacks were monitored by rating scales. The immune study did not reveal any significant difference between patients and controls, or any effect of alprazolam therapy. The hormonal data for the two groups were similar, except for higher than normal basal ACTH and GH plasma levels, lower than normal ratios between the ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH, and blunted DST in some patients. All the impairments improved after alprazolam therapy, in parallel with decreases in anxiety and in severity and frequency of panic attacks.",1992

Opioid antagonist impedes exposure.,"Exposure is a rapid and effective treatment for simple phobias. This study tested the assumption that endorphin release may be involved in exposure to a feared situation. Thirty spider-phobic Ss underwent exposure to 17 phobic-related, graded performance tasks. Half the Ss were randomly assigned to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, and half to a placebo. Measures of heart rate, blood pressure, self-efficacy, anxiety, and cognitions were obtained during treatment. Six of the 15 Ss in the naltrexone group dropped out after the 10th step in the treatment compared with 1 of the 15 Ss in the placebo group, chi 2(1, N = 30) = 4.7, p = .03. The naltrexone group took significantly longer to complete the first 10 steps (the last step that included all Ss) compared with the placebo group, F(9, 252) = 2.17, p = .024. Maximum heart rate and anxiety were significantly greater at Step 10 in the naltrexone group, but no differences were found for self-efficacy or cognitions. The study provides further evidence that the endogenous opioid system may be involved in the process of exposure.",1991
"Immunoreactive beta-endorphin, cortisol, and growth hormone plasma levels in obsessive-compulsive disorder.","Basal morning plasma levels of immunoreactive-beta-endorphin (ir-beta-EP), cortisol, and growth hormone (GH) were assessed in 13 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients in comparison to 20 healthy controls. All subjects were drug free for at least 1 year. The mean plasma level of ir-beta-EP was significantly lower (36%) in the OCD patients when compared with the control subjects. The decrease in ir-beta-EP was not accompanied by alteration in cortisol and GH plasma levels.",1990
"[Opioid peptides in the dynamics of ""physiological"" and ""pathological"" stress].","Clinical studies showed that short-term ""physiological"" stress (bicycle ergometry) did not cause increase of the blood plasma enkephalin content. Moderate-term (60-minute) stress, according to O. Desiderato, causes a rise of the blood enkephalin level in rats. It is supposed that such a reaction of the opioid system is characteristic of borderline conditions between normal and pathological states in stress. Severe ""pathological"" stress (myocardial infarction, experimental coronary occlusion, 6-hour stress after O. Desiderato) in rats led to a decrease of the concentration of enkephalins in the blood and disorders of their secretion and storage in the adrenals. It is suggested that changes of the activity of the opioid system are a predictor of the transition of a ""physiological"" stress to a ""pathological"" stress.",1990
A cerebrospinal fluid study of the pathophysiology of panic disorder associated with alcoholism.,"In order to investigate the neurochemistry of panic disorder in alcoholics, we measured various cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters in subjects with both conditions and compared them with an age- and sex-matched population of alcoholics and normal controls. When height, age and weight were covaried, subjects with panic disorder had higher levels of B-endorphin in CSF. There were no differences in other CSF measures between the groups. Alcoholics with panic disorder had higher plasma MHPG concentrations compared with alcoholics without panic disorder but these were not statistically different from controls.",1990
"Behavioral, neuroendocrine, and biochemical effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan administration in panic disorder.","L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) was administered to 20 patients suffering from panic disorder and to 20 healthy controls. Subjects received 60 mg 5HTP in 300 ml saline solution. Before, during, and up to 2 hours after 5HTP administration, symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed. In addition, plasma 5HTP, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyethylglycol (MHPG), cortisol, beta-endorphin, and melatonin levels were measured at several time points, and the kinetics of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) in blood platelets were measured. During and after the infusion of 5HTP, none of the patients showed an increase in anxiety or depressive symptoms, despite the presence of severe side effects. Some patients even experienced the 5HTP infusion as a relief. In contrast to the patients, nine control subjects reported depressed mood, although no increases in anxiety were noted. In both patients and controls, the 5HTP infusion led to substantial increases in plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin levels, while the plasma MHPG level was unchanged. Plasma melatonin increased significantly after 5HTP administration, suggesting that increasing 5HT availability in man might affect melatonin synthesis. The results of this study are at odds with the hypothesis that there is a supersensitivity of 5HT2 receptors in panic disorder.",1990
Altered glutamate concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with resting-state functional connectivity in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",2025
Anti-panic effect of fluoxetine during late diestrus in female rats is mediated through GABAergic mechanisms in the dorsal periaqueductal gray.,"Panic disorder is more frequent in women than in men. In women, vulnerability to panic is enhanced during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. At this time secretion of progesterone and its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO), which acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the actions of GABA at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, decline sharply. In female rats, responsiveness to a hypoxic panicogenic challenge increases during the late diestrus (LD) phase as ALLO concentration in the brain falls. During LD, short-term treatment with fluoxetine at a low dose (1.75 mg/kg i.p.) blocked panic-related escape behavior in response to hypoxia. At this dose fluoxetine increases brain concentration of ALLO without affecting 5-HT levels, thereby stabilizing brain ALLO concentration. We here report that the panicolytic-like effect of fluoxetine during LD is prevented by microinjection of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline (5 pmol) into the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), a key panic-related area. This result suggests that fluoxetine's effect is indirectly mediated via a GABAergic mechanism in the dPAG and highlights the important role of changes in GABAergic tone in regulating neuronal excitability in the panic circuitry during the estrous cycle. It also points to the potential for using short-term, low dose fluoxetine as an anti-panic medication in women.",2025
GABAergic implications in anxiety and related disorders.,"Evidence indicates that anxiety disorders arise from an imbalance in the functioning of brain circuits that govern the modulation of emotional responses to possibly threatening stimuli. The circuits under consideration in this context include the amygdala's bottom-up activity, which signifies the existence of stimuli that may be seen as dangerous. Moreover, these circuits encompass top-down regulatory processes that originate in the prefrontal cortex, facilitating the communication of the emotional significance associated with the inputs. Diverse databases (e.g., Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar) were searched for literature using a combination of different terms e.g., ""anxiety"", ""stress"", ""neuroanatomy"", and ""neural circuits"", etc. A decrease in GABAergic activity is present in both anxiety disorders and severe depression. Research on cerebral functional imaging in depressive individuals has shown reduced levels of GABA within the cortical regions. Additionally, animal studies demonstrated that a reduction in the expression of GABA<sub>A/B</sub> receptors results in a behavioral pattern resembling anxiety. The amygdala consists of inhibitory networks composed of GABAergic interneurons, responsible for modulating anxiety responses in both normal and pathological conditions. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor has allosteric sites (e.g., α/γ, γ/β, and α/β) which enable regulation of neuronal inhibition in the amygdala. These sites serve as molecular targets for anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepine and barbiturates. Alterations in the levels of naturally occurring regulators of these allosteric sites, along with alterations to the composition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, could potentially act as mechanisms via which the extent of neuronal inhibition is diminished in pathological anxiety disorders.",2024
The relationship between oxidative stress markers and 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in obsessive compulsive disorder.,"The purpose of this study was to examine N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid complex (Glx)/Cr levels in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy controls' orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) method and to investigate their relationship with oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This study included patients with OCD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) ranging in age from 18 to 65. We used the ELISA method to evaluate serum SOD and GPx levels. Levels of NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus were measured using the 1H-MRS method. Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3 T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",2024
Microglia govern the extinction of acute stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in male mice.,"Anxiety-associated symptoms following acute stress usually become extinct gradually within a period of time. However, the mechanisms underlying how individuals cope with stress to achieve the extinction of anxiety are not clear. Here we show that acute restraint stress causes an increase in the activity of GABAergic neurons in the CeA (GABA<sup>CeA</sup>) in male mice, resulting in anxiety-like behaviors within 12 hours; meanwhile, elevated GABA<sup>CeA</sup> neuronal CX3CL1 secretion via MST4 (mammalian sterile-20-like kinase 4)-NF-κB-CX3CL1 signaling consequently activates microglia in the CeA. Activated microglia in turn inhibit GABA<sup>CeA</sup> neuronal activity via the engulfment of their dendritic spines, ultimately leading to the extinction of anxiety-like behaviors induced by restraint stress. These findings reveal a dynamic molecular and cellular mechanism in which microglia drive a negative feedback to inhibit GABA<sup>CeA</sup> neuronal activity, thus facilitating maintenance of brain homeostasis in response to acute stress.",2024

DOUBLE EFFECT OF PREGABALIN ON ANXIETY AND DYSLIPIDEMIA.,,2023
Glutamatergic abnormalities in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy: A controlled study.,"In this study, we utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to understand the role of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of OCD patients in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). In total, 54 patients with OCD and 54 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex were included in the study. They underwent MRS in the pgACC region to calculate the concentrations of Glu, Gln, GABA, and Glu + Gln (Glx). After quality control of the MRS data, 21 OCD and 21 HC were statistically analyzed. The severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale. The results indicate that patients with OCD present a disturbance in glutamatergic metabolism in the pgACC. The results also demonstrate that these changes correlate with the severity of compulsions.",2023
Postnatal Overfeeding in Rodents Induces a Neurodevelopment Delay and Anxious-like Behaviour Accompanied by Sex- and Brain-Region-Specific Synaptic and Metabolic Changes.,"Nutritional disturbances during the early postnatal period can have long-lasting effects on neurodevelopment and may be related to behavioural changes at adulthood. While such neuronal connection disruption can contribute to social and behaviour alterations, the dysregulation of the neuroendocrine pathways involved in nutrient-sensing balance may also cause such impairments, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We aimed to evaluate sex-specific neurodevelopmental and behavioural changes upon postnatal overfeeding and determine the potential underpinning mechanisms at the central nervous system level, with a focus on the interconnection between synaptic and neuroendocrine molecular alterations. At postnatal day 3 (PND3) litters were culled to three animals (small litter procedure). Neurodevelopmental tests were conducted at infancy, whereas behavioural tests to assess locomotion, anxiety, and memory were performed at adolescence, together with molecular analysis of the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex. At infancy, females presented impaired acquisition of an auditory response, eye opening, olfactory discrimination, and vestibular system development, suggesting that female offspring neurodevelopment/maturation was deeply affected. Male offspring presented a transitory delay in locomotor performance., while both offspring had lower upper limb strength. At adolescence, both sexes presented anxious-like behaviour without alterations in short-term memory retention. Both males and females presented lower NPY1R levels in a region-specific manner. Furthermore, both sexes presented synaptic changes in the hippocampus (lower GABA<sub>A</sub> in females and higher GABA<sub>A</sub> levels in males), while, in the prefrontal cortex, similar higher GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor levels were observed. At the hypothalamus, females presented synaptic changes, namely higher vGLUT1 and PSD95 levels. Thus, we demonstrate that postnatal overfeeding modulates offspring behaviour and dysregulates nutrient-sensing mechanisms such as NPY and GABA in a sex- and brain-region-specific manner.",2023
Cortical glutamate and GABA are related to compulsive behaviour in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and healthy controls.,"There has been little analysis of neurochemical correlates of compulsive behaviour to illuminate its underlying neural mechanisms. We use 7-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to assess the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by measuring glutamate and GABA levels in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) of healthy volunteers and participants with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Within the SMA, trait and clinical measures of compulsive behaviour are related to glutamate levels, whereas a behavioural index of habitual control correlates with the glutamate:GABA ratio. Participants with OCD also show the latter relationship in the ACC while exhibiting elevated glutamate and lower GABA levels in that region. This study highlights SMA mechanisms of habitual control relevant to compulsive behaviour, common to the healthy sub-clinical and OCD populations. The results also demonstrate additional involvement of anterior cingulate in the balance between goal-directed and habitual responding in OCD.",2023
Sex differences in anxiety and threat avoidance in GAD65 knock-out mice.,"Anxiety disorders have been linked to a disbalance of excitation and inhibition in a network of brain structures comprising frontal cortical regions, the amygdala and the hippocampus, among others. Recent imaging studies suggest sex differences in the activation of this anxiety network during the processing of emotional information. Rodent models with genetically altered ϒ-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission allow studying the neuronal basis of such activation shifts and their relation to anxiety endophenotypes, but to date sex effects have rarely been addressed. Using mice with a null mutation of the GABA synthetizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65-/-), we started to compare anxiety-like behavior and avoidance in male vs. female GAD65-/- mice and their wildtype littermates. In an open field, female GAD65-/- mice displayed increased activity, while male GAD65-/- mice showed an increased adaptation of anxiety-like behavior over time. GAD65-/- mice of both sexes had a higher preference for social interaction partners, which was further heightened in male mice. In male mice higher escape responses were observed during an active avoidance task. Together, female mice showed more stable emotional responses despite GAD65 deficiency. To gain insights into interneuron function in network structures controlling anxiety and threat perception, fast oscillations (10-45 Hz) were measured in ex vivo slice preparations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). GAD65-/- mice of both sexes displayed increased gamma power in the ACC and a higher density of PV-positive interneurons, which are crucial for generating such rhythmic activity. In addition, GAD65-/- mice had lower numbers of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the basolateral amygdala and in the dorsal dentate gyrus especially in male mice, two key regions important for anxiety and active avoidance responses. Our data suggest sex differences in the configuration of GABAergic interneurons in a cortico-amygdala-hippocampal network controlling network activity patterns, anxiety and threat avoidance behavior.",2023
Pharmacological Treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder: Current Practice and Future Directions.,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common psychiatric condition, characterized by the presence of general apprehensiveness and excessive worry. Current management consists of a range of pharmacological and psychological treatments. However, many patients do not respond to first-line pharmacological treatments and novel anxiolytic drugs are being developed. In this review, the authors first discuss the diagnostic criteria and epidemiology of GAD. The effective pharmacological treatments for GAD and their tolerability are addressed. Current consensus guidelines for treatment of GAD are discussed, and maintenance treatment, the management of treatment resistance, and specific management of older adults and children/adolescents are considered. Finally, novel anxiolytics under development are discussed, with a focus on those which have entered clinical trials. A range of effective treatments for GAD are available, particularly duloxetine, escitalopram, pregabalin, quetiapine, and venlafaxine. There is a limited evidence base to support the further pharmacological management of patients with GAD who have not responded to initial treatment. Although many novel anxiolytics have progressed to clinical trials, translation from animal models has been mostly unsuccessful. However, the potential of several compounds including certain psychedelics, ketamine, oxytocin, and agents modulating the orexin, endocannabinoid, and immune systems merits further study.",2023
Cerebellar gamma-aminobutyric acid: Investigation of group effects in neurodevelopmental disorders.,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are thought to arise in part from the disruption in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the brain. Recent evidence has shown the involvement of the cerebellum in cognition and affect regulation, and cerebellar atypical function or damage is reported frequently in NDDs. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have reported decreases in GABA in cortical brain areas in the NDDs, however, GABA levels in the cerebellum have not been examined. To determine possible group effects, we used a MEGA-PRESS acquisition to investigate GABA+ levels in a cerebellar voxel in 343 individuals (aged 2.5-22 years) with ASD, ADHD, OCD and controls. Using a mixed effects model, we found no significant differences between groups in GABA+ concentration. Our findings suggest that cerebellar GABA+ levels do not differentiate NDD groups.",2023
New frontiers in the pharmacological treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults: an up-to-date comprehensive overview.,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with scarce functioning and poor quality of life. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are currently first-line treatments, side effects are common and affect treatment compliance in approximately 50% of patients. This review aimed to summarize data on the efficacy of unlabeled molecules for SAD treatment. Research in the main psychiatric databases was conducted (PubMed, PsychINFO, and EMBASE-Ovid) to select studies investigating the efficacy of marketed molecules not labeled for SAD treatment. Pregabalin at high doses (450-600 mg/day) appears to be a reliable alternative strategy for SAD treatment. Among the SSRIs not labeled for SAD, citalopram showed the most promising results. Quetiapine, levetiracetam, and other antidepressants/serotonergic agents, such as fluoxetine, duloxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, mirtazapine, atomoxetine, nefazodone, vilazodone, and buspirone, presented negative, limited, or contrasting results. Data on anticonvulsants, olanzapine, tiagabine, and ketamine were positive, but preliminary. The risk/benefit ratio must be considered in the prescription of unlabeled compounds; treatment with pregabalin may be associated with somnolence and dizziness. Future research may contribute to the identification of targeted molecules for the treatment of this disorder.",2023
Alcohol use disorder with comorbid anxiety disorder: a case report and focused literature review.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety disorders (AnxD) are prevalent health concerns in clinical practice which frequently co-occur (AUD-AnxD) and compound one another. Concurrent AUD-AnxD poses a challenge for clinical management as approaches to treatment of one disorder may be ineffective or potentially counterproductive for the other disorder. We present the case of a middle-aged man with anxiety disorder, AUD, chronic pain, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate use in context of tapering prescribed benzodiazepines who experienced severe alcohol withdrawal episodes during a complicated course of repeated inpatient withdrawal management. After medical stabilization, the patient found significant improvement in symptoms and no return to alcohol use with a regimen of naltrexone targeting his AUD, gabapentin targeting both his AUD and AnxD, and engagement with integrated psychotherapy, Alcoholics Anonymous, and addictions medicine follow-up. Proper recognition and interventions for AUD and AnxD, ideally with overlapping efficacy, can benefit individuals with comorbid AUD-AnxD. Gabapentin, tobacco cessation, and integrated psychotherapy have preliminary evidence of synergistic effects in AUD-AnxD. Meta-analysis evidence does not support serotoninergic medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) which are commonly prescribed in AnxD and mood disorders as their use has not been associated with improved outcomes for AUD-AnxD. Additionally, several double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials have suggested that serotonergic medications may worsen alcohol-related outcomes in some individuals with AUD. Areas for future investigation are highlighted.",2022
Neonatal inflammation via persistent TGF-β1 downregulation decreases GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression in basolateral amygdala leading to the imbalance of the local excitation-inhibition circuits and anxiety-like phenotype in adult mice.,"Neonatal inflammation can increase the risk of anxiety disorder in adulthood. The balance between glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory transmissions in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a vital role in controlling anxiety state. Based on the reports that early-life inflammation had adverse effects on GABAergic system, the aim of this study was to investigate whether and how neonatal inflammation affects excitatory-inhibitory circuits in the BLA resulting in anxiety disorder. Neonatal mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or saline on postnatal days 3-5. LPS-treated mice developed anxiety behaviors accompanied by the hyperactivity of adrenal axis in adulthood. Electrophysiological study revealed the increase of postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the cortical-BLA excitatory synapses of LPS mice which could be recovered by bath-application of GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist suggesting the impairment of GABAergic system in LPS mice. Compared with controls, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rα2 subunit expression and density of GABA-evoked current in BLA principal neurons were reduced in LPS mice. Additionally, neonatal LPS treatment resulted in the down-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression and PKC signaling pathway in the adult BLA. The local TGF-β1 overexpression in the BLA improved GABA<sub>A</sub>Rα2 expression via up-regulating the activity of PKC signaling, which corrected GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibition leading to the abolishment of anxiety-like change in adrenal axis regulation and behaviors in LPS mice. These data suggest the persistent TGF-β1deficit induces the down-regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rα2 expression and subsequent disruption of the excitation-inhibition balance in the BLA circuits, which is the important mechanisms of neonatal inflammation-induced anxiety disorder.",2022
A theory of the anxiolytic action of flumazenil in anxiety disorders.,"Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent affecting up to 33.7% of people over a lifetime. Although many treatment options are available, they are often associated with unacceptable side-effect profiles and approximately one in three patients are treatment resistant. Allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid acting as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, is synthesised in response to stress and acts to negatively modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. After chronic exposure to and withdrawal from allopregnanolone, an increase in α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>δ GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors results in a reduced inhibitory effect of allopregnanolone, resulting in decreased inhibition and, therefore, increased neuronal excitability. The relationship between allopregnanolone and increased α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>δ GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has been demonstrated in animal models during methamphetamine withdrawal and puberty, events both associated with stress. The effect of allopregnanolone during these events is anxiogenic, a paradoxical action to its usual anxiolytic effects. Flumazenil, the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, has been shown to cause receptor internalisation of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>δ GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which may results in anxiolysis. We propose that chronic stress and chronic exposure to and withdrawal from allopregnanolone in anxiety disorders result in alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function, which can be corrected by flumazenil. As such, flumazenil may exhibit anxiolytic properties in patients with increased α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>δ GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression.",2022
"An aqueous extract of Lantana camara attenuates seizures, memory impairment, and anxiety in kainate-treated mice: Evidence of GABA level, oxidative stress, immune and neuronal loss modulation.","Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) is a plant used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat dementia, epilepsy, and sleeping disorders. Hence, this study aimed to assess the antiepileptic-like effects of an aqueous extract of L. camara leaves on seizures induced by kainate in mice, and possible mechanisms of action. Mice were divided into two groups: a normal control group treated with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, i.p.), and a kainate group treated with kainate (10 mg/kg, i.p.). All mice that developed status epilepticus were individually observed for spontaneous seizures. Eighteen days after the induction of status epilepticus, mice that exhibited spontaneous seizures were further divided into 6 groups of 7 mice each and treated as follows: a kainate group treated with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, p.o.), two positive control groups either treated with sodium valproate (300 mg/kg, p.o.) or with piracetam (200 mg/kg, p.o.), and three test groups received the extract (230, 460, and 917 mg/kg, p.o.). The control group was treated with 0.9% saline (10 ml/kg, p.o.). These treatments lasted 14 days and the animals were observed 6 h per day for behavioral seizures. Subsequently, the animals were evaluated for anxiety disorders and memory impairment. Animals were then sacrificed and the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex was collected for histological and biochemical analyses. Furthermore, the dilacerates of the hippocampi were stored for white blood cell count. The aqueous extract of L. camara (460 mg/kg) remarkably decreased (p < 0.001) the number and duration of seizures compared to sodium valproate. Also, it significantly increased the level of GABA both in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and protected these organs from oxidative stress. Furthermore, the extract (230 mg/kg) induced the highest reduction in the number of white blood cells in the hippocampus. Finally, the extract (917 mg/kg) significantly attenuated neuronal loss in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. All these compared to the negative control. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of L. camara has an antiepileptic-like effect comparable to that of sodium valproate. This, therefore, warrants further investigation into the effect of bioactive molecules present in the extract using in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy.",2022
Management of Pregabalin Use Disorder: A Case Series.,"Pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of partial epilepsy, generalized anxiety disorder, and neuropathic pain. The first reports on pregabalin use disorder have been published in Europe in 2010 and notified to the French Addictovigilance Network (FAN) in 2011. The management of pregabalin use disorder is challenging due to the risks associated with the abrupt withdrawal and lack of guidelines. In this retrospective observational study, the management of pregabalin use disorder was analyzed in eight cases reported to the addictovigilance center of Montpellier, France, between 2019 and 2020. Most of these patients had a history of illicit psychoactive substance use. During the withdrawal period, patients experienced mainly psychiatric problems, nervous system symptoms, general disorders, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Multiple strategies were proposed for these patients to manage pregabalin withdrawal, such as hospitalization and pregabalin gradual dose reduction with or without adjuvant medications. Two patients relapsed and the others were lost to follow up. Although other reports of pregabalin use disorder have been published, recommendations or guidelines for its management are not yet available. The current case series and the previous reports suggest that the use of adjunctive therapy may be useful to limit the risk of convulsions and anxiety.",2022
Pregabalin withdrawal in patients without psychiatric disorders taking a regular dose of pregabalin: A case series and literature review.,"Pregabalin is a drug that can cause psychiatric symptoms via pregabalin withdrawal. Prior reports on pregabalin withdrawal have mainly focused on cases with pregabalin dependence or abuse, and little attention has been paid to patients who are prescribed regular doses of pregabalin. Herein, we report three cases of pregabalin withdrawal in patients without psychiatric disorders, taking regular doses of pregabalin, who developed psychiatric symptoms such as insomnia and anxiety after abrupt discontinuation of pregabalin. In addition, we conducted a systematic review of six case reports (previous studies) of pregabalin withdrawal under regular doses of pregabalin. Among the six cases, three patients had no comorbid mental or substance use disorders, the dose of pregabalin ranged from 150 to 600 mg/d, and the duration of pregabalin use ranged from a few weeks to many years. Of these six cases of pregabalin withdrawal, five had psychopathological symptoms, three had vegetative symptoms, and three had neurologic and physical complications. We concluded that since pregabalin withdrawal can occur even with regular doses and short-term use, clinicians must carefully reduce pregabalin doses when reducing or discontinuing treatment, paying close attention to withdrawal symptoms. Our case series sheds light on the scant evidence from previous research on physical dependence in patients who are taking regular doses of pregabalin. Furthermore, our cases were also valuable in demonstrating that pregabalin withdrawal can occur even after a relatively short period of 2 months.",2021
"Effects of a single oral dose of gabapentin on storm phobia in dogs: A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.","Storm phobia in companion dogs is a common disorder that significantly impacts dogs' welfare. Gabapentin, the action of which is only partially understood, is widely used for its antiepileptic and analgesic properties. Only recently, the veterinary community began to use gabapentin to address phobia and anxiety in dogs. This study tested gabapentin to lower fear responses of dogs during a thunderstorm event. Eighteen dogs suffering from storm phobia completed our double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each dog's behaviour was evaluated twice by his owner: once under placebo, once under gabapentin. The treatment was orally administered at least 90 min before the exposure. Gabapentin was given at a dose ranging from 25 to 30 mg/kg. Our results indicate a significant reduction of the fear responses of dogs under gabapentin. The adverse effects were rare, and the most frequent amongst them was ataxia. In this trial, gabapentin appears to be an efficient and safe molecule that should be considered as part of the treatment plan of storm phobia in dogs.",2021
"Increasing the dosage of pregabalin in patients with focal epilepsy decreases the frequency of seizures and ameliorates symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia.","The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the adequate dosage of medications. In clinical practice, drugs are often used at doses that are too low, which results in suboptimal levels of clinical improvement. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of increasing the dose of previously taken pregabalin in a group of patients with focal epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This open study involved 993 patients (46 ± 14 years old) suffering from epilepsy with focal seizures and concomitant GAD treated with pregabalin add-on therapy. The severity of anxiety was assessed with GAD-7 Scale. The number of epileptic seizures was monitored before and after the increase of the pregabalin dose. On the initial visit, the mean daily dose of pregabalin was 159 ± 82 mg. During the study period (nine months) the mean dose was increased to 327 ± 163 mg. After nine months, based on the intention-to-treat analysis, 27.1% (N = 253) of the subjects experienced seizure resolution, and 57.8% (N = 539) reduction in seizure frequency by at least 50%. At the beginning of the study, despite pregabalin administration, 60.7% of patients were above the diagnostic threshold for GAD diagnosis. The add-on therapy resulted in the improvement of the depressive and anxiety symptoms, and insomnia, greater in those that experienced seizure resolution or reduction in their frequency. (1) Patients with focal epilepsy with concomitant anxiety disorder experience reduction in seizure frequency, improvement of anxiety, depressive symptoms and insomnia using PGB as an add-on therapy. (2) Our data suggest that pregabalin as an add-on treatment is a reasonable choice for patients with focal epilepsy who have concomitant symptoms of an anxiety disorder.",2020
The characterization of psychotic symptoms in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency: a review.,"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is an ultra-rare inborn error of metabolism that results in disrupted gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) catabolism. In addition to developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, and seizures, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur, including psychosis. By highlighting all available and relevant case reports/series, this qualitative review seeks to characterize the prevalence, clinical manifestation, pathophysiology, and treatment of psychotic symptoms in this population. Psychosis occurs in a minority of SSADH-deficient individuals, and most commonly presents as auditory or visual hallucinations with an onset in adolescence or young adulthood. Although the pathophysiology underlying the development of psychosis in this context is not fully understood, it likely in part relates to increased GABA and/or gamma hydroxybutyric acid activity. Although antipsychotic medications should be used cautiously in SSADH deficiency, they may be effective at treating emergent psychotic symptoms.",2020
Awake Bruxism Treated with Pregabaline in a Patient with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,"Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations. There are two types of bruxism, awake bruxism and sleep bruxism. Awake bruxism is generally treated by dentists and maxilla-facial surgeons through several treatment modalities such as, counselling about triggers, relaxation, occlusal splints and botulinum toxin type A injections. We will present the case of a 21-year-old woman presenting mood swings with a high level of anxiety and concentration difficulties since childhood. She also complained of awake bruxism. Intelligence was evaluated using The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated through a neuropsychology test. Intelligence evaluation showed normal intellectual function. Neuropsychology test showed a profile corresponding to ADHD. Bupropion XR 300 mg was initiated for ADHD. Pregabalin was prescribed for general anxiety syndrome. The patient reported a complete disappearance of awake bruxism at a daily dose of 375 mg, with no occlusal appliances. Following the improvement of the anxiety symptoms, the attempt to reduce the dose twice leading to the recurrence of bruxism. A 21 years old female treated with 375 mg daily doses of pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder experienced a significant reduction of daytime bruxism. More studies are needed to determine whether pregabalin has a long term effect against awake bruxism.",2020
GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptors: Anxiety and Mood Disorders.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, acts at the ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, and the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. This chapter summarizes the studies that have investigated the role of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor in stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety and mood disorders. Overall, clinical and preclinical evidences strongly suggest that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is a therapeutic candidate for depression and anxiety disorders. However, the clinical development of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-based drugs to treat these disorders has been hampered by their potential side-effects, particularly those of agonists. Nevertheless, the discovery of novel GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor allosteric modulators, and increasing understanding of the influence of specific intracellular GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-associated proteins on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activity, may now pave the way towards GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor therapeutics in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.",2022
Altered glutamate concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with resting-state functional connectivity in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",2025
Neurobiological differences in early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder: A study of the glutamatergic system based on functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"In this study, the combination of functional state magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) and cognitive tasks was used to conduct subgroup analyses on early-onset OCD (EO) and non-early-onset OCD (non-EO) and explore differences in the glutamatergic system and cognitive function among OCD subtypes. A total of 70 OCD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical evaluation and were subsequently divided into the EO or non-EO groups. Next, both resting and functional state MRS data were collected, with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) serving as the region of interest. Quantitative analysis of MRS data yielded precise neurometabolic concentrations, which were then statistically analyzed alongside inhibitory function, as measured by the Go-nogo task. The final analysis included 92 participants (22 EO-OCD, 41 non-EO OCD, and 29 HCs). EO-OCD patients had significantly higher Glx levels (p = 0.044) and lower GSH levels (p = 0.009) in the functional state compared to the non-EO group. Moreover, in the EO group, correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the functional state Glx levels and the average response time for errors in the nogo task (r = 0.526, p = 0.014). Additionally, resting-state GSH levels were positively correlated with total Y-BOCS scores (r = 0.854, p < 0.001). Overall, early-onset OCD may represent a distinct subtype that requires targeted interventions, as evidenced by the imbalance in the glutamatergic system observed in early-onset OCD patients. Additionally, in early-onset patients, Glx concentration during activation was related to cognitive impairment.",2025
Glutamate dynamics and BOLD response during OCD symptom provocation in the lateral occipital cortex: A 7 Tesla fMRI-fMRS study.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is linked with dysfunction in frontal-striatal, fronto-limbic, and visual brain regions. Research using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) suggests that altered neurometabolite levels, like glutamate, may contribute to this dysfunction. However, static neurometabolite levels in OCD patients have shown inconsistent results, likely due to previous studies' limited focus on neurometabolite dynamics. We employ functional MRS (fMRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore these dynamics and brain activation during OCD symptom provocation. We utilized a combined 7-tesla fMRI-fMRS setup to examine task-related BOLD response and glutamate changes in the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) of 30 OCD participants and 34 matched controls during an OCD-specific symptom provocation task. The study examined main effects and between-group differences in brain activation and glutamate levels during the task. A whole sample task-effects analysis on data meeting predefined quality criteria showed significant glutamate increases (n = 41 (22 OCD, 19 controls), mean change: 3.2 %, z = 3.75, p < .001) and task activation (n = 54 (26 OCD, 28 controls), p < .001) in the LOC during OCD blocks compared to neutral blocks. However, no differences in task-induced glutamate dynamics or activation between groups were found, nor a correlation between glutamate levels and task activation. We were able to measure task-induced increases in glutamate and BOLD levels, emphasizing its feasibility for OCD research. The absence of group differences highlights the need for further exploration to discern to what extent neurometabolite dynamics differ between OCD patients and controls. Once established, future studies can use pre-post intervention fMRS-fMRI to probe the effects of therapies modulating glutamate pathways in OCD.",2024
Quantification of Glutathione and Its Associated Spontaneous Neuronal Activity in Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial antioxidant in the human brain. Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy sequence is highly recommended, limited literature has measured cortical GSH using this method in major psychiatric disorders. By combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we quantified brain GSH and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus and explored relationships between GSH levels and intrinsic neuronal activity as well as clinical symptoms among healthy control (HC) participants (n = 30), people with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 28), and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n = 28). GSH concentrations were lower in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in both the MDD and OCD groups than in the HC group. In the HC group, positive correlations were noted between GSH and glutamate levels and between GSH and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in both regions. However, while these correlations were absent in both patient groups, there was a weak positive correlation between glutamate and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Moreover, GSH levels were negatively correlated with depressive and compulsive symptoms in MDD and OCD, respectively. These findings suggest that reduced GSH levels and an imbalance between GSH and glutamate could increase oxidative stress and alter neurotransmitter signaling, thereby leading to disruptions in GSH-related neurochemical-neuronal coupling and psychopathologies across MDD and OCD. Understanding these mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the processes that underlie these disorders and potentially become a springboard for future directions and advancing our knowledge of their neurobiological foundations.",2025
New horizons for obsessive-compulsive disorder drug discovery: is targeting glutamate receptors the answer?,"Over the past decade, glutamate has emerged as a prominent focus in the field of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) pathophysiology. A convergence of evidence from genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies points to glutamatergic dysfunction as a key feature of this condition. In light of these findings, there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of glutamatergic agents in the treatment of OCD. This paper reviews the literature on glutamate transmission in OCD. In addition, the authors examine the results of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of glutamatergic agents in the treatment of OCD patients. Along with the recognition of neuroinflammation in the brain in OCD, the evidence of glutamate dysfunction represents one of the most promising recent discoveries for understanding the mechanisms involved in OCD. The importance of this discovery lies primarily in its pharmacological implications and has led to intense research activity in the field of glutamatergic agents. While this research has not yet had a substantial clinical impact, targeting glutamate receptors remains a promising horizon for the successful treatment of OCD patients.",2024
The relationship between oxidative stress markers and 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in obsessive compulsive disorder.,"The purpose of this study was to examine N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid complex (Glx)/Cr levels in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy controls' orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) method and to investigate their relationship with oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This study included patients with OCD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) ranging in age from 18 to 65. We used the ELISA method to evaluate serum SOD and GPx levels. Levels of NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus were measured using the 1H-MRS method. Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3 T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",2024
Excoriation Disorder Is Characterized by Systemic Glutamatergic Dysfunction.,,2024
Glutamatergic abnormalities in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy: A controlled study.,"In this study, we utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to understand the role of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of OCD patients in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). In total, 54 patients with OCD and 54 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex were included in the study. They underwent MRS in the pgACC region to calculate the concentrations of Glu, Gln, GABA, and Glu + Gln (Glx). After quality control of the MRS data, 21 OCD and 21 HC were statistically analyzed. The severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale. The results indicate that patients with OCD present a disturbance in glutamatergic metabolism in the pgACC. The results also demonstrate that these changes correlate with the severity of compulsions.",2023
Cortical glutamate and GABA are related to compulsive behaviour in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and healthy controls.,"There has been little analysis of neurochemical correlates of compulsive behaviour to illuminate its underlying neural mechanisms. We use 7-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to assess the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by measuring glutamate and GABA levels in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) of healthy volunteers and participants with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Within the SMA, trait and clinical measures of compulsive behaviour are related to glutamate levels, whereas a behavioural index of habitual control correlates with the glutamate:GABA ratio. Participants with OCD also show the latter relationship in the ACC while exhibiting elevated glutamate and lower GABA levels in that region. This study highlights SMA mechanisms of habitual control relevant to compulsive behaviour, common to the healthy sub-clinical and OCD populations. The results also demonstrate additional involvement of anterior cingulate in the balance between goal-directed and habitual responding in OCD.",2023
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Etiology, neuropathology, and cognitive dysfunction.","This review provides an overview of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms, including the four partially distinct subtypes of the disorder, current diagnostic criteria, and common comorbidities. Critically, it focuses on the etiology of OCD, including its underlying neuropathology, and examines cognitive dysfunction in OCD. This review study was conducted by library method. We show how dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits may underpin symptoms; and shed light on the putative neurochemistry within these loops such as the role of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate systems. We also show how OCD is characterized by cognitive dysfunction including problems in cognitive flexibility, visuospatial memory, response inhibition, and goal-directed behavior, linked to aberrant activity within CSTC circuits. In brief, research questions we shed light on include (1) what are the symptoms in OCD; (2) what is the etiology of the disorder and do existing models explain OCD; and (3) what are key cognitive deficits in OCD and do these improve with treatment?",2023
Direct changes of neurometabolic concentrations in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex among obsessive-compulsive patients after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment.,"Although Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a promising new noninvasive brain stimulation therapy, its underlying mechanisms of action remain unknown. OCD patients exhibit impaired response control and attention shifting, which is linked to some brain areas such as anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia. OCD patients also display altered neurometabolic concentrations in cortical cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC). In this study, we aimed to elucidate efficacy of rTMS treatment in alleviating related symptoms and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) neurometabolites. OCD patients were randomly divided into either drug (n = 23) or drug + rTMS (n = 29) groups, and those in the latter group subjected to 4-week rTMS treatment. All participants were visited twice, at baseline and follow-up after four weeks. During both visits, all patients were subjected to 1H-MRS, then Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Global Assessment Function (GAF) used to assess severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. We also evaluated synchronous anxiety and depression by Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D). After 4 weeks of treatment, patients in the Drug + rTMS group displayed significantly lower Y-BOCS (p = 0.038), BDI (p = 0.009), HAM-D (p = 0.013), HAM-A (p = 0.012) scores than their counterparts in the Drug group. Conversely, patients in the Drug + rTMS group had significantly higher tNAA concentrations (p = 0.030) than those in the Drug group. Notably, the Drug + rTMS group exhibited higher, but insignificant Glu (p = 0.055) and Glx (p = 0.068) concentrations compared to the Drug group. Partial correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between post HAM-A scores and 4-week change of pACC glutamate levels in the Drug + rTMS group (r = -0.434, p = 0.02). rTMS treatment is an efficacious treatment therapy for OCD, mainly by inducing changes in neurometabolites.",2023
Glutamatergic neurotransmission is affected by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the supplemental motor cortex of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction played key roles in pathophysiology. The current research assessed changes of neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of OCD patients receiving low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using 1H proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). 52 OCD patients were divided into rTMS treatment group (29) and the control group (medication only) (22). The levels of neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD were measured using MRS before and after treatment. All participants were taking medication prior to the treatment and the process. Following rTMS treatment, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was significantly decreased in the rTMS group compared with the control group. Glutamate (Glu) and glutamate and glutamine complexes (Glx) in the bilateral striatum of the rTMS treatment response group increased significantly with the improvement of OCD. Glu in the bilateral striatum and Glx in the right striatum were positively correlated with compulsion after the treatment. The physiopathological mechanism of OCD may be related to the glutamatergic dysfunction, and the low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the supplementary motor area can improve OCD symptoms by modulating glutamatergic levels in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD.",2023
Case Report: Possible autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder with postpartum onset.,"Autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is rare. The case presented here is that of a female patient in her mid-thirties who developed postpartum OCD. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple juxtacortical hyperintensities that may have been post-inflammatory in origin. In tissue-based assays using mouse brain slices, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed novel anti-nucleoli autoantibodies in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons. The CSF dopamine and glutamate concentrations were dysregulated. The clinical course and diagnostic findings were compatible with possible autoimmune OCD with postpartum onset.",2022
Longitudinal changes in neurometabolite concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex after concentrated exposure therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to its role in error processing, cognitive control and emotion regulation. OCD patients have shown altered concentrations in neurometabolites in the dACC, particularly Glx (glutamate+glutamine) and tNAA (N-acetylaspartate+N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate). We investigated the immediate and prolonged effects of exposure and response prevention (ERP) on these neurometabolites. Glx and tNAA concentrations were measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in 24 OCD patients and 23 healthy controls at baseline. Patients received concentrated ERP over four days. A subset was re-scanned after one week and three months. No Glx and tNAA abnormalities were observed in OCD patients compared to healthy controls before treatment or over time. Patients with childhood or adult onset differed in the change over time in tNAA (F(2,40) = 7.24, ɳ<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>= 0.27, p = 0.004): concentrations increased between one week after treatment and follow-up in the childhood onset group (t(39) = -2.43, d = -0.86, p = 0.020), whereas tNAA concentrations decreased between baseline and follow-up in patients with an adult onset (t(42) = 2.78, d = 1.07, p = 0.008). In OCD patients with versus without comorbid mood disorders, lower Glx concentrations were detected at baseline (t(38) = -2.28, d = -1.00, p = 0.028). Glx increased after one week of treatment within OCD patients with comorbid mood disorders (t(30) = -3.09, d = -1.21, p = 0.004). Our OCD sample size allowed the detection of moderate to large effect sizes only. ERP induced changes in neurometabolites in OCD seem to be dependent on mood disorder comorbidity and disease stage rather than OCD itself.",2022
Dorsal striatal dopamine induces fronto-cortical hypoactivity and attenuates anxiety and compulsive behaviors in rats.,"Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",2022
Developmental changes in fronto-striatal glutamate and their association with functioning during inhibitory control in autism spectrum disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) show overlapping symptomatology and deficits in inhibitory control, which are associated with altered functioning and glutamatergic signaling in fronto-striatal circuitry. These parameters have never been examined together. The purpose of the current study was to investigate functioning during inhibitory control and its association with fronto-striatal glutamate concentrations across these disorders using a multi-center, longitudinal approach. Adolescents with ASD (n = 24), OCD (n = 15) and controls (n = 35) underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions with a one-year interval. This included proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS; n = 74) and functional MRI during an inhibitory control task (n = 53). We investigated <sup>1</sup>H-MRS data and fMRI data separately as well as integrated in a multimodal analysis using linear models focusing on diagnosis and continuous measures of overlapping compulsivity symptoms. ACC glutamate was reduced over time in the ASD group compared with controls, while striatal glutamate decreased over time independent of diagnosis. Increased compulsive behavior seemed to be associated with increased striatal activity during failed inhibitory control. The integrated analyses showed differential involvement of increased striatal glutamate during failed but decreased striatal glutamate during successful inhibitory control in the OCD group compared to controls and ASD, suggesting different underlying mechanisms for OCD compared to ASD.",2021
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by structural and functional deficits in the cortico-striato-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry and abnormal neurochemical changes are thought to modulate these deficits. The hypothesis that an imbalanced concentration of the brain neurotransmitters, in particular glutamate (Glu) and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), could impair the normal functioning of the CSTC, thus leading to OCD symptoms, has been tested in humans using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET). This chapter summarises these neurochemical findings and represents an attempt to condense such scattered literature. We also discuss potential challenges in the field that may explain the inconsistent findings and suggest ways to overcome them. There is some convergent research from MRS pointing towards abnormalities in the brain concentration of neurometabolite markers of neuronal integrity, such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho). Lower NAA levels have been found in dorsal and rostral ACC of OCD patients (as compared to healthy volunteers), which increase after CBT and SSRI treatment, and higher Cho concentration has been reported in the thalamus of the OCD brain. However, findings for other neurometabolites are very inconsistent. Studies have reported abnormalities in the concentrations of creatine (Cr), GABA, glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), Ins (myo-inositol), and serotonin (5-HT), but most of the results were not replicated. The question remains whether the NAA and Cho findings are genuinely the only neurochemical abnormalities in OCD or whether the lack of consistent findings for the other neurometabolites is caused by the lower magnetic field (1-3 Tesla (T)) used by the studies conducted so far, their small sample sizes or a lack of proper control for medication effects. To answer these questions and to further inform the biological underpinning of the symptoms and the cognitive problems at the basis of OCD we need better controlled studies using clear medicated vs unmedicated groups, larger sample sizes, stronger magnetic fields (e.g. at 7 T), and more consistency in the definition of the regions of interest.",2021
Neurochemical correlates of behavioral treatment of pediatric trichotillomania.,"Trichotillomania (TTM) is a chronic and impairing psychiatric disorder with suspected dysfunctional cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit activity reflecting excitatory/inhibitory signaling imbalance. TTM neurochemistry is understudied, with no prior research using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This pilot investigation examined associations between TTM diagnosis, symptom severity, and response to behavioral treatment with MRS neurometabolites glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in CSTC structures. Proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) MRS was acquired from bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and proximal white matter in 10 unmedicated girls with TTM, ages 9-17 years, before and after treatment, and from 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Nine of 10 TTM patients were treatment responders. Pretreatment mean Glu and GABA did not differ significantly between participants and controls. Pretreatment TTM symptoms were correlated with Glu in (left + right) pACC (r = 0.88, p = 0.02) and thalamus (r = 0.82, p = 0.012), and were negatively correlated with pACC GABA (r = -0.84, p = 0.034). Mean GABA in putamen increased 69% (baseline to post-treatment) (p = 0.027). Higher pretreatment Glu in caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus predicted greater symptom decreases with treatment (all r < -0.6, p < 0.05); higher caudate GABA predicted less treatment-related symptom decline (r = 0.86, p = 0.014). Small sample, GABA quantified with spectral fitting rather than editing. Consistent with other neuroimaging, MRS reveals discrete CSTC chemical changes with effective behavior therapy, and possibly with TTM etiology. TTM symptoms relate to excess excitatory versus inhibitory signaling in pACC and thalamus; symptom improvement may reflect reduced excitatory drive of the CSTC direct-pathway activity.",2020
Analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with obsessive<b>-</b>compulsive disorder comorbid skin<b>-</b>picking disorder.,"To investigate the neurobiochemical characteristics of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comorbid skin-picking disorder (SPD), and to provide reference for the pathophysiological basis for OCD. We examined the levels of glutamate and other neurochemicals in ACC of 30 adult OCD patients (13 with comorbid SPD, 17 without SPD), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) at 3T. The clinical evaluation and the quantitative analysis of metabolites were carried out in the two groups. OCD patients with comorbid SPD showed significantly lower ACC glutamate than the patients without SPD (<i>P</i>=0.001). In all OCD patients, glutamate was negatively correlated with scores of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (<i>r</i>=-0.55, <i>P</i>=0.002). Moreover, the ACC glutamate of female patients was correlated with the total score of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (<i>r</i>=0.69, <i>P</i>=0.041) in the OCD with comorbid SPD patients. Alterations of the glutamate content in the ACC are involved in the pathophysiological process of OCD with comorbid SPD, which provides evidence for the study on the pathogenesis of OCD and SPD.",2020
Thin graphene oxide nanoflakes modulate glutamatergic synapses in the amygdala cultured circuits: Exploiting synaptic approaches to anxiety disorders.,"Anxiety disorders (ADs) are nervous system maladies involving changes in the amygdala synaptic circuitry, such as an upregulation of excitatory neurotransmission at glutamatergic synapses. In the field of nanotechnology, thin graphene oxide flakes with nanoscale lateral size (s-GO) have shown outstanding promise for the manipulation of excitatory neuronal transmission with high temporal and spatial precision, thus they were considered as ideal candidates for modulating amygdalar glutamatergic transmission. Here, we validated an in vitro model of amygdala circuitry as a screening tool to target synapses, towards development of future ADs treatments. After one week in vitro, dissociated amygdalar neurons reconnected forming functional networks, whose development recapitulated that of the tissue of origin. When acutely applied to these cultures, s-GO flakes induced a selective modification of excitatory activity. This type of interaction between s-GO and amygdalar neurons may form the basis for the exploitation of alternative approaches in the treatment of ADs.",2020
Immunological Disturbances and Neuroimaging Findings in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Comorbid Patients.,"Mood disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, in particular, appear to be some of the most common psychiatric disorders with a high rate of comorbidity most frequently of anxiety or substance abuse disorders (alcohol use disorder). In both cases - MDD and AUD, a number of immunological disturbances are observed, such as chronic mild inflammation response, increased level of cytokines, hypercortisolaemia, which lead to specific changes in brain neurotransmitter functions. Some of the contemporary brain imaging techniques are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic spectroscopy which are most commonly used to assess the brain metabolism and functional connectivity changes such as altered responses to emotional stimuli in MDD or overactivation of ventromedial prefrontal areas during delayed and underactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal regions during impulsive reward decisions in AUD and dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or glutamate neurotransmitter systems, low NAA and myo-Inositol in both MDD and AUD.",2020
Reduced anterior cingulate glutamate of comorbid skin-picking disorder in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by hyperactivity in a network of forebrain structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Convergent evidence suggests that glutamatergic dysfunction may contribute to the disorder. Skin picking disorder (SPD) was listed as one of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, which is often comorbid with OCD and share overlapping phenomenology and pathophysiology. However, potential confounding effects between the two diagnostic effects on neurotransmitter levels remain largely unexamined. We examined the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) glutamate and other neurochemicals in 62 subjects using a single-voxel acquisition 1H MRS at 3Tesla; of these, 47 subjects yielded usable measurements of both glutamate and glutamine and were included in the analysis (17 medicated with OCD alone, 13 medicated with comorbid OCD + SPD, 17 healthy control). OCD with comorbid SPD showed significantly lower pACC glutamate than in patients without SPD (p = 0.001) or control subjects (p = 0.035). OCD without SPD subjects showed pACC glutamate levels indistinguishable from controls (p = 0.501). In the OCD with SPD subjects, glutamate was correlated with Y-BOCS total score in female patients (n = 9, r = 0.69, p = 0.041). The main limitation of the study was the cross-sectional data. Our patients were on SSRI medication which may have modified the effect of SPD and OCD interaction on glutamate activity. Our results suggest that alterations of the glutamatergic system may play an important role in the pathophysiology of a subgroup of OCD and reduced pACC glutamate may be a biomarker of a distinct subset of OCD patients.",2020
Effects of glutamate-related drugs on anxiety and compulsive behavior in rats with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"<b>Objective</b>: Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We examined the effects and potential mechanism of glutamate-related drugs on compulsive behavior in quinpirole (QNP)-sensitized rats, to deepen our understanding of the link between OCD and glutamate.<b>Method</b>: This study systematically compared the effects of the partial NMDA agonist D-Cycloserine and the NMDA antagonist NVP-AAMO77, Ro25-6981 on compulsive behavior using the elevated zero maze, open field, and marble burying tests in QNP-induced OCD model.<b>Results</b>: The competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists NVP-AAMO77 (5 mg/kg) and Ro25-6981 (5 mg/kg) significantly inhibited anxiety-like and compulsive behavior in rats. And D-Cycloserine at all doses showed significant suppression on anxiety-like and marble-burying behavior. Glutamic acid (Glu) levels, reflecting changes in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, were significantly decreased in rat hippocampus of the NVP-AAMO77 and D-Cycloserine-treated group compared to the saline-treated group. The levels of other amino acids were unaffected. Moreover, NVP-AAMO77 significantly decreased the expression of the subunit NR2A of the NMDAR, and Ro25-6981 suppressed the level of the subunit NR2B of the NMDAR, while D-Cycloserine decreased both the subunit NR2A and NR2B of the NMDAR.<b>Conclusion</b>: Collectively, these findings suggest a functional role of NMDARs in anxiety and compulsive behaviors, with NMDARs inhibition promoting anxiolytic-like and anti-compulsive responses. These findings suggest that D-cycloserine, NVP-AAMO77, and Ro25-6981 could be useful drugs for the treatment of OCD, which may be due to the suppression of NR2A- or NR2B- containing NMDAR.",2020
Is glutamate associated with fear extinction and cognitive behavior therapy outcome in OCD? A pilot study.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure and response prevention is a well-established treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is based on the principles of fear extinction. Fear extinction is linked to structural and functional variability in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and has been consistently associated with glutamate neurotransmission. The relationship between vmPFC glutamate and fear extinction and its effects on CBT outcome have not yet been explored in adults with OCD. We assessed glutamate levels in the vmPFC using 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and fear extinction (learning and recall) using skin conductance responses during a 2-day experimental paradigm in OCD patients (n = 17) and in healthy controls (HC; n = 13). Obsessive-compulsive patients (n = 12) then received manualized CBT. Glutamate in the vmPFC was negatively associated with fear extinction recall and positively associated with CBT outcome (with higher glutamate levels predicting a better outcome) in OCD patients. Glutamate levels in the vmPFC in OCD patients were not significantly different from those in HC, and were not associated with OCD severity. Our results suggest that glutamate in the vmPFC is associated with fear extinction recall and CBT outcome in adult OCD patients.",2020
Association between prefrontal glutamine levels and neuroticism determined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"There is growing evidence for GABA and glutamate-glutamine dysfunction in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders. It is important to study this pathology in the early phases of the illness in order to develop new approaches to secondary prevention. New magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures allow determining glutamine, the principal metabolite of synaptic glutamate that is directly related to glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft, as well as glutamate and GABA. In contrast to previous investigations, this study used community-based recruitment methods and a combined categorical and dimensional approach to psychopathology. In the study protocol, neuroticism was defined as the primary outcome. Neuroticism shares a large proportion of its genetic variance with mood and anxiety disorders. We examined young adult participants recruited from the general population in a cross-sectional study using 3-T 1H-MRS with one voxel in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The total sample of N = 110 (61 females) included 18 individuals suffering from MDD and 19 individuals suffering from DSM-IV anxiety disorders. We found that glutamine and glutamine-to-glutamate ratio were correlated with neuroticism in the whole sample (r = 0.263, p = 0.005, and n = 110; respectively, r = 0.252, p = 0.008, and n = 110), even when controlling for depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses (for glutamine: beta = 0.220, p = 0.047, and n = 110). Glutamate and GABA were not significantly correlated with neuroticism (r = 0.087, p = 0.365, and n = 110; r = -0.044, p = 0.645, and n = 110). Lack of self-confidence and emotional instability were the clinical correlates of glutamate-glutamine dysfunction. In conclusion, this study suggests that prefrontal glutamine is increased in early phases of mood and anxiety disorders. Further understanding of glutamate-glutamine dysfunction in stress-related disorders may lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat these disorders.",2019
Locus coeruleus noradrenaline depletion and its differential impact on CO<sub>2</sub>-induced panic and hyperventilation in male and female mice.,"CO<sub>2</sub> exposure has been used to investigate the panicogenic response in patients with panic disorder. These patients are more sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub>, and more likely to experience the ""false suffocation alarm"" which triggers panic attacks. Imbalances in locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) neurotransmission are responsible for psychiatric disorders, including panic disorder. These neurons are sensitive to changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/pH. Therefore, we investigated if LC-NA neurons are differentially activated after severe hypercapnia in mice. Further, we evaluated the participation of LC-NA neurons in ventilatory and panic-like escape responses induced by 20% CO<sub>2</sub> in male and female wild type mice and two mouse models of altered LC-NA synthesis. Hypercapnia activates the LC-NA neurons, with males presenting a heightened level of activation. Mutant males lacking or with reduced LC-NA synthesis showed hypoventilation, while animals lacking LC noradrenaline present an increased metabolic rate compared to wild type in normocapnia. When exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>, males lacking LC noradrenaline showed a lower respiratory frequency compared to control animals. On the other hand, females lacking LC noradrenaline presented a higher tidal volume. Nevertheless, no change in ventilation was observed in either sex. CO<sub>2</sub> evoked an active escape response. Mice lacking LC noradrenaline had a blunted jumping response and an increased freezing duration compared to the other groups. They also presented fewer racing episodes compared to wild type animals, but not different from mice with reduced LC noradrenaline. These findings suggest that LC-NA has an important role in ventilatory and panic-like escape responses elicited by CO<sub>2</sub> exposure in mice.",2024
Large nesting expression in deer mice remains stable under conditions of visual deprivation despite heightened limbic involvement: Perspectives on compulsive-like behavior.,"Visual stimuli and limbic activation varyingly influence obsessive-compulsive symptom expression and so impact treatment outcomes. Some symptom phenotypes, for example, covert repugnant thoughts, are likely less sensitive to sensory stimuli compared to symptoms with an extrinsic focus, that is, symptoms related to contamination, safety, and ""just-right-perceptions."" Toward an improved understanding of the neurocognitive underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive psychobiology, work in naturalistic animal model systems is useful. Here, we explored the impact of visual feedback and limbic processes on 24 normal (NNB) and large (LNB) nesting deer mice, respectively (as far as possible, equally distributed between sexes). Briefly, after behavioral classification into either the NNB or LNB cohorts, mice of each cohort were separated into two groups each and assessed for nesting expression under either standard light conditions or conditions of complete visual deprivation (VD). Nesting outcomes were assessed in terms of size and neatness. After nesting assessment completion, mice were euthanized, and samples of frontal-cortical and hippocampal tissues were collected to determine serotonin and noradrenaline concentrations. Our results show that LNB, as opposed to NNB, represents an inflexible and excessive behavioral phenotype that is not dependent on visually guided action-outcome processing, and that it associates with increased frontal-cortical and hippocampal noradrenaline concentrations, irrespective of lighting condition. Collectively, the current results are informing of the neurocognitive underpinnings of nesting behavior. It also provides a valuable foundation for continued investigations into the noradrenergic mechanisms that may influence the development and promulgation of excessive, rigid, and inflexible behaviors.",2024
"Cerebrospinal fluid findings in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and PANDAS: A systematic literature review.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) are related mental disorders that share genetic, neurobiological, and phenomenological features. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a neuropsychiatric autoimmune disorder with symptoms of OCD and/or TS associated with streptococcal infections. Therefore, PANDAS represents a strong link between OCD, TS, and autoimmunity. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses can provide insight into the central nervous processes in OCD, TS, and PANDAS. A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA criteria was conducted to collect all CSF studies in patients with OCD, TS, and PANDAS. The total number of cases and the heterogeneity of the low number of studies were not sufficient for a meta-analysis to provide a high level of evidence. Nevertheless, meta-analytical statistics could be performed for glutamate, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (degradation product of serotonin), homovanillic acid (degradation product of dopamine), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (major metabolite of noradrenaline), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in OCD. A risk-of-bias assessment was implemented using the Cochrane ROBINS-E tool. Meta-analytical testing identified elevated glutamate levels in the CSF of OCD patients compared with healthy controls, while no significant differences were found in other neurotransmitters or CRH. Single studies detected novel neuronal antibodies in OCD patients and elevated oligoclonal bands in TS patients. For TS and PANDAS groups, there was a dearth of data. Risk of bias assessment indicated a substantial risk of bias in most of the included studies. This systematic review of available CSF data shows that too few studies are currently available for conclusions with good evidence. The existing data indicates glutamate alterations in OCD and possible immunological abnormalities in OCD and TS. More CSF studies avoiding sources of bias are needed.",2024
"Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.",2023
Pharmacological Treatment for Pediatric Anxiety Disorders.,"Pediatric anxiety disorders (PADs) occur in up to 20% of youth and can cause impairment across the lifespan. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added unique pressures on those with PADs, as children and adolescents endured the longest pandemic restrictions, stymieing their ability to develop socially, emotionally, and cognitively. Although first-line treatment for PADs is psychotherapy, those with severe anxiety symptoms will require pharmacological interventions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications are effective in treating PADs, yet only duloxetine (a SNRI) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children aged >7 years with generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment of children and adolescents with benzodiazepines for PADs presents unique challenges with potential paradoxical reactions. Caution must be observed as well due to risk for misuse related to long-term use of benzodiazepines with PADs. [<i>Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 60</i>(9), 6-9.].",2022
"Comparative effectiveness of cognitive behavioral treatment, serotonin, and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors for anxiety in children and adolescents: a network meta-analysis.","Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line treatments for childhood anxiety disorders (ADs). The objective of this current analysis was to conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two in treating pediatric ADs. The studies included consisted of randomized controlled trials evaluating non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. clomipramine), SSRIs, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, CBT, or a combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy. Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were 18 years or younger. A total of 86 studies were included, with a total of 7594 participants, of which 41.51% were females. For remission, all three treatments were significantly more effective than both placebo (ORs ranging from 0.07 and 0.18) and wait-list (ORs ranging from 0.06 and 0.16). In terms of the severity of anxiety symptoms, all treatment forms were significantly more effective for reducing anxiety than wait-list (standardized mean differences (SMDs) ranging from 0.98 and 2.91). Only pharmacotherapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo (SMD = 2.01, 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.01). Overall, the results demonstrate that CBT, pharmacotherapy, and their combination are effective treatments for childhood ADs. There was no significant difference between the three treatment forms. However, CBT was associated with lower attrition rates. CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two should all be considered to treat youths with ADs. However, potential risks and benefits should be considered before devising a treatment plan.",2023
Pharmacological depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine with para-chlorophenylalanine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine reverses the antidepressant-like effects of adolescent caffeine exposure in the male rat.,"Adolescent exposure to caffeine has been shown to decrease immobility in the forced swim test, suggesting and antidepressant-like effect of caffeine; however, studies have produced different results with regard to caffeine-induced active behaviors. The present study attempted to clarify the possible neurochemical mechanisms of caffeine's action by selectively depleting norepinephrine with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or serotonin with para-chlorophenylalanine in two separate experiments and assessing the ability for caffeine to alter anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior. Caffeine-treated adolescent male rats were exposed to caffeine (0.25 g/L) in their drinking water beginning on P28. A-methyl-p-tyrosine, para-chlorophenylalanine, or saline were administered prior to light-dark, open field, and forced swim testing beginning on P45. Caffeine-induced reductions in immobility and increases in swimming in the forced swim test were reversed by both a-methyl-p-tyrosine and para-chlorophenylalanine. Caffeine-induced increases in crosses and rears were reversed by para-chlorophenylalanine but not alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, whereas caffeine-induced increases in transitions in the LD test were reversed by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine but not para-chlorophenylalanine. Taken together, these results suggest that caffeine-induced decreases in immobility in male rats requires both norepinephrine and serotonin as depletion of either prevents the induction of immobility by chronic caffeine.",2020
Central norepinephrine transmission is required for stress-induced repetitive behavior in two rodent models of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive behaviors exacerbated by stress. Many OCD patients do not respond to available pharmacotherapies, but neurosurgical ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can provide symptomatic relief. Although the ACC receives noradrenergic innervation and expresses adrenergic receptors (ARs), the involvement of norepinephrine (NE) in OCD has not been investigated. To determine the effects of genetic or pharmacological disruption of NE neurotransmission on marble burying (MB) and nestlet shredding (NS), two animal models of OCD. We assessed NE-deficient (Dbh -/-) mice and NE-competent (Dbh +/-) controls in MB and NS tasks. We also measured the effects of anti-adrenergic drugs on NS and MB in control mice and the effects of pharmacological restoration of central NE in Dbh -/- mice. Finally, we compared c-fos induction in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ACC of Dbh -/- and control mice following both tasks. Dbh -/- mice virtually lacked MB and NS behaviors seen in control mice but did not differ in the elevated zero maze (EZM) model of general anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological restoration of central NE synthesis in Dbh -/- mice completely rescued NS behavior, while NS and MB were suppressed in control mice by anti-adrenergic drugs. Expression of c-fos in the ACC was attenuated in Dbh -/- mice after MB and NS. These findings support a role for NE transmission to the ACC in the expression of stress-induced compulsive behaviors and suggest further evaluation of anti-adrenergic drugs for OCD is warranted.",2020
Anxiety-like behavior induced by 6-OHDA animal model of Parkinson's disease may be related to a dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems in brain areas related to anxiety.,"Anxiety in Parkinson's disease may represent a physiological reaction to the development of other symptoms during disease progression. However, evidence suggests that the incidence of anxiety disorders in Parkinson's disease may be related to neurochemical changes. The present study addresses the question whether dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin levels in brain structures related to Parkinson's disease and anxiety are responsible for anxiety-like behavior by using an animal model of parkinsonism based in the bilateral injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the substantia nigra pars compacta. For this, one day after the injection of 6-OHDA, the animals exhibited hypolocomotion and a lower frequency of rearings in the open field test, which was spontaneously reversed on the last day of motor assessment (day 21). The 6-OHDA injection also induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and contextual fear conditioning test (day 21 and 24, respectively). Neurochemical analysis showed a reduction of dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. In addition, while the serotonin levels were reduced in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, it was increased in the amygdala. The present study indicates that the model of 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonism in rats induced an anxiety-like behavior that may be related to a dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems in brain areas involved with anxiety such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and striatum.",2019
Systematic review and meta-analysis: Dose-response curve of SSRIs and SNRIs in anxiety disorders.,"We aimed to examine the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for anxiety disorders examining overall symptom improvement, likelihood of treatment response, time course of treatment response, individual pharmacological agent, diagnostic indication dose, and tolerability. We searched PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of SSRIs/SNRIs in adult patients with anxiety disorders that provided data at three or more time points. Extracted data included trial duration, weekly/biweekly anxiety scores for 12 weeks. Meta-analysis included 57 trials (N = 16,056). A linear mixed model analysis based on weekly outcome data suggested that for SNRI a logarithmic model offered the best fit compared to placebo (indicating the greatest incremental improvement from baseline occurred early in treatment); whereas for SSRI a linear model provided the best fit (indicating a similar improvement over the duration of the acute treatment phase). There were no significant differences in efficacy between pharmacological agents within each class or when comparing SSRIs to SNRIs. The greatest treatment benefits were observed for social anxiety disorder for both medication classes. Higher doses of SSRIs, but not SNRIs, were associated with significantly greater symptom improvement and likelihood of treatment response. For both medical classes, higher doses were associated with an increased likelihood of dropout due to side effects. SSRIs and SNRIs are effective in treating anxiety disorders. Higher doses of SSRIs within the therapeutic range are associated with greater treatment benefit, whereas higher doses of SNRIs are not.",2019
A functional genetic variation of SLC6A2 repressor hsa-miR-579-3p upregulates sympathetic noradrenergic processes of fear and anxiety.,"Increased sympathetic noradrenergic signaling is crucially involved in fear and anxiety as defensive states. MicroRNAs regulate dynamic gene expression during synaptic plasticity and genetic variation of microRNAs modulating noradrenaline transporter gene (SLC6A2) expression may thus lead to altered central and peripheral processing of fear and anxiety. In silico prediction of microRNA regulation of SLC6A2 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays and identified hsa-miR-579-3p as a regulating microRNA. The minor (T)-allele of rs2910931 (MAF<sub>cases</sub> = 0.431, MAF<sub>controls</sub> = 0.368) upstream of MIR579 was associated with panic disorder in patients (p<sub>allelic</sub> = 0.004, n<sub>cases</sub> = 506, n<sub>controls</sub> = 506) and with higher trait anxiety in healthy individuals (p<sub>ASI</sub> = 0.029, p<sub>ACQ</sub> = 0.047, n = 3112). Compared to the major (A)-allele, increased promoter activity was observed in luciferase reporter assays in vitro suggesting more effective MIR579 expression and SLC6A2 repression in vivo (p = 0.041). Healthy individuals carrying at least one (T)-allele showed a brain activation pattern suggesting increased defensive responding and sympathetic noradrenergic activation in midbrain and limbic areas during the extinction of conditioned fear. Panic disorder patients carrying two (T)-alleles showed elevated heart rates in an anxiety-provoking behavioral avoidance test (F(2, 270) = 5.47, p = 0.005). Fine-tuning of noradrenaline homeostasis by a MIR579 genetic variation modulated central and peripheral sympathetic noradrenergic activation during fear processing and anxiety. This study opens new perspectives on the role of microRNAs in the etiopathogenesis of anxiety disorders, particularly their cardiovascular symptoms and comorbidities.",2018
CRF modulation of central monoaminergic function: Implications for sex differences in alcohol drinking and anxiety.,"Decades of research have described the importance of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling in alcohol addiction, as well as in commonly co-expressed neuropsychiatric diseases, including anxiety and mood disorders. However, CRF signaling can also acutely regulate binge alcohol consumption, anxiety, and affect in non-dependent animals, possibly via modulation of central monoaminergic signaling. We hypothesize that basal CRF tone is particularly high in animals and humans with an inherent propensity for high anxiety and alcohol consumption, and thus these individuals are at increased risk for the development of alcohol use disorder and comorbid neuropsychiatric diseases. The current review focuses on extrahypothalamic CRF circuits, particularly those stemming from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), found to play a role in basal phenotypes, and examines whether the intrinsic hyperactivity of these circuits is sufficient to escalate the expression of these behaviors and steepen the trajectory of development of disease states. We focus our efforts on describing CRF modulation of biogenic amine neuron populations that have widespread projections to the forebrain to modulate behaviors, including alcohol and drug intake, stress reactivity, and anxiety. Further, we review the known sex differences and estradiol modulation of these neuron populations and CRF signaling at their synapses to address the question of whether females are more susceptible to the development of comorbid addiction and stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases because of hyperactive extrahypothalamic CRF circuits compared to males.",2018
Genetics of generalized anxiety disorder and related traits.,"This review serves as a systematic guide to the genetics of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and further focuses on anxiety-relevant endophenotypes, such as pathological worry fear of uncertainty, and neuroticism. We inspect clinical genetic evidence for the familialityl heritability of GAD and cross-disorder phenotypes based on family and twin studies. Recent advances of linkage studies, genome-wide association studies, and candidate gene studies (eg, <i>5-HTT, 5-HT1A, MAOA, BDNF</i>) are outlined. Functional and structural neuroimaging and neurophysiological readouts relating to peripheral stress markers and psychophysiology are further integrated, building a multilevel disease framework. We explore etiologic factors in gene-environment interaction approaches investigating childhood trauma, environmental adversity, and stressful life events in relation to selected candidate genes (<i>5-HTT, NPSR1, COMT, MAOA, CRHR1, RGS2</i>), Additionally, the pharmacogenetics of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor treatment are summarized (<i>5-HTT, 5-HT2A, COMT, CRHR1</i>). Finally, GAD and trait anxiety research challenges and perspectives in the field of genetics, including epigenetics, are discussed.",2017
Anxiety disorders: a review of current literature.,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. There is a high comorbidity between anxiety (especially generalized anxiety disorders or panic disorders) and depressive disorders or between anxiety disorders, which renders treatment more complex. Current guidelines do not recommend benzodiazepines as first-line treatments due to their potential side effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatments. Psychotherapy, in association with pharmacotherapy, is associated with better efficacy. Finally, a bio-psycho-social model is hypothesized in anxiety disorders.",2017
A polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter gene is associated with affective and cardiovascular disease through a microRNA mechanism.,"Norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves is removed from the neuroeffector junction via the action of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). NET impairment is evident in several clinically important conditions including major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), essential hypertension and the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We aimed to determine whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the NET gene is associated with NET impairment and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. The analyses were carried out in two cohorts of European ancestry, which included healthy controls and MDD, PD, hypertensive and POTS patients. Compared with controls, cases had significantly higher prevalence of the T allele of rs7194256 (C/T), arterial norepinephrine, depression and anxiety scores, larger left ventricular mass index, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. Bioinformatic analysis identified that the microRNA miR-19a-3p could bind preferentially to the sequence created by the presence of the T allele. This was supported by results of luciferase assays. Compared with controls, cases had significantly lower circulating miR-19a-3p, which was associated with pathways related to blood pressure and regulation of neurotransmission. In vitro norepinephrine downregulated miR-19a-3p. In conclusion, the T allele of the rs7194256 SNP in the 3'UTR of the NET gene is more prevalent in diseases where NET impairment is evident. This might be explained by the creation of a binding site for the microRNA miR-19a-3p. A defect in NET function may potentiate the sympathetic neurochemical signal, predisposing individuals with affective diseases to increased risk of cardiovascular disease development.",2017
Noradrenaline microinjected into the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter causes anxiolytic-like effects in rats tested in the elevated T-maze.,"The dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG) is involved in the integration of behavioral and cardiovascular responses caused by fear and anxiety situations. Some studies suggest an involvement of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the dPAG in anxiety modulation, however, there is no evidence about its role in panic attacks. The goal of this work was to study the effect of NA microinjection in dPAG in rats submitted to the elevated T-maze (ETM). Male Wistar had a cannula implanted in the PAG where it was injected NA in the doses of 1, 3, 15, 45nmol/50nl or artificial cerebrospinal fluid previous the ETM test. NA intra-dPAG decreased inhibitory avoidance behavior in the ETM without changing escape, indicating only an anxiolytic-like effect. Furthermore, the microinjection of NA did not change the general exploratory activity of the animals submitted to the open field test, suggesting that the anxiolytic-like effect is not due to an increase in exploratory activity. The results indicate an involvement of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the dPAG in defensive reactions associated with generalized anxiety, but not as main mechanisms for the panic, in rats submitted to the elevated T-maze providing support for other research aimed at improving the treatment of generalized anxiety.",2016
The impact of combined administration of paraquat and maneb on motor and non-motor functions in the rat.,"Paraquat (PQ) and maneb (MB) are potential risk factors for Parkinson's disease. However, their impact on non-motor disorders, monoamine neurotransmission and basal ganglia function is not clearly determined. Here we investigated the effects of combined treatment with PQ/MB on motor behavior, anxiety and ""depressive-like"" disorders, tissue content of monoamines, and subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuronal activity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intoxicated by PQ (10 mg/kg) and MB (30 mg/kg) twice a week. Two weeks later, the majority of animals (group 1, 16/26) showed a severe loss of body weight with tremor and respiratory distress and others (group 2, 6/26) showed only tremor. Animals of group 2 received PQ/MB during four weeks before developing weight loss. A last group (group 3, 4/26) was insensitive to PQ/MB after 6 weeks of injections. Groups 1 and 2 displayed a failure of motor activity and motor coordination. Group 3 showed slight motor deficits only after the last injection of PQ/MB. Moreover, PQ/MB induced anxiety and ""depressive-like"" behaviors in animals of groups 2 and 3. Biochemical analysis showed that PQ/MB reduced striatal dopamine (DA) tissue content paralleled by changes in the activity of STN neurons without changing the content of norepinephrine and serotonin in the cortex. Our data provide evidence that individuals are not equally sensitive to PQ/MB and show that the motor deficits in vulnerable animals, are not only a result of DA neuron degeneration, but may also be a consequence of peripheral disabilities. Nevertheless, the parkinsonian-like non-motor impairments may be a direct consequence of the bilateral DA depletion.",2015
Plasma catecholamine levels before and after paroxetine treatment in patients with panic disorder.,"Catecholamines such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine are closely related to the autonomic nervous system, suggesting that panic disorder may involve elevated catecholamine levels. This study investigated basal and posttreatment catecholamine levels in patients with panic disorder. A total of 29 patients with panic disorder and 23 healthy controls participated in the study. Panic disorder patients received paroxetine treatment for 12 weeks after clinical tests and examination had been conducted. We investigated the difference in basal levels of catecholamine and measured the changes in catecholamine levels before and after drug treatment in panic disorder patients. The basal plasma epinephrine (48.87±6.18 pg/ml) and dopamine (34.87±3.57 pg/ml) levels of panic disorder patients were significantly higher than those (34.79±4.72 pg/ml and 20.40±3.53 pg/ml) of the control group. However, basal plasma norepinephrine levels did not show statistically significant differences between patients and controls. After drug therapy, plasma catecholamine levels were nonsignificantly decreased and norepinephrine levels showed a tendency toward a decrease that did not reach significance. In conclusion, this study suggests the possibility of a baseline increase of plasma catecholamine levels and activation of sympathetic nervous systems in patients with panic disorder which may normalize after treatment with paroxetine.",2015
[Treatment-resistant anxiety disorders: A literature review of drug therapy strategies].,"Anxiety disorders are widespread psychiatric conditions with significant social and professional disability, poor quality of life, an increased risk of suicide, and frequent attendance of medical services. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) have demonstrated a rather robust efficacy for the treatment of most of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless a substantial number of patients are resistant or still suffer from residual symptoms despite this first line treatment. The objective of our paper is to review relevant studies for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders resistant to the first line treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a pubmed/medline search for double-blind placebo-controlled trials of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. An adequate trial for a SRI in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should continue for at least 12 weeks. Special considerations of the comorbidities and symptom profile could help in the choice of an appropriate pharmacotherapy. Several trials have highlighted the efficacy of antipsychotics as an add-on to SRI in treatment-resistant OCD such as haloperidol more so when comorbid with a tic disorder, or risperidone that can reduce OCD as well as depressive symptoms. Aripiprazole has been shown efficacious in two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, while the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine remains controversial. Other trials showed some efficacy of anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, topiramate), pindolol, memantin and N-acetylcystein as an adjunctive treatment to SRI for resistant OCD. Few trials have investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or SNRI resistant generalized anxiety disorder showing a failure of adjunctive therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and risperidone. These studies were underpowered and very limited in number. Adjunctive risperidone for resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed benefit in some but not all trials. Olanzapine was beneficial for the reduction of the CAPS score in addition to the improvement of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, prazosin was efficacious by reducing PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and psychological distress. One double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate treatment-resistant social phobia showing no benefit of pindolol add-on paroxetine. Our results demonstrate that the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders is not sufficiently investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, despite a growing evidence in favor of antipsychotics and some other pharmacological agents in resistant OCD and, to a lesser extent, PTSD. Hence, there is a crucial need for larger double-blind placebo-controlled trials for resistant anxiety disorders. Finally, being out of the scope of our review, we omitted studies of non-pharmacologic therapies.",2015
"Extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) as adjunctive therapy in patients with generalized anxiety disorder and a history of inadequate treatment response: a randomized, double-blind study.","For many patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), first-line treatment does not lead to remission. This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in patients with GAD and an inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Patients were randomized to quetiapine XR or placebo adjunctive to SSRI/SNRIs in an 11-week study. The primary endpoint was change from randomization to week 8 in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score. Secondary variables were HAM-A psychic/somatic clusters, response, and remission, and Clinical Global Impression–Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score. A total of 409 patients received quetiapine XR (n = 209) or placebo (n = 200). The week 8 mean change in HAM-A total score was not statistically significant for quetiapine XR (–10.74; P = .079) vs placebo (–9.61). Secondary variables were generally consistent with the primary analysis, except for a significant reduction in HAM-A total score (week 1) and significant improvements in HAM-A psychic cluster and CGI-S total scores (week 8). Adverse events included dry mouth, somnolence, sedation, headache, and dizziness. In patients with GAD and an inadequate response to SSRI/ SNRIs, adjunctive quetiapine XR did not show a statistically significant effect for the primary endpoint at week 8, although some secondary endpoints were statistically significant vs placebo. Quetiapine XR was generally well tolerated.",2013
Stress and excitatory synapses: from health to disease.,"Individuals are exposed to stressful events in their daily life. The effects of stress on brain function ranges from highly adaptive to increasing the risk to develop psychopathology. For example, stressful experiences are remembered well which can be seen as a highly appropriate behavioral adaptation. On the other hand, stress is an important risk factor, in susceptible individuals, for depression and anxiety. An important question that remains to be addressed is how stress regulates brain function and what determines the threshold between adaptive and maladaptive responses. Excitatory synapses play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and behavioral adaptation. In this review we discuss how brief and prolonged exposure to stress, in adulthood and early life, regulate the function of these synapses, and how these effects may contribute to behavioral adaptation and psychopathology.",2013
Early life stress sensitizes the renal and systemic sympathetic system in rats.,"We hypothesized that maternal separation (MS), an early life stress model, induces a sensitization of the sympathetic system. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the renal and systemic sympathetic system in 12- to 14-wk-old male control or MS rats with the following parameters: 1) effect of renal denervation on conscious renal filtration capacity, 2) norepinephrine (NE) content in key organs involved in blood pressure control, and 3) acute systemic pressor responses to adrenergic stimulation or ganglion blockade. MS was performed by separating pups from their mothers for 3 h/day from day 2 to 14; controls were nonhandled littermates. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was examined in renal denervated (DnX; within 2 wk) or sham rats using I¹²⁵-iothalamate plasma clearance. MS-DnX rats showed significantly increased GFR compared with MS-SHAM rats (3.8 ± 0.4 vs. 2.4 ± 0.2 ml/min, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas DnX had no effect in controls, indicating that renal nerves regulate GFR in MS rats. NE content was significantly increased in organ tissues from MS rats (P < 0.05, n = 6-8), suggesting a sensitization of the renal and systemic sympathetic system. Conscious MS rats displayed a significantly greater increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to NE (2 μg/kg ip) and a greater reduction in MAP in response to mecamylamine (2 mg/kg ip, P < 0.05, n = 4) monitored by telemetry, indicating that MS rats exhibit exaggerated responses to sympathetic stimulation. In conclusion, these data indicate that MS sensitizes the renal and systemic sympathetic system ultimately impairing blood pressure regulation.",2013
Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with cortisol changes.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but its mechanism of action is largely unknown. Since DBS may induce rapid symptomatic changes and the pathophysiology of OCD has been linked to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, we set out to study whether DBS affects the HPA axis in OCD patients. We compared a stimulation ON and OFF condition with a one-week interval in 16 therapy-refractory OCD patients, treated with DBS for at least one year, targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We measured changes in 24-h urinary excretion of free cortisol (UFC), adrenaline and noradrenaline and changes in obsessive-compulsive (Y-BOCS), depressive (HAM-D) and anxiety (HAM-A) symptom scores. Median UFC levels increased with 53% in the OFF condition (from 93 to 143nmol/24h, p=0.12). There were no changes in urinary adrenaline or noradrenaline excretion. The increase in Y-BOCS (39%), and HAM-D (78%) scores correlated strongly with increased UFC levels in the OFF condition. Our findings indicate that symptom changes following DBS for OCD patients are associated with changes in UFC levels.",2013
The 35% carbon dioxide test in stress and panic research: overview of effects and integration of findings.,"The carbon dioxide test--a vital capacity breath of air containing 35% carbon dioxide (CO(2))--provokes panic attacks in many individuals with panic disorder (PD). It has thus been extensively used as an experimental model of panic and less frequently as a clinical method of provoking symptoms for interoceptive exposure treatment. Recently, stress researchers have suggested another use for the CO(2) test: that of an acute physiological stressor indexing the human stress response. The purpose of this review is to synthesize findings about the effects of the CO(2) test from both the panic and stress literatures in order to advance understanding about this increasingly popular test. Both panic and stress researchers have examined the fleeting effects of the CO(2) test, finding that the test engenders transient breathlessness, dizziness, and minor anxiety in most participants and panic attacks in those with or at risk for PD. Physiological measurements after the test indicate a brief homeostatic disruption in many bodily systems, including increased respiration, systolic blood pressure, and noradrenaline, and decreased heart rate. Most studies indicate increased cortisol. Possible benefits of integrating findings from the panic and stress research lines, given their common use of the CO(2) test, are discussed.",2012
Does yohimbine hydrochloride facilitate fear extinction in virtual reality treatment of fear of flying? A randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"Research suggests that yohimbine hydrochloride (YOH), a noradrenaline agonist, can facilitate fear extinction. It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is stimulated through elevated noradrenaline levels. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the potential exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in a clinical sample of participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for a specific phobia (fear of flying). Sixty-seven participants with fear of flying were randomized to 4 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) combined with YOH (10 mg), or 4 sessions of VRET combined with a placebo. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour exposure sessions consisting of two 25-minute virtual flights. At pre- and post- treatment, fear of flying was assessed. The YOH or placebo capsules were administered 1 h prior to exposures. The manipulation of the noradrenaline activity was confirmed by salivary α-amylase (sAA) samples taken pre-, during and post-exposure. Forty-eight participants completed treatment. Manipulation of noradrenaline levels with YOH was successful, with significantly higher levels of sAA in the YOH group when entering exposure. Results showed that both groups improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment with respect to anxiety reduction. However, although the manipulation of noradrenaline activity was successful, there was no evidence that YOH enhanced outcome. Participants improved significantly on anxiety measures independently of drug condition, after 4 sessions of VRET. These data do not support the initial findings of exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in this dosage in clinical populations.",2012
A two-sample study on the relationship between polygenic risk score of serotonergic polymorphisms and social phobia: Interpersonal adaptability as a mediator.,"The influence of serotonin function on social phobia has been well-documented, yet the polygenic risk score of serotonergic polymorphisms for social phobia remains unclear. We assessed two aspects of social phobia (i.e., social interaction anxiety and social phobia scrutiny fear) and created a polygenic risk score of seven serotonergic polymorphisms in two independent samples. The results from both samples indicated that a greater polygenic risk score, denoting a higher risk of anxiety, was associated with higher levels of social interaction anxiety and social phobia scrutinizing fear. Interestingly, the association between polygenic risk score and social interaction anxiety was mediated by interpersonal adaptability. These findings demonstrate the importance of serotonergic polymorphisms in social phobia and unveil a psychological pathway whereby interpersonal adaptability mediates the effect of serotonergic polymorphisms on social phobia.",2025
Serotonergic underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequent and disabling condition, with many patients being treatment-resistant. Improved understanding of its neurobiology is vital for better therapies. Evidence is still conflicting regarding specific serotonergic-related dysfunctions in OCD. We systematically reviewed the literature to provide a quantitative assessment of the role of serotonin (5-HT) in patients with untreated OCD through imaging. We searched for neuroimaging studies investigating central 5-HT tonus in unmedicated patients with OCD, excluding studies comprising treated patients to prevent bias from antidepressant-induced changes in serotonergic tonus. We also conducted a meta-analysis using a homogeneous group of positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography articles that compared 5-HT transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A receptor (HT2AR) binding potential in different brain regions of patients with untreated OCD and healthy controls. The systematic review encompassed 18 articles, with 13 included in the subsequent meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed by a revised form of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We provided standardized mean difference (SMD) values for SERT and 5-HT2AR binding potential measures across 15 different brain regions. Patients with OCD showed lower SERT binding potential in the brainstem (SMD = -1.13, 95% CI [-1.81 to -0.46]), midbrain (SMD = -0.54, 95% CI [-0.92 to -0.16]), and thalamus/hypothalamus regions (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI [-0.99 to -0.18]) with neglectable to moderate heterogeneity. By combining results from 2 decades of molecular imaging studies, we show that individuals with OCD exhibit lower SERT binding potential in specific brain regions, providing compelling evidence of a 5-HT system dysfunction. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain elusive. The limitations include heterogeneity across studies in populations, imaging techniques, and radiotracer usage.",2025
Unveiling serotonergic dysfunction of obsessive-compulsive disorder on prefrontal network dynamics: a computational perspective.,"Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",2024
Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and brain lesions compatible with multiple sclerosis.,"Autoimmune-mediated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can occur in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, a well-studied case study of a patient with OCD and MS-compatible diagnostic findings is presented. The 42-year-old female patient had displayed OCD symptoms for 6 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses detected an increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, and a positive MRZ reaction. Neopterin was increased, but sarcoidosis was excluded. In the absence of neurological attacks and clues for MRI-based dissemination in time, a radiologically isolated syndrome, the pre-disease stage of MS, was diagnosed. Neurotransmitter measurements of CSF detected reduced serotonin levels. In the absence of visible strategic demyelinating lesions within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes. Serotonin abnormalities in MS should be studied further, as they could potentially explain the association between neuroinflammation and mental illnesses.",2024
Ligand coupling mechanism of the human serotonin transporter differentiates substrates from inhibitors.,"The presynaptic serotonin transporter (SERT) clears extracellular serotonin following vesicular release to ensure temporal and spatial regulation of serotonergic signalling and neurotransmitter homeostasis. Prescription drugs used to treat neurobehavioral disorders, including depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, trap SERT by blocking the transport cycle. In contrast, illicit drugs of abuse like amphetamines reverse SERT directionality, causing serotonin efflux. Both processes result in increased extracellular serotonin levels. By combining molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical experiments and using a homologous series of serotonin analogues, we uncovered the coupling mechanism between the substrate and the transporter, which triggers the uptake of serotonin. Free energy analysis showed that only scaffold-bound substrates could initiate SERT occlusion through attractive long-range electrostatic interactions acting on the bundle domain. The associated spatial requirements define substrate and inhibitor properties, enabling additional possibilities for rational drug design approaches.",2024
"Exposure to the pharmaceutical buspirone alters locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and transcripts related to serotonin signaling in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio).","Buspirone is a pharmaceutical used to treat general anxiety disorder by acting on the dopaminergic and serotoninergic system. Buspirone, like many human pharmaceuticals, has been detected in municipal wastewater; however, the environmental exposure risks are unknown for this psychoactive compound. We studied the effects of buspirone on the behavior of zebrafish, focusing on locomotor and anxiolytic behavior. We also measured transcripts associated with oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, and serotonin signaling to identify potential mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes. Concentrations ranged from environmentally relevant (nM) to physiologically active concentrations typical of human pharmaceuticals (μM). Buspirone treatment did not impact survival, nor did it induce deformities in zebrafish treated for 7 days up to 10 μM. There was a positive relationship between locomotor activity and buspirone concentration in dark periods of the visual motor response test. In the light-dark preference test, both the average time per visit to the dark zone and the percent cumulative duration in the dark zone were increased by 1 μM buspirone. Transcript levels of ache, manf, and mbp were decreased in larvae, while the expression of gap43 was increased following exposure to buspirone, indicating potential neurotoxic effects. There was also reduced expression of serotonin-related genes encoding receptors, transporters, and biosynthesis enzymes (i.e., 5ht1aa, sertb, and tph1a). These data increase understanding of the behavioral and molecular responses in zebrafish following waterborne exposure to neuroactive pharmaceuticals like buspirone.",2024
Arbitration between model-free and model-based control is not affected by transient changes in tonic serotonin levels.,"Serotonin has been suggested to modulate decision-making by influencing the arbitration between model-based and model-free control. Disruptions in these control mechanisms are involved in mental disorders such as drug dependence or obsessive-compulsive disorder. While previous reports indicate that lower brain serotonin levels reduce model-based control, it remains unknown whether increases in serotonergic availability might thus increase model-based control. Moreover, the mediating neural mechanisms have not been studied yet. The first aim of this study was to investigate whether increased/decreased tonic serotonin levels affect the arbitration between model-free and model-based control. Second, we aimed to identify the underlying neural processes. We employed a sequential two-stage Markov decision-task and measured brain responses during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 98 participants in a randomized, double-blind cross-over within-subject design. To investigate the influence of serotonin on the balance between model-free and model-based control, we used a tryptophan intervention with three intervention levels (loading, balanced, depletion). We hypothesized that model-based behaviour would increase with higher serotonin levels. We found evidence that neither model-free nor model-based control were affected by changes in tonic serotonin levels. Furthermore, our tryptophan intervention did not elicit relevant changes in Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent activity.",2024
Serotonergic agonism and pharmacologically-induced adolescent stress cause operant-based learning deficits in mice.,"The interplay between environmental stress and genetic factors is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the relative contribution of these causative antecedents in the manifestation of cognitive inflexibility-a phenotype often seen in obsessive-compulsive (OC)- spectrum disorders-is not fully understood. In this study, we treated mice with 50 mg/L corticosterone (CORT, a glucocorticoid stress hormone) in their drinking water during adolescence. In adulthood, we assessed anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity; along with operant-based discrimination and reversal learning. RU-24969, a selective serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonist, was used as an acute pharmacological model of OC-like behaviour. RU-24969 (5 mg/kg) was administered prior to each reversal learning testing session. We found that acute treatment with 5 mg/kg RU-24969 induced stereotyped hyperlocomotion in vehicle- and CORT-treated mice. Furthermore, pre-treatment with CORT in adolescence produced subtle anxiety-like behaviour in adult mice, and also resulted in an impairment to late-stage discrimination learning and alterations to reversal learning. Finally, acute treatment with 5 mg/kg RU-24969 caused an impairment to early-stage reversal learning. Whilst we revealed dissociable detrimental effects of adolescent CORT treatment and acute 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonism on discrimination and reversal learning, respectively, we did not find evidence of additive deleterious effects of these two treatments. We therefore suggest that while disrupted serotonergic signalling is likely to be involved in the cognitive phenotype of OC-spectrum disorders, distinct neuropathological pathways may be at play in mediating the role of stress as an antecedent in OCD and related illnesses.",2024
Efficacy and safety of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists in augmentation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of moderate to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common mental disorder, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the cornerstone of its pharmacological treatment. About 40-60% of the cases are treatment-refractory, and this makes searching for second-line treatment necessary. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonists are among the many medications that have been used in augmentation with SSRIs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in augmentation with SSRIs in treating moderate to severe OCD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar for relevant trials published up to December 2022. The effect size was the mean difference in Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) scores before and after receiving 5-HT3 receptor antagonist drugs in augmentation with SSRIs in moderate to severe OCD patients. We included 6 randomized-controlled trails (RCTs) with 334 patients assessing the effect of the augmentation of SSRIs with ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron on treating moderate to severe OCD. Our results were in favor of the experimental group in total (Z = 8.37, P < 0.00001), in the compulsion subgroup (Z = 5.22, P < 0.00001), and in the obsession subgroup (Z = 8.33, P < 0.00001). They are well-tolerated, and have mild side effects and do not result in withdrawal. Augmentation of 5-HT3 antagonists with SSRIs can be beneficial in treating moderate to severe OCD. Further multi-center trials under adequate conditions in longer periods are needed to help come up with a comprehensive action plan.",2023
"A standardized Ashwagandha root extract alleviates stress, anxiety, and improves quality of life in healthy adults by modulating stress hormones: Results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a surge in stress, anxiety, and depression worldwide. Ashwagandha, an ayurvedic adaptogen has been traditionally used to manage stress, anxiety, and general well-being. We assessed the effect of Ashwagandha root extract (ARE-500 mg) standardized for 2.5% withanolides as per USP protocol with piperine (5 mg of 95% piperine) once daily for 60 days (12.5 mg withanolides/day) to alleviate stress and anxiety in healthy individuals with mild to moderate symptoms. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted for 60 days using ARE (n = 27) and placebo (n = 27) once daily at night at Narayana Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Bangalore, and Vijaya Super Specialty Hospital, Nellore, in India. The objectives of this study were to assess an improvement in perceived stress scale (PSS), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), quality of life (QOL), cognitive scores in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), changes in salivary cortisol, urinary serotonin, dopamine, serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) from baseline to end of the study. Safety was evaluated by laboratory parameters, and by monitoring any incidence of adverse events. 54 individuals were randomized and 50 of them completed the study. The PSS, GAD-7, and QOL scores improved significantly in all the participants taking ARE compared to the placebo. The CANTAB analysis revealed a significant improvement in multitasking, concentration, and decision taking time in ARE compared to placebo. ARE was also associated with a greater reduction in the morning salivary cortisol and an increase in urinary serotonin compared to placebo. Serum levels of NO, GSH, and MDA were not significantly different. Biochemical and hematological parameters remained in the normal range in all participants and ARE was well tolerated during the study. The results of the study suggest that ARE with 2.5% withanolides can effectively improve stress and anxiety by reducing cortisol and increasing serotonin in healthy individuals with mild to moderate symptoms.",2023
Structural and functional brain imaging after treatment with selective-serotonin reuptake-inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A mini review.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder whose etiopathogenesis, according to various neuroimaging studies, seems to be linked to selective dysfunctions in regions within the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuit. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line therapy for OCD but their neurobiological effects on the brain is only partially understood. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight structural and functional brain imaging modifications induced by SSRIs treatment. A literature search on PubMed, Psych-Info and Embase database was performed. Studies including patients with OCD that analyzed the effect of SSRIs through structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging were selected. Seven relevant studies were considered eligible for the present review. Overall, the results of the reviewed studies showed that SSRIs treatment seems to normalize structural, in terms of the white matter and gray matter volumes, and functional activity alterations observed in OCD patients, especially in regions within the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The poor design of the studies, the small and heterogeneous samples, differences in age, gender, illness course, comorbidities, treatment protocols and the different magnetic fields used make it difficult to generalize the results. From the available evidence it emerged that SSRIs treatment has proven to be effective in normalizing brain structural and functional alterations observed in OCD patients. However, future neuroimaging investigations should focus on long-term effects of drugs on brain structure and function in OCD patients through longitudinal approaches in order to identify more effective treatments for these patients.",2024
"Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.",2023
Effect of psilocybin on marble burying in ICR mice: role of 5-HT1A receptors and implications for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Preliminary clinical findings, supported by preclinical studies employing behavioral paradigms such as marble burying, suggest that psilocybin may be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the receptor mechanisms implicated in the putative anti-obsessional effect are not clear. On this background, we set out to explore (1) the role of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying; (2) the effect of staggered versus bolus psilocybin administration and persistence of the effect; (3) the effect of the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone, on marble-burying and the head twitch response (HTR) induced by psilocybin, a rodent correlate of psychedelic effects. Male ICR mice were administered psilocybin 4.4 mg/kg, escitalopram 5 mg/kg, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) 2 mg/kg, M100907 2 mg/kg, buspirone 5 mg/kg, WAY100635 2 mg/kg or combinations, intraperitoneally, and were tested on the marble burying test. HTR was examined in a magnetometer-based assay. The results show that (1) Psilocybin and escitalopram significantly reduced marble burying. The effect of psilocybin was not attenuated by the 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907. The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, reduced marble burying as did the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was additive to that of psilocybin, but that of buspirone was not. The 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone but not the effect of psilocybin. (2) Psilocybin injections over 3.5 h had no effect on marble burying and the effect of bolus injection was not persistent. (3) Co-administration of buspirone with psilocybin blocked its effect on HTR. These data suggest that neither 5-HT2A nor 5-HT1A receptors are pivotally implicated in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying. Co-administration with buspirone may block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin without impeding its anti-obsessional effects.",2023
Psychedelics as Transformative Therapeutics.,"Over the past decade, psychedelic compounds have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for a variety of intractable neuropsychiatric conditions. However, historically most of the basic science has utilized these compounds as probes to interrogate various endogenous neurotransmitter systems-mainly the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. With the renewed interest in utilizing these compounds as therapeutics and the explosion in clinical trials, psychedelics have been purported to treat many neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, cluster headaches, migraines, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is therefore imperative to understand the biology and pharmacology behind their therapeutic mechanisms as well as expose any potential pitfalls in their widespread use as treatments. This review covers the latest advances in understanding the biological mechanisms, the newest efforts in drug discovery, and potential pitfalls when it comes to utilizing this class of compounds as emerging therapeutics.",2023
The role of vitamin D in depression and anxiety disorders: a review of the literature.,"Prevalence of mental health disorders continue to increase worldwide. Over the past decades, suboptimal vitamin D (VD) levels and gut dysbiosis have been associated with neurological dysfunction and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we examined the available literature on VD and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, in both clinical and pre-clinical studies. Our extensive review failed to find a link between VD deficiency, depression, and anxiety-related behavior in preclinical animal models. However, strong evidence suggests that VD supplementation may alleviate symptoms in chronically stressed rodents, with some promising evidence from clinical studies. Further, fecal microbiota transplantations suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It has been postulated that serotonin, primarily produced by gut bacteria, may be a crucial factor. Hence, whether VD has the ability to impact gut microbiota and modulate serotonin synthesis warrants further investigation. Taken together, literature has suggested that VD may serve as a key regulator in the gut-brain axis to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inconsistent results of VD supplementation in clinical studies, particularly among VD deficient participants, suggests that current intake recommendations may need to be re-evaluated for individuals at-risk (i.e. prior to diagnosis) of developing depression and/or anxiety.",2024
Distinct serotonergic pathways to the amygdala underlie separate behavioral features of anxiety.,"Anxiety-like behaviors in mice include social avoidance and avoidance of bright spaces. Whether these features are distinctly regulated is unclear. We demonstrate that in mice, social and anxiogenic stimuli, respectively, increase and decrease serotonin (5-HT) levels in basal amygdala (BA). In dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), 5-HT∩vGluT3 neurons projecting to BA parvalbumin (DRN<sup>5-HT∩vGluT3</sup>-BA<sup>PV</sup>) and pyramidal (DRN<sup>5-HT∩vGluT3</sup>-BA<sup>Pyr</sup>) neurons have distinct intrinsic properties and gene expression and respond to anxiogenic and social stimuli, respectively. Activation of DRN<sup>5-HT∩vGluT3</sup>→BA<sup>PV</sup> inhibits 5-HT release via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on serotonergic terminals in BA, inducing social avoidance and avoidance of bright spaces. Activation of DRN<sup>5-HT∩vGluT3</sup>→BA neurons inhibits two subsets of BA<sup>Pyr</sup> neurons via 5-HT1A receptors (HTR1A) and 5-HT1B receptors (HTR1B). Pharmacological inhibition of HTR1A and HTR1B in BA induces avoidance of bright spaces and social avoidance, respectively. These findings highlight the functional significance of heterogenic inputs from DRN to BA subpopulations in the regulation of separate anxiety-related behaviors.",2022
Serotonin and dopamine transporter availability in social anxiety disorder after combined treatment with escitalopram and cognitive-behavioral therapy.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) are recommended treatments of social anxiety disorder (SAD), and often combined, but their effects on monoaminergic signaling are not well understood. In this multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) study, 24 patients with SAD were randomized to treatment with escitalopram+ICBT or placebo+ICBT under double-blind conditions. Before and after 9 weeks of treatment, patients were examined with positron emission tomography and the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I, probing the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporter proteins respectively. Both treatment combinations resulted in significant improvement as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). At baseline, SERT-DAT co-expression was high and, in the putamen and thalamus, co-expression showed positive associations with symptom severity. SERT-DAT co-expression was also predictive of treatment success, but predictor-outcome associations differed in direction between the treatments. After treatment, average SERT occupancy in the SSRI + ICBT group was >80%, with positive associations between symptom improvement and occupancy in the nucleus accumbens, putamen and anterior cingulate cortex. Following placebo+ICBT, SERT binding increased in the raphe nuclei. DAT binding increased in both groups in limbic and striatal areas, but relations with symptom improvement differed, being negative for SSRI + ICBT and positive for placebo + ICBT. Thus, serotonin-dopamine transporter co-expression exerts influence on symptom severity and remission rate in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. However, the monoamine transporters are modulated in dissimilar ways when cognitive-behavioral treatment is given concomitantly with either SSRI-medication or pill placebo.",2022
"Granisetron-mediated augmentation of sertraline therapeutic effect in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.","Medications currently recommended for the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) usually relieve the severity of symptoms by as much as 20-30%, and satisfactory treatment is obtained in 40-60% of patients with OCD. Nevertheless, the remaining symptoms continue to impair the patients' function. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate possible strategies to improve the mitigation of symptoms. In this study, the main objective was to examine and investigate the effectiveness of granisetron, which is a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) antagonist, as an adjunct therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for the purpose of ameliorating OCD symptoms. fifty-eight patients diagnosed with OCD, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, who had a Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) score of more than 21 were recruited in a double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 10 weeks to receive either granisetron (1 mg twice daily) and sertraline (100 mg daily initially followed by 200 mg daily after week 4) or placebo and sertraline. The primary outcome was OCD symptoms measured by the Y-BOCS. Y-BOCS total score significantly dropped in both groups (28.9 to 17.7 for granisetron plus sertraline and 27.5 to 19.3 for placebo plus sertraline group with a slightly greater drop for granisetron plus sertraline group), while the granisetron plus sertraline group experienced a significantly greater reduction in obsession scores (Greenhouse-Geisser F(2.32,97.57) = 4.52,p-value = 0.01). Moreover, in comparison with the placebo plus sertraline group, the proportion of the patients showing complete response was considerably higher among the granisetron plus sertraline group (P-value < 0.01). No major adverse effects were observed in any of the groups. The results suggest that granisetron augmentation of sertraline may increase the rate of response in patients with moderate to severe non-refractory OCD. Further studies are suggested in this regard.",2022
Chemical Modulators for Targeting Autism Spectrum Disorders: From Bench to Clinic.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by diverse behavioral symptoms such as repetitive behaviors, social deficits, anxiety, hyperactivity, and irritability. Despite their increasing incidence, the specific pathological mechanisms of ASD are still unknown, and the degree and types of symptoms that vary from patient to patient make it difficult to develop drugs that target the core symptoms of ASD. Although various atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants have been applied to regulate ASD symptoms, these drugs can only alleviate the symptoms and do not target the major causes. Therefore, development of novel drugs targeting factors directly related to the onset of ASD is required. Among the various factors related to the onset of ASD, several chemical modulators to treat ASD, focused on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and glutamate receptors, microbial metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines, are explored in this study. In particular, we focus on the chemical drugs that have improved various aspects of ASD symptoms in animal models and in clinical trials for various ages of patients with ASD.",2022

Concurrent anxiety in patients with major depression and cerebral serotonin 4 receptor binding. A NeuroPharm-1 study.,"Concurrent anxiety is frequent in major depressive disorder and a shared pathophysiological mechanism between anxiety and other depressive symptoms is plausible. The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT<sub>4</sub>R) has been implicated in both depression and anxiety. This is the first study to investigate the association between the cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding and anxiety in patients with depression before and after antidepressant treatment and the association to treatment response. Ninety-one drug-free patients with depression were positron emission tomography scanned with the 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]-SB207145. Depression severity and concurrent anxiety was measured at baseline and throughout 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Anxiety measures included four domains: anxiety/somatization factor score; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 10-items (GAD-10) score; anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7 (anxious depression) and syndromal anxious depression. Forty patients were rescanned at week 8. At baseline, we found a negative association between global 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding and both GAD-10 score (p < 0.01) and anxiety/somatization factor score (p = 0.06). Further, remitters had a higher baseline anxiety/somatization factor score compared with non-responders (p = 0.04). At rescan, patients with syndromal anxious depression had a greater change in binding relative to patients with non-syndromal depression (p = 0.04). Concurrent anxiety in patients with depression measured by GAD-10 score and anxiety/somatization factor score is negatively associated with cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding. A lower binding may represent a subtype with reduced natural resilience against anxiety in a depressed state, and concurrent anxiety may influence the effect on the 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R from serotonergic antidepressants. The 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R is a promising neuroreceptor for further understanding the underpinnings of concurrent anxiety in patients with depression.",2022
"Comparative effectiveness of cognitive behavioral treatment, serotonin, and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors for anxiety in children and adolescents: a network meta-analysis.","Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line treatments for childhood anxiety disorders (ADs). The objective of this current analysis was to conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two in treating pediatric ADs. The studies included consisted of randomized controlled trials evaluating non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. clomipramine), SSRIs, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, CBT, or a combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy. Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were 18 years or younger. A total of 86 studies were included, with a total of 7594 participants, of which 41.51% were females. For remission, all three treatments were significantly more effective than both placebo (ORs ranging from 0.07 and 0.18) and wait-list (ORs ranging from 0.06 and 0.16). In terms of the severity of anxiety symptoms, all treatment forms were significantly more effective for reducing anxiety than wait-list (standardized mean differences (SMDs) ranging from 0.98 and 2.91). Only pharmacotherapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo (SMD = 2.01, 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.01). Overall, the results demonstrate that CBT, pharmacotherapy, and their combination are effective treatments for childhood ADs. There was no significant difference between the three treatment forms. However, CBT was associated with lower attrition rates. CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two should all be considered to treat youths with ADs. However, potential risks and benefits should be considered before devising a treatment plan.",2023
Expectancy effects on serotonin and dopamine transporters during SSRI treatment of social anxiety disorder: a randomized clinical trial.,"It has been extensively debated whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more efficacious than placebo in affective disorders, and it is not fully understood how SSRIs exert their beneficial effects. Along with serotonin transporter blockade, altered dopamine signaling and psychological factors may contribute. In this randomized clinical trial of participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) we investigated how manipulation of verbally-induced expectancies, vital for placebo response, affect brain monoamine transporters and symptom improvement during SSRI treatment. Twenty-seven participants with SAD (17 men, 10 women), were randomized, to 9 weeks of overt or covert treatment with escitalopram 20 mg. The overt group received correct treatment information whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with escitalopram, described as an active placebo in a cover story. Before and after treatment, patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) assessments with the [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I radiotracers, probing brain serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporters. SAD symptoms were measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Overt was superior to covert SSRI treatment, resulting in almost a fourfold higher rate of responders. PET results showed that SERT occupancy after treatment was unrelated to anxiety reduction and equally high in both groups. In contrast, DAT binding decreased in the right putamen, pallidum, and the left thalamus with overt SSRI treatment, and increased with covert treatment, resulting in significant group differences. DAT binding potential changes in these regions correlated negatively with symptom improvement. Findings support that the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs involve psychological factors contingent on dopaminergic neurotransmission while serotonin transporter blockade alone is insufficient for clinical response.",2021

BDNF Overexpression in the Ventral Hippocampus Promotes Antidepressant- and Anxiolytic-Like Activity in Serotonin Transporter Knockout Rats.,"BDNF plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity events, vulnerability and resilience to stress-related disorders, being decreased in depressive patients and increased after antidepressant treatment. BDNF was found to be reduced in patients carrying the human polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The serotonin knockout rat (SERT<sup>-/-</sup>) is one of the animal models used to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression in humans. They present decreased BDNF levels, and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. To investigate whether upregulating BDNF would ameliorate the phenotype of SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats, we overexpressed BDNF locally into the ventral hippocampus and submitted the animals to behavioral testing. The results showed that BDNF overexpression in the vHIP of SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats promoted higher sucrose preference and sucrose intake; on the first day of the sucrose consumption test it decreased immobility time in the forced swim test and increased the time spent in the center of a novel environment. Furthermore, BDNF overexpression altered social behavior in SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats, which presented increased passive contact with test partner and decreased solitary behavior. Finally, it promoted decrease in plasma corticosterone levels 60 min after restraint stress. In conclusion, modulation of BDNF IV levels in the vHIP of SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats led to a positive behavioral outcome placing BDNF upregulation in the vHIP as a potential target to new therapeutic approaches to improve depressive symptoms.",2021
Association of polygenic score and the involvement of cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways with lithium treatment response in patients with bipolar disorder.,"Lithium is regarded as the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), a severe and disabling mental health disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. Nevertheless, lithium is not consistently effective, with only 30% of patients showing a favorable response to treatment. To provide personalized treatment options for bipolar patients, it is essential to identify prediction biomarkers such as polygenic scores. In this study, we developed a polygenic score for lithium treatment response (Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub>) in patients with BD. To gain further insights into lithium's possible molecular mechanism of action, we performed a genome-wide gene-based analysis. Using polygenic score modeling, via methods incorporating Bayesian regression and continuous shrinkage priors, Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> was developed in the International Consortium of Lithium Genetics cohort (ConLi<sup>+</sup>Gen: N = 2367) and replicated in the combined PsyCourse (N = 89) and BipoLife (N = 102) studies. The associations of Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> and lithium treatment response - defined in a continuous ALDA scale and a categorical outcome (good response vs. poor response) were tested using regression models, each adjusted for the covariates: age, sex, and the first four genetic principal components. Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05. Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> was positively associated with lithium treatment response in the ConLi<sup>+</sup>Gen cohort, in both the categorical (P = 9.8 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>12</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 1.9%) and continuous (P = 6.4 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>9</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 2.6%) outcomes. Compared to bipolar patients in the 1<sup>st</sup> decile of the risk distribution, individuals in the 10<sup>th</sup> decile had 3.47-fold (95%CI: 2.22-5.47) higher odds of responding favorably to lithium. The results were replicated in the independent cohorts for the categorical treatment outcome (P = 3.9 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>4</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9%), but not for the continuous outcome (P = 0.13). Gene-based analyses revealed 36 candidate genes that are enriched in biological pathways controlled by glutamate and acetylcholine. Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> may be useful in the development of pharmacogenomic testing strategies by enabling a classification of bipolar patients according to their response to treatment.",2023
Cholinergic regulation of mood: from basic and clinical studies to emerging therapeutics.,"Mood disorders are highly prevalent and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression remain poorly understood, although theories regarding dysfunction within various neurotransmitter systems have been postulated. Over 50 years ago, clinical studies suggested that increases in central acetylcholine could lead to depressed mood. Evidence has continued to accumulate suggesting that the cholinergic system has a important role in mood regulation. In particular, the finding that the antimuscarinic agent, scopolamine, exerts fast-onset and sustained antidepressant effects in depressed humans has led to a renewal of interest in the cholinergic system as an important player in the neurochemistry of major depression and bipolar disorder. Here, we synthesize current knowledge regarding the modulation of mood by the central cholinergic system, drawing upon studies from human postmortem brain, neuroimaging, and drug challenge investigations, as well as animal model studies. First, we describe an illustrative series of early discoveries which suggest a role for acetylcholine in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Then, we discuss more recent studies conducted in humans and/or animals which have identified roles for both acetylcholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in different mood states, and as targets for novel therapies.",2019
"Modeling bipolar disorder in mice by increasing acetylcholine or dopamine: chronic lithium treats most, but not all features.","Bipolar disorder (BD) is a disabling and life-threatening disease characterized by states of depression and mania. New and efficacious treatments have not been forthcoming partly due to a lack of well-validated models representing both facets of BD. We hypothesized that cholinergic- and dopaminergic-pharmacological manipulations would model depression and mania respectively, each attenuated by lithium treatment. C57BL/6 J mice received the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine or saline before testing for ""behavioral despair"" (immobility) in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST). Physostigmine effects on exploration and sensorimotor gating were assessed using the cross-species behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigms. Other C57BL/6 J mice received chronic lithium drinking water (300, 600, or 1200 mg/l) before assessing their effects alone in the BPM or with physostigmine on FST performance. Another group was tested with acute GBR12909 (dopamine transporter inhibitor) and chronic lithium (1000 mg/l) in the BPM. Physostigmine (0.03 mg/kg) increased immobility in the TST and FST without affecting activity, exploration, or PPI. Lithium (600 mg/l) resulted in low therapeutic serum concentrations and normalized the physostigmine-increased immobility in the FST. GBR12909 induced mania-like behavior in the BPM of which hyper-exploration was attenuated, though not reversed, after chronic lithium (1000 mg/ml). Increased cholinergic levels induced depression-like behavior and hyperdopaminergia induced mania-like behavior in mice, while chronic lithium treated some, but not all, facets of these effects. These data support a cholinergic-monoaminergic mechanism for modeling BD aspects and provide a way to assess novel therapeutics.",2015
The catecholaminergic-cholinergic balance hypothesis of bipolar disorder revisited.,"Bipolar disorder is a unique illness characterized by fluctuations between mood states of depression and mania. Originally, an adrenergic-cholinergic balance hypothesis was postulated to underlie these different affective states. In this review, we update this hypothesis with recent findings from human and animal studies, suggesting that a catecholaminergic-cholinergic hypothesis may be more relevant. Evidence from neuroimaging studies, neuropharmacological interventions, and genetic associations support the notion that increased cholinergic functioning underlies depression, whereas increased activations of the catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) underlie mania. Elevated functional acetylcholine during depression may affect both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in a compensatory fashion. Increased functional dopamine and norepinephrine during mania on the other hand may affect receptor expression and functioning of dopamine reuptake transporters. Despite increasing evidence supporting this hypothesis, a relationship between these two neurotransmitter systems that could explain cycling between states of depression and mania is missing. Future studies should focus on the influence of environmental stimuli and genetic susceptibilities that may affect the catecholaminergic-cholinergic balance underlying cycling between the affective states. Overall, observations from recent studies add important data to this revised balance theory of bipolar disorder, renewing interest in this field of research.",2015
Neuromodulation by acetylcholine: examples from schizophrenia and depression.,"The contribution of acetylcholine to psychiatric illnesses remains an area of active research. For example, increased understanding of mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of cortical function has provided insight into attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia. Acetylcholine normally enhances cortical sensitivity to external stimuli and decreases corticocortical communication, increasing focused attention; however, increases in ACh signaling can lead to symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For example, while stress-induced ACh release can result in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, chronic elevations in cholinergic signaling may produce maladaptive behaviors. Here, we review several innovations in human imaging, molecular genetics and physiological control of circuits that have begun to identify mechanisms linking altered cholinergic neuromodulation to schizophrenia and depression.",2014
The role of the aminergic systems in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.,"Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major medical and social burden, but little is known about the specific pathophysiology of BPD. The key biogenic amines in the aminergic system include serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh). By analyzing these neurotransmitters, this chapter highlights three hypotheses in the pathophysiology of BPD: the biogenic amine hypothesis, the cholinergic-aminergic balance hypothesis, and the permissive hypothesis. Evidence from select studies of cerebrospinal fluid, postmortem subjects, neuroimaging, genetic factors, and pharmacological agents will be used to reconcile these hypotheses. Possible explanations for discrepancies in these hypotheses are given, and directions for future studies are suggested.",2011
Muscarinic receptors in psychiatric disorders - can we mimic 'health'?,"The concept that acetylcholine is involved in the pathophysiologies of psychiatric disorders has existed since the 1950s. There is very strong evidence implicating a dysfunctional muscarinic system in schizophrenia, +with less information available for bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. The translation of this evidence into clinically viable treatments has been disappointing; hampered by problems associated with developing drugs that target the requisite members of the muscarinic family, rather than all of the receptors, which results in unacceptable side-effect profiles. The discovery of additional binding sites, other than the one occupied by acetylcholine, has revitalised research into this aspect of psychopharmacology. New compounds are now being developed that have the potential to selectively target individual muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system. The question that remains to be answered is whether stimulating central muscarinic receptors will result in the reestablishment of normal central muscarinic activity? The purpose of this review is to (i) summarise the data supporting a role of the muscarinic system in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, and (ii) give an overview of some of the new selective muscarinic ligands that are currently in development and try to address the issue of re-establishing appropriate central muscarinic function.",2009
Differential effect of serum from bipolar versus schizophrenic patients on spontaneous acetylcholine release at mammalian neuromuscular junction.,"The diagnosis of bipolar disease frequently requires a long time since the age of onset, especially because the disease is misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. The aim of the present work was to investigate whether sera from bipolar patients have an active substance that allows making a fast identification of the disease. Sera from healthy volunteers, euthymic and non-stabilized bipolar patients, and schizophrenic patients were passively transferred into CF1 mice and after 2 day injections, MEPP frequency from diaphragm muscles was recorded. The same procedure was performed with sera fraction of high and low MW (cut-off 3000). Sera from non-stabilized bipolar patients induced a decreased MEPP frequency and occluded the presynaptic inhibitory effect of the specific adenosine A(1) receptor agonist 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CCPA) in the recipient mice, while in the euthymic bipolar group spontaneous secretion reached control values although the action of CCPA was still prevented. Similar results were obtained with low MW sera fraction from euthymic and non-stabilized bipolar patients. The addition of adenosine deaminase to the sera fraction prevented the modification of spontaneous ACh release. In mice injected with sera from schizophrenic patients, MEPP frequency was within control values and CCPA induced its typical inhibitory action. These results indicate that bipolar patients contain in their blood an active substance compatible with adenosine, which was able to modify spontaneous ACh release in the recipient mice. This effect was not observed with sera from healthy volunteers and schizophrenic patients. The increase of adenosine concentration may result from synaptic hyperactivity that presumably plays a role in the symptoms of bipolar disorder and/or may derive from peripheral cells through a more general mechanism. The different results obtained with bipolar and schizophrenic sera raise the possibility that the passive transfer model could be used as a diagnostic test in the future.",2006
Reduced muscarinic type 2 receptor binding in subjects with bipolar disorder.,"A variety of indirect evidence has implicated the central muscarinic-cholinergic system, and more specifically the type 2 muscarinic (M2) receptor, in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms arising in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. To assess the binding potential of muscarinic2 receptors in vivo during depression in subjects with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. The M2 receptor binding was compared between unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder during depression vs healthy controls, using positron emission tomography and [18F]FP-TZTP (fluorodopa F 18 [3-(3-[3-fluoroproply]thio)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine), a selective M2 receptor radioligand. Outpatients at the National Institutes of Health. Unmedicated subjects with current depression meeting DSM-IV criteria for either major depressive disorder (n = 17) or bipolar disorder (n = 16) and 23 healthy control subjects. The primary outcome parameter was [(18)F]FP-TZTP distribution volume, which is proportional to the product of receptor density and affinity and, in the case of [(18)F]FP-TZTP, is known to be sensitive to endogenous acetylcholine concentrations. The relationship between illness severity, as rated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating scales, and distribution volume also was assessed. The mean anterior cingulate cortex distribution volume differed across groups (F55 = 3.4; P = .04), and this difference was accounted for by significantly lower binding in bipolar disorder compared with both major depressive disorder and control groups. The mean M2 receptor binding in subjects with bipolar disorder was reduced relative to both healthy controls and subjects with major depressive disorder, to an extent that correlated with depressive symptoms. The reduction in the bipolar disorder group could be accounted for either by a reduction in M2 receptor density or affinity or an elevation in endogenous acetylcholine levels. To our knowledge, these data provide the first direct evidence that altered M2 receptor function contributes to mood dysregulation in bipolar disorder.",2006
Kindling and second messengers: an approach to the neurobiology of recurrence in bipolar disorder.,"Since bipolar disorder is inherently a longitudinal illness characterized by recurrence and cycling of mood episodes, neurobiological theories involving kindlinglike phenomena appear to possess a certain explanatory power. An approach to understanding kindlinglike phenomena at the molecular level has been made possible by advances in research on second-messenger systems in the brain. The time frame of interest has shifted from the microseconds of presynaptic events to hours, days, months, and even years in the longer duration of events beyond the synapse--through second messengers, gene regulation, and synthesis of long-acting trophic factors. These complex interlocking systems may explain how environmental stress could interact over time with genetic vulnerability to produce illness. In its two sections, this paper will review an approach to understanding two major aspects of the neurobiology of bipolar disorder: kindling phenomena and second-messenger mechanisms. We will suggest that these two fields of research together help explain the biology of recurrence.",1999
The neurochemistry of mania: a hypothesis of etiology and rationale for treatment.,"1. The author delineates the emergence of an important concept in the Neurochemistry of mental illness, that of a Cholinergic Factor in Mania. This concept which evolved steadily over a period of 22 years from 1950-1972, the author believes has given us our first significant insight into the etiology and treatment of the Manic state. 2. In addition, the author examines the Adrenergic-Cholinergic hypothesis of Mania and Depression and the Brain Cholinergic-Adrenergic Balance hypothesis for Mania and Schizophrenia. 3. Also described in this article are some successful preliminary attempts by others, to treat Mania with Phosphatidyl Choline and the author will present, for the first time, data relating to success with the use of Phosphatidyl Choline in bringing about permanent remission of mania in 10 treatment subjects since 1983. 4. In conclusion the author proposes a Cholinergic Insufficiency Hypothesis as a primary factor in the causation of Mania and comments on a presumptive role in the modulation and balance of Adrenergic Dominance by Presynaptic Receptors positioned on the Nerve Terminals of Adrenergic Neurons.",1990
Is there a common denominator for the antimanic effect of lithium and anticonvulsants?,"Starting from the idea that different primary actions of carbamazepine, valproate and lithium might converge into a similar secondary mechanism of action, e.g. a modulation of the functioning of certain transmitter systems, a review of the literature was made on the effects of these and related substances on GABAergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission, in an attempt to find a common denominator. It was concluded that similarities of the effects of these drugs are most evident with respect to a reduction of dopaminergic transmission. Some similarities also exist with respect to GABAergic and, to a lesser degree, cholinergic transmission. The effects on noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission seem too disparate to be considered as a potential basis for the antimanic effects of these drugs.",1987
[Current hypotheses on the mechanism of action of lithium. I. Lithium and neuromediators].,"This paper intends to survey, clarify and organize the recent advances of research on the central action mechanism of lithium. A brief introduction relates the cation's ""medical history"" and analyses the evolution of what is known and hypothesized about various categories of psychotropics. In this article the metabolism of neuromediators and its disturbances are the subject of a detailed study. First reviewed is recent work concerning the aminergic theories of depression. Most of the other neuromediator systems are the subject of specific research projects and of these, the GABAergic hypothesis seems the most promising to date.",1987
GABA and circadian timekeeping: implications for manic-depression and sleep disorders.,"Circadian rhythms, evident in a wide variety of physiological and behavioural parameters, are under the control of central neural pacemakers, the best characterized of which is the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The neurophysiological mechanisms involved in central pacemaker function are unknown. Recent biochemical, pharmacological and behavioural evidence suggests that the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), present in the small interneurones of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, plays an important role in circadian timekeeping. This has enabled the formulation of strategies for treatment of patients with manic depressive illness and certain sleep disorders in which disorders of circadian timekeeping may be fundamental.",1986

Dopamine in manic depressive illness. A pharmacological synthesis.,"If the clinical symptoms of mania are a consequence of increased activity in central dopaminergic (DA) pathways in predisposed individuals, then drugs increasing DA neurotransmission should precipitate or exacerbate mania in such people, whereas drugs which reduce DA neurotransmission should ameliorate manic symptoms. Of the drugs which enhance DA neurotransmission, those which increase synthesis of DA (levodopa), those which promote DA release (amphetamine), and those which act directly as agonists or DA receptors (bromocriptine) have all been shown to precipitate mania. Conversely, drugs which reduce DA neurotransmission by inhibiting synthesis (alpha-methylparatyrosine) or by blocking DA receptors (pimozide) are effective in reducing manic symptoms. DA systems are not working in isolation; evidence is presented showing an influence on manic illness of central cholinergic and GABA-ergic processes. It is suggested that there is an interacting set of neurotransmitter pathways linking the limbic system and the ventral tegmental (A10) area involving DA, acetylcholine and GABA upon which drugs can act to influence the course of a manic illness.",1985
Adrenergic-cholinergic balance and the treatment of affective disorders.,"Centrally acting cholinomimetic drugs cause anergia, behavioral inhibition and depression. Centrally acting cholinomimetic drugs have antimanic properties. Combinations of acetylcholine precursors and centrally active cholinomimetic agents may cause augmented muscarinic effects, as may a combination of an antiadrenergic and cholinomimetic drugs. Centrally active anticholinergic agents may exert antidepressant effects. Affective disorder patients may show hyperreactivity to cholinomimetic agents, a phenomena which may have diagnostic significance.",1983
The use of cholinergic precursors in neuropsychiatric diseases.,"Preclinical data suggest that cholinergic precursors such as choline or lecithin, increase levels of acetylcholine in specific brain structures, and under certain conditions may enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. A variety of neuropsychiatric diseases including tardive dyskinesia. Huntington's chorea, ataxias, Tourette's syndrome, schizophrenia, affective illness, and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, has been implicated with a general underactivity of central cholinergic mechanisms. Recent studies have investigated the possibility that cholinergic precursor loading strategies may provide viable treatments for these disorders of presumed cholinergic underactivity. Extensive data demonstrate that the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia can be reduced by choline or lecithin, whereas investigations in other disorders have met with mild success, at best, or are still in preliminary stages. Further controlled studies with choline or lecithin using broader dose ranges, longer durations of treatment, and concomitant administration of agents which may increase the release of acetylcholine are warranted.",1982
Cholinergic regulation of mood and REM sleep: potential model and marker of vulnerability to affective disorder.,"To test the hypothesis that depression and REM sleep share common cholinergic mechanisms the authors administered arecoline 25 min after completion of the first REM period to 14 patients with remitted bipolar affective disorder, 15 normal controls, and 5 subjects with a personal or family history of affective disorder. The second REM period occurred significantly sooner in the remitted patients than in the normal controls. The patients also had a significantly higher density of eye movements during the first REM period and a higher percentage of REM sleep. The authors believe that increased cholinergic sensitivity and REM density may be biological markers of increased vulnerability to bipolar affective illness.",1982
Manic depression--a disorder of central dopaminergic rhythm.,"Starting from the fact that there are abnormal sweat K+ /Na+ ratios in both manics and depressives an attempt has been made to explain manic depression in terms of a disorder of the circadian rhythm of the adrenal glands. This, in turn, it is suggested, is caused by a defective circadian rhythm of central dopamine brought about by its having an abnormal response to ambient temperature change.",1981
Pharmacological investigations of the cholinergic imbalance hypotheses of movement disorders and psychosis.,"The hypotheses of relative cholinergic underactivity in Huntington's disease, tardive dyskinesia, mania, and schizophrenia were pharmacologically investigated, using physostigmine and choline chloride. Intravenous physostigmine improved the involuntary movements of all of four patients with tardive dyskinesia and three of six patients with Huntington's disease. Physostigmine infusion also decreased manic symptoms in six of nine patients with mania, but had no beneficial effects in three patients with schizophrenia. Precursorloading with choline chloride may increase brain acetylcholine levels and central cholinergic activity. In patients with movement disorders a transient improvement during physostigmine infusion predicted a positive response to a trial of oral choline chloride. One manic patient may have been improved by choline chloride, however choline chloride did not improve symptoms in four of six schizophrenix patients. Chronic treatment with oral choline chloride increases plasma levels of choline during administration and for approximately 48 hr after discontinuation of treatment. A single 5-g dose of choline chloride also transiently raises plasma choline levels. These results with physostigmine support the hypotheses of cholinergic underactivity in Huntington's disease, tardive dyskinesia, and mania. Agents which might chronically increase cholinergic activity such as choline chloride should be further tested in these disorders.",1978
Treatment approaches to mania.,"Treatment of manic episodes is an urgency because of the lack of insight and excessive psychomotor activity. Over the past two decades various new modes of pharmacological treatment of this condition has been reported. Along with them, biochemical findings in manic patients have been exhaustively investigated. Etiologically based pharmacological treatment of manic episodes will help us therapeutically in improving the condition of the patient and scientifically, to confirm or explore biochemical basis of manic episodes. The new innovative approaches for the treatment of manic episodes need to be applied in treating therapy-resistant patients. Included in this paper are treatment approaches based on norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid and permissive hypothesis, peripheral autonomic imbalance, endocrine abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, paradoxical response, and cyclic AMP. In addition, use of antidepressants and pyrotherapy is described.",1976
[Mechanism of action of lithium in manic-depressive psychoses: current research results].,"The mechanism of action lithium in the treatment of manic-depressive illness is far from being known. A great progress will be achieved when it is known wherther lithium has an actual anti-depressive action, which implies to determine whether all the ""endogenous"" depressive states belong to the same pathogenic group. Lithium salts have a real therapeutic action on manic states which may be put together with the decrease of available Norepinephrine that lithium salts bring about on cerebral receptors. This decrease concords with the aminergic theory of affective disorders. Many actions of lithium salts on the physiologic systems have been brought to evidence but the uncertainties that remain concerning their interactions prevent us to formulate any coherent assumption.",1976

Plausible therapeutic effects of melatonin and analogs in the dopamine-associated pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a significant neuropsychiatric condition characterized by marked psychological mood disturbances. Despite extensive research on the symptomatology of BD, the mechanisms underlying its development and presentation remain unknown. Consequently, potential treatments are limited, and existing medications often cause significant side effects, leading to treatment discontinuation. Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in behavioral regulation, reward systems, and mood, highlighting the importance of the dopaminergic system in BD. Elevated levels of DA and tyrosine hydroxylase are associated with the onset of manic episodes, whereas reduced levels are linked to the depressive phase. Additionally, endogenous melatonin (MEL) levels are considerably lower in patients with BD. When administered as a treatment, exogenous MEL and MEL agonists improve behavioral characteristics and significantly modulate DA-related pathophysiological pathways in BD, with minimal adverse effects achieved through MEL receptor activation. Moreover, MEL and MEL agonists offer neuroprotection by promoting physiological homeostasis during disruption. The aim of this review is to investigate and propose MEL receptors as potential novel therapeutic targets for BD. This review seeks to analyze the role of MEL and its agonists in modulating dopamine-related pathophysiological pathways, improving behavioral outcomes, and providing neuroprotection with minimal side effects.",2025
Mesolimbic dopamine neurons drive infradian rhythms in sleep-wake and heightened activity state.,"Infradian mood and sleep-wake rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond have been observed in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which even persist in the absence of exogenous timing cues, indicating an endogenous origin. Here, we show that mice exposed to methamphetamine in drinking water develop infradian locomotor rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond which extend to sleep length and manic state-associated behaviors in support of a model for cycling in BD. The cycling capacity is abrogated upon genetic disruption of dopamine (DA) production in DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or ablation of nucleus accumbens projecting DA neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of <sup>VTA</sup>DA neurons including those that project to the nucleus accumbens led to locomotor period lengthening in circadian clock-deficient mice, which was counteracted by antipsychotic treatment. Together, our findings argue that BD cycling relies on infradian rhythm generation that depends on mesolimbic DA neurons.",2025
The dopamine transporter inhibition using GBR 12909 as a novel pharmacological tool to assess bipolar disorder-like neurobehavioral phenotypes in zebrafish.,"Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in brain physiology. Changes in DA-mediated signaling have been implicated with the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric conditions. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder, characterized by alterning between manic/hypomanic and depressive mood. In experimental research, the pharmacological inhibition of DA reuptake using GBR 12909 serves as a tool to elicit BD-like phenotypes. Alternative model organisms, such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio), have been considered important systems for investigating the neurobehavioral changes involved in different neuropsychiatric conditions, including BD. Here, we discuss the use of GBR 12909 as a novel pharmacological strategy to mimic BD-like phenotypes in zebrafish models. We also emphasize the well-conserved DA-mediated signaling in zebrafish and the early expression of dopaminergic biomarkers in the brain, especially focusing on dopamine transporter (DAT), the main target of GBR 12909. Finally, we discuss potential advantages and limitations in the field, the perspectives of using GBR 12909 in BD research, and how distinct validation criteria (i.e., face, predictive, and construct validity) can be assessed in translational approaches using zebrafish-based models.",2025
Impact of Serotonin Deficiency on Circadian Dopaminergic Rhythms.,"Physiology and behavior are structured temporally to anticipate daily cycles of light and dark, ensuring fitness and survival. Neuromodulatory systems in the brain-including those involving serotonin and dopamine-exhibit daily oscillations in neural activity and help shape circadian rhythms. Disrupted neuromodulation can cause circadian abnormalities that are thought to underlie several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar mania and schizophrenia, for which a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we show that genetically depleting serotonin in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice promotes manic-like behaviors and disrupts daily oscillations of the dopamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in midbrain dopaminergic nuclei. Specifically, while TH mRNA and protein levels in the Substantia Nigra (SN) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of wild-type mice doubled between the light and dark phase, TH levels were high throughout the day in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice, suggesting a hyperdopaminergic state. Analysis of TH expression in striatal terminal fields also showed blunted rhythms. Additionally, we found low abundance and blunted rhythmicity of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (Cck) in the VTA of knockout mice, a neuropeptide whose downregulation has been implicated in manic-like states in both rodents and humans. Altogether, our results point to a previously unappreciated serotonergic control of circadian dopamine signaling and propose serotonergic dysfunction as an upstream mechanism underlying dopaminergic deregulation and ultimately maladaptive behaviors.",2024
Anti-manic effect of deep brain stimulation of the ventral tegmental area in an animal model of mania induced by methamphetamine.,"Treatment of refractory bipolar disorder (BD) is extremely challenging. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) holds promise as an effective treatment intervention. However, we still understand very little about the mechanisms of DBS and its application on BD. The present study aimed to investigate the behavioural and neurochemical effects of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DBS in an animal model of mania induced by methamphetamine (m-amph). Wistar rats were given 14 days of m-amph injections, and on the last day, animals were submitted to 20 min of VTA DBS in two different patterns: intermittent low-frequency stimulation (LFS) or continuous high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Immediately after DBS, manic-like behaviour and nucleus accumbens (NAc) phasic dopamine (DA) release were evaluated in different groups of animals through open-field tests and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Levels of NAc dopaminergic markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. M-amph induced hyperlocomotion in the animals and both DBS parameters reversed this alteration. M-amph increased DA reuptake time post-sham compared to baseline levels, and both LFS and HFS were able to block this alteration. LFS was also able to reduce phasic DA release when compared to baseline. LFS was able to increase dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in the NAc. These results demonstrate that both VTA LFS and HFS DBS exert anti-manic effects and modulation of DA dynamics in the NAc. More specifically the increase in DA reuptake driven by increased DAT expression may serve as a potential mechanism by which VTA DBS exerts its anti-manic effects.",2024
Association of neurotransmitter pathway polygenic risk with specific symptom profiles in psychosis.,"A primary goal of psychiatry is to better understand the pathways that link genetic risk to psychiatric symptoms. Here, we tested association of diagnosis and endophenotypes with overall and neurotransmitter pathway-specific polygenic risk in patients with early-stage psychosis. Subjects included 205 demographically diverse cases with a psychotic disorder who underwent comprehensive psychiatric and neurological phenotyping and 115 matched controls. Following genotyping, we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS summary statistics. To test if overall genetic risk can be partitioned into affected neurotransmitter pathways, we calculated pathway PGSs (pPGSs) for SZ risk affecting each of four major neurotransmitter systems: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Psychosis subjects had elevated SZ PGS versus controls; cases with SZ or BP diagnoses had stronger SZ or BP risk, respectively. There was no significant association within psychosis cases between individual symptom measures and overall PGS. However, neurotransmitter-specific pPGSs were moderately associated with specific endophenotypes; notably, glutamate was associated with SZ diagnosis and with deficits in cognitive control during task-based fMRI, while dopamine was associated with global functioning. Finally, unbiased endophenotype-driven clustering identified three diagnostically mixed case groups that separated on primary deficits of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognitive control. All clusters showed strong genome-wide risk. Cluster 2, characterized by deficits in cognitive control and negative symptoms, additionally showed specific risk concentrated in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Due to the intensive characterization of our subjects, the present study was limited to a relatively small cohort. As such, results should be followed up with additional research at the population and mechanism level. Our study suggests pathway-based PGS analysis may be a powerful path forward to study genetic mechanisms driving psychiatric endophenotypes.",2024
Association Between Bipolar Disorder and Parkinson's Disease.,"Bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease are two distinct neurological conditions that share common features related to dopaminergic dysfunction. This article presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature to investigate the association between bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease, focusing on the dopaminergic hypothesis and potential therapeutic options. The dopaminergic hypothesis suggests that both bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease involve impairments in the nigrostriatal or mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways. Studies have demonstrated alterations in dopamine regulation during manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder. Similarly, Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in motor symptoms. Recent analyses have highlighted a predisposition to Parkinson's disease in individuals with bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease in patients with bipolar disorder. However, differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from parkinsonism induced by medications used in bipolar disorder can be challenging. Dopamine transporter (DAT) scans can aid in making a differential diagnosis. Treatment options for patients with both bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease are limited. Neuroleptics, commonly used to manage psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease, may worsen motor symptoms and have limitations in bipolar disorder patients. Clozapine has shown efficacy in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms. Pimavanserin, an inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor can offer new opportunities. However, its efficacy in bipolar disorder patients with Parkinson's disease remains unexplored. In conclusion, the association between bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease is supported by the involvement of the dopaminergic system in both conditions. The identification of shared mechanisms opens new avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy of pimavanserin and explore other treatment options for individuals with both bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease.",2023
Social cognitive deficit is associated with visuomotor coordination impairment and dopamine transporter availability in euthymic bipolar disorder.,"Extensive evidence has suggested functional connections between co-occurring visuomotor and social cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders; however, such association has not been studied in bipolar disorder (BD). We aimed to investigate the relationship between visuomotor coordination and social cognition in the euthymic stage of BD (euBD). Given the shared neurobiological underpinnings involving the dopaminergic system and corticostriatal circuitry, we hypothesized a positive correlation between social cognition and visuomotor coordination in euBD patients. 40 euBD patients and 59 healthy control (HC) participants underwent evaluation of social (Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Taiwan version (DANVA-2-TW)), non-social cognitive function and visuomotor coordination. A subgroup of participants completed single-photon emission computed tomography for striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability assessment. EuBD patients showed impaired nonverbal emotion recognition (ps ≤ 0.033) and poorer visuomotor coordination (ps < 0.003) compared to HC, with a positive correlation between these two abilities (r = 0.55, p < 0.01). However, after considering potential confounding factors, instead of visuomotor coordination, striatal DAT availability was a unique predictor of emotion recognition accuracy in euBD (beta = 0.33, p = 0.001). Our study result supported a functional association between social cognition and visuomotor coordination in euBD, with striatal dopaminergic dysfunction emerged as a crucial contributing factor in their interrelation.",2023
Evaluating lumateperone for its use in treating depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder in adults.,"Lumateperone is a novel antipsychotic medication that has recently received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of major depressive episodes of type I and II bipolar disorder. It is approved for use as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproic acid. Clinical trials performed with lumateperone for bipolar disorder were reviewed. Additionally, pharmacodynamic actions of lumateperone are reviewed. Lumateperone is superior to placebo whether used alone or in combination with a mood stabilizer in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder. It achieves this effect with minimal dopamine blockade-related side effects due to less than 50% dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. While the pharmacodynamic profile of lumateperone is unique, the mechanism of action in bipolar depression remains obscure. Lumateperone is an antipsychotic with full antagonist effects at the post-synaptic D2, and partial agonist effects at the presynaptic D2. This unique profile allows for both antipsychotic and antidepressant effects at the same dose, which does not produce dopamine-related side effects. Consequently, lumateperone is exceptionally well tolerated compared to other antidepressant-acting antipsychotic agents. It is now the only agent approved as an adjunct to the mood stabilizer for bipolar II depression.",2023
Mood and behavior regulation: interaction of lithium and dopaminergic system.,"Lithium is one of the most effect mood-stabilizing drugs prescribed especially for bipolar disorder. Lithium has wide range effects on different molecular factors and neural transmission including dopaminergic signaling. On the other hand, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic signaling is significantly involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review article aims to study lithium therapeutic mechanisms, dopaminergic signaling, and the interaction of lithium and dopamine. We concluded that acute and chronic lithium treatments often reduce dopamine synthesis and level in the brain. However, some studies have reported conflicting results following lithium treatment, especially chronic treatment. The dosage, duration, and type of lithium administration, and the brain region selected for measuring dopamine level were not significant differences in different chronic treatments used in previous studies. It was suggested that lithium has various mechanisms affecting dopaminergic signaling and mood, and that many molecular factors can be involved, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), β-catenin, protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). Thus, molecular effects of lithium can be the most important mechanisms of lithium that also alter neural transmissions including dopaminergic signaling in mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways.",2023
Neural progenitor cells derived from lithium responsive and non-responsive bipolar disorder patients exhibit distinct sensitivity to cell death following methamphetamine.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by manic and depressive mood episodes and loss of brain gray matter. Lithium has antimanic and neuroprotective properties, but only 30% BD patients respond to lithium pharmacotherapy. Dopamine signaling has been implicated in BD and may contribute to lithium response. Methamphetamine (METH) stimulates dopamine release and models the clinical features of mania but has never been used to study cell death in BD patient neurons. We used BD patient derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) to determine whether the vulnerability to cell death differed in samples from lithium responder (Li-R) and non-responder (Li-NR) BD patients and healthy controls following METH exposure in vitro. We hypothesized that NPCs from Li-R and Li-NR would differ in vulnerability to METH, dopamine signaling and neuroprotection from lithium. Following METH, NPCs from controls and Li-NR showed significantly greater cell loss compared to Li-R. Pre-treatment of NPCs with the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 reversed the neurotoxic effects of METH. In Li-R NPCs, expression of phosho-ERK1/2 was significantly increased. In Li-NR NPCs, phospho-AKT, D1 and D2 dopamine receptor proteins were significantly increased. Pre-treatment of NPCs with lithium before METH reversed the neurotoxic effects of METH in control NPCs, whereas Li-NR showed less protective benefit. Li-R cells showed decreased levels of cell death after METH and comparatively high viability, and lithium treatment did not increase viability any further. This novel NPC model of mania reveals differences in cell death that could help identify mechanisms of lithium response in BD.",2023
"Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Cariprazine in Pediatric Patients with Bipolar I Disorder or Schizophrenia.","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Cariprazine is a dopamine D<sub>3</sub>-preferring D<sub>3</sub>/D<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist approved to treat adults with schizophrenia and manic/mixed or depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. This sequential-cohort, dose-escalation study was the first to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profile of cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, desmethyl-cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl-cariprazine (DDCAR), in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This phase I open-label study enrolled patients with schizophrenia (13-17 years of age) or bipolar I disorder (10-17 years of age). Patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and had Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores ≥70 or Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores ≥20. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups to receive 6 weeks of cariprazine treatment through slow titration to 1.5, 3, or 4.5 mg/d or fast titration to 4.5 mg/d. Pharmacokinetics, adverse events (AEs), and various safety parameters were analyzed. Efficacy was evaluated as an exploratory outcome. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 50 participants were enrolled. Based on mean trough levels, steady state appeared to be reached within 1-2 weeks for cariprazine and DCAR and within 4-5 weeks for DDCAR. Systemic exposure of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR generally increased approximately in proportion to the increases in dose from 1.5 to 4.5 mg/d. The most frequent treatment-related, treatment-emergent AEs included sedation, parkinsonism, tremor, dystonia, and blurred vision. Improvements from baseline on the PANSS and YMRS were observed throughout treatment. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In this first investigation of cariprazine in a pediatric population with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with those observed in adults.

Biomarker potential of hsa-miR-145-5p in peripheral whole blood of manic bipolar I patients.,"Bipolar I disorder (BD-I) is a type of bipolar spectrum disorder characterized by manic or mixed episodes. Detecting microRNA regulations as epigenetic actors in BD-I is important to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and reveal the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers. We evaluated the expression profile of six candidate miRNAs (hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-376a-3p, hsa-miR-3680-5p, hsa-miR-4253-5p, hsa-miR-4482-3p, and hsa-miR-4725) in patients with BD-I and in healthy controls (aged 11-50 years). We also determined the potential target genes of these miRNAs through in silico analysis. The diagnostic values of the miRNAs were calculated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Four miRNAs were upregulated (hsa-miR-376a-3p, hsa-miR-3680-5p, hsa-miR-4253-5p, hsa-miR-4482-3p) and hsa-miR-145-5p was downregulated in patients (p < 0.001). The target gene analyses showed that hsa-miR-145-5p specifically targets the dopamine decarboxylase (DDC) gene. The area under the curve of hsa-miR-145-5p was 0.987. Differential expression of five miRNAs in peripheral blood may be associated with the pathogenesis of BD-I, and hsa-miR-145-5p has potential as a BD-I biomarker. This miRNA can be used in dopamine-serotonin regulation and dose adjustment in drug therapy via the DDC gene.",2022

Therapeutic Interventions to Mitigate Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress-Induced Damage in Patients with Bipolar Disorder.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by mood changes, including recurrent manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes, which may involve mixed symptoms. Despite the progress in neurobiological research, the pathophysiology of BD has not been extensively described to date. Progress in the understanding of the neurobiology driving BD could help facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and biomarkers for its early detection. Oxidative stress (OS), which damages biomolecules and causes mitochondrial and dopamine system dysfunctions, is a persistent finding in patients with BD. Inflammation and immune dysfunction might also play a role in BD pathophysiology. Specific nutrient supplements (nutraceuticals) may target neurobiological pathways suggested to be perturbed in BD, such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and OS. Consequently, nutraceuticals may be used in the adjunctive treatment of BD. This paper summarizes the possible roles of OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune system dysregulation in the onset of BD. It then discusses OS-mitigating strategies that may serve as therapeutic interventions for BD. It also analyzes the relationship between diet and BD as well as the use of nutritional interventions in the treatment of BD. In addition, it addresses the use of lithium therapy; novel antipsychotic agents, including clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, cariprazine, and quetiapine; and anti-inflammatory agents to treat BD. Furthermore, it reviews the efficacy of the most used therapies for BD, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, imagery-focused cognitive therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. A better understanding of the roles of OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, along with a stronger elucidation of the therapeutic functions of antioxidants, antipsychotics, anti-inflammatory agents, lithium therapy, and light therapies, may lead to improved strategies for the treatment and prevention of bipolar disorder.",2022
Comprehensive exploration of the genetic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways to psychiatric disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent and display considerable clinical and genetic overlap. Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission have been shown to play an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Here we aim to assess the genetic contribution of these systems to eight psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (ANO), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and Tourette's syndrome (TS)) using publicly available GWAS analyses performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium that include more than 160,000 cases and 275,000 controls. To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic examination of genes encoding proteins essential to the function of these two neurotransmitter systems in these disorders. Our results support a pleiotropic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in several psychiatric conditions.",2022
Dopamine release during psychological stress in euthymic bipolar I disorder: a Positron Emission Tomography study with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride.,"Neurochemical mechanisms underlying stress induced relapse of mood episodes in Bipolar I Disorder (BD) remain unknown. This study investigated whether euthymic BD patients have a greater dopamine release in ventral striatum, caudate and putamen in response to psychological stress using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning with the radiotracer [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride. Euthymic patients with BD (n = 10) and 10 matched healthy controls underwent two [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET scans, one during a ""stress"" and the other in a ""no stress"" condition separated by at least 24 h. Montreal Imaging Stress Test (MIST) was used to induce stress during stress condition. Participants received an injection of [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride over one minute followed by PET scan for 60 min. Participants were assessed for mood symptom severity at baseline, and before and after each scan. The reduction in [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride binding in stress condition compared with non-stress rest condition for each subject provided an estimate of dopamine release due to stress. There was a significant effect of stress in reducing the [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride binding in the ventral striatum, caudate and putamen; however, no significant effects of group or condition x group interaction were found. Small sample size and recruitment of euthymic patients who may be less vulnerable to stress may limit the generalizability of findings. Our findings showed that psychological stress led to dopamine release in the basal ganglia for all participants but the magnitude of dopamine release during a stress task was not different between euthymic BD patients and healthy controls.",2021
Changes in striatal dopamine transporters in bipolar disorder and valproate treatment.,"Previous studies suggested that a disturbance of the dopamine system underlies the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, the therapeutic action of medications for treating BD, such as valproate (VPA), might modulate dopamine system activity, but it remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) in BD patients and in social defeat (SD) mice treated with VPA. We enrolled community-dwelling controls (N = 18) and BD patients (N = 23) who were treated with VPA in a euthymic stage. The striatal DAT availabilities were approached by TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography. We also established a chronic SD mouse model and treated mice with 350 mg/kg VPA for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests were administered, and striatal DAT expression levels were determined. In humans, the level of striatal DAT availability was significantly higher in euthymic BD patients (1.52 ± 0.17 and 1.37 ± 0.23, p = 0.015). Moreover, the level of striatal DAT availability was also negatively correlated with the VPA concentration in BD patients (r = -0.653, p = 0.003). In SD mice, the expression of striatal DAT significantly increased (p < 0.001), and the SD effect on DAT expression was rescued by VPA treatment. The striatal DAT might play a role in the pathophysiology of BD and in the therapeutic mechanism of VPA. The homeostasis of DAT might represent a new therapeutic strategy for BD patients.",2021
Critical Impact of Different Conserved Endoplasmic Retention Motifs and Dopamine Receptor Interacting Proteins (DRIPs) on Intracellular Localization and Trafficking of the D<sub>2</sub> Dopamine Receptor (D<sub>2</sub>-R) Isoforms.,"The type 2 dopamine receptor D<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>2</sub>-R), member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, exists in two isoforms, short (D<sub>2S</sub>-R) and long (D<sub>2L</sub>-R). They differ by an additional 29 amino acids (AA) in the third cytoplasmic loop (ICL3) of the D<sub>2L</sub>-R. These isoforms differ in their intracellular localization and trafficking functionality, as D<sub>2L</sub>-R possesses a larger intracellular pool, mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This review focuses on the evolutionarily conserved motifs in the ICL3 of the D<sub>2</sub>-R and proteins interacting with the ICL3 of both isoforms, specifically with the 29 AA insert. These motifs might be involved in D<sub>2</sub>-R exit from the ER and have an impact on cell-surface and intracellular localization and, therefore, also play a role in the function of dopamine receptor signaling, ligand binding and possible homo/heterodimerization. Our recent bioinformatic data on potential new interaction partners for the ICL3 of D<sub>2</sub>-Rs are also presented. Both are highly relevant, and have clinical impacts on the pathophysiology of several diseases such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, manic depression, and others, as they are connected to a variety of essential motifs and differences in communication with interaction partners.",2020
Dysregulation of oxytocin and dopamine in the corticostriatal circuitry in bipolar II disorder.,"The oxytocin (OXT) and dopamine systems synergistically facilitate striatal reactivity. Abnormal striatal activation has repeatedly been observed in patients with bipolar disorder (BD); however, such abnormality remains unclear in BD II. Here we aimed to investigate whether the corticostriatal connectivity was altered and the possible relationships among corticostriatal connectivity, OXT, and dopamine systems in BD II. Twenty-five BD II patients, as defined by the DSM-V, and 29 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in this study. Plasma OXT was measured and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was assessed using [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]TRODAT-1 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Brain network functional connectivity (FC) was measured during the resting-state using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the dorsal caudate (DC) was selected as the seed region. The results showed that the OXT level was significantly lower in the BD II patients, while the striatal DAT availability was not significantly different between the BD II and HC groups. The BD II patients exhibited significantly lower FC between the DC and the executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior parietal cortex) as compared with the HC. Only observed in HC, the DC-posterior parietal cortex FC was negatively correlated with the OXT level and striatal DAT availability. Our findings in the HC support a model in which the OXT and dopamine systems act in tandem to regulate corticostriatal circuitry, while the synergistic interaction was perturbed in BD II. Taken together, these results implied a maladaptive neuroplasticity in BD II.",2020
Heightened reward response is associated with HCN2 overexpression in the ventral tegmental area in morphine-sensitized rats.,"Morphine sensitization is associated with increased locomotion and stereotypies in rats. This persistent condition has been proposed as a model of manic-like symptoms. Modifications in reward threshold are considered a central feature of mania and have been related to changes in mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic transmission. Thus, to further characterize this model, we investigated reward responses in morphine-sensitized male rats and the mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenotype. In particular, we examined the possible involvement of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels as they play a critical role in regulating the excitability of dopaminergic neurons. Rats were trained to self-administer sucrose to study whether morphine sensitization affected motivated behavior. Next, the dopaminergic response to sucrose was examined in the nucleus accumbens shell by in vivo microdialysis. To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the increased dopaminergic transmission in morphine-sensitized rats, HCN2 channel expression levels in mesocorticolimbic regions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Sensitized rats showed an enhanced motivation to work for sucrose that was accompanied by an increased dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption in the nucleus accumbens shell. Moreover, HCN2 expression levels were increased in the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that their increased expression may underpin the enhanced motivation for sucrose reward and nucleus accumbens shell dopaminergic response in sensitized rats. The modified behavioral and dopaminergic reward response observed in sensitized rats supports the suggestion that the condition of morphine sensitization can be regarded as a model of manic symptoms.",2020
Genetics of schizophrenia in the South African Xhosa.,"Africa, the ancestral home of all modern humans, is the most informative continent for understanding the human genome and its contribution to complex disease. To better understand the genetics of schizophrenia, we studied the illness in the Xhosa population of South Africa, recruiting 909 cases and 917 age-, gender-, and residence-matched controls. Individuals with schizophrenia were significantly more likely than controls to harbor private, severely damaging mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic function, including neural circuitry mediated by the neurotransmitters glutamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and dopamine. Schizophrenia is genetically highly heterogeneous, involving severe ultrarare mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic plasticity. The depth of genetic variation in Africa revealed this relationship with a moderate sample size and informed our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia worldwide.",2020
Dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor and GSK3β signaling mediate deficits in novel object recognition memory within dopamine transporter knockdown mice.,"Over-stimulation of dopamine signaling is thought to underlie the pathophysiology of a list of mental disorders, such as psychosis, mania and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These disorders are frequently associated with cognitive deficits in attention or learning and memory, suggesting that persistent activation of dopamine signaling may change neural plasticity to induce cognitive or emotional malfunction. Dopamine transporter knockdown (DAT-KD) mice were used to mimic a hyper-dopamine state. Novel object recognition (NOR) task was performed to assess the recognition memory. To test the role of dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor (D<sub>3</sub>R) on NOR, DAT-KD mice were treated with either a D<sub>3</sub>R antagonist, FAUC365 or by deletion of D<sub>3</sub>R. Total or phospho-GSK3 and -ERK1/2 signals in various brain regions were measured by Western blot analyses. To examine the impact of GSK3 signal on NOR, wild-type mice were systemically treated with GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 or, micro-injected with lentiviral shRNA of GSK3β or GSK3α in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We confirmed our previous findings that DAT-KD mice displayed a deficit in NOR memory, which could be prevented by deletion of D<sub>3</sub>R or exposure to FAUC365. In WT mice, p-GSK3α and p-GSK3β were significantly decreased in the mPFC after exposure to novel objects; however, the DAT-KD mice exhibited no such change in mPFC p-GSK3α/β levels. DAT-KD mice treated with FAUC365 or with D<sub>3</sub>R deletion exhibited restored novelty-induced GSK3 dephosphorylation in the mPFC. Moreover, inhibition of GSK3 in WT mice diminished NOR performance and impaired recognition memory. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of GSK3β, but not GSK3α, in the mPFC of WT mice also impaired NOR. These findings suggest that D<sub>3</sub>R acts via GSK3β signaling in the mPFC to play a functional role in NOR memory. In addition, treatment with D<sub>3</sub>R antagonists may be a reasonable approach for ameliorating cognitive impairments or episodic memory deficits in bipolar disorder patients.",2020
"Plasma neuropeptide levels in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder and healthy controls: A multiplex immunoassay study.","We aimed to compare neuropeptide levels between patients with major psychiatric disorders and healthy controls and examine their association with symptoms and cognitive function. The participants were 149 patients with schizophrenia, 115 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 186 unremitted patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 350 healthy controls. Psychiatric (schizophrenic, manic, and depressive) symptoms, sleep state, and cognitive (premorbid intelligence quotient, general cognitive, and memory) functions were evaluated. A multiplex immunoassay kit was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels. The verification assay revealed that CSF α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were too low to be reliably measured, while plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels could be successfully measured. Plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and healthy controls. Plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and cognitive function scores in patients or healthy controls. Our data suggest that plasma neuropeptide levels do not elucidate the involvement of neuropeptides in the pathology of schizophrenia, BD, or MDD.",2023
Evidence of alterations of Beta-endorphin levels and Mu-opioid receptor gene expression in bipolar disorder.,"Despite the well-recognized effects of endogenous opioids on mood and behavior, research on its role in bipolar disorder (BD) is still limited to small or anecdotal reports. Considering that Beta-endorphins (β-END) and Mu-opioid receptors (MOR), in particular, have a crucial activity in affective modulation, we hypothesized their alteration in BD. A cross-sectional study was conducted. We compared: (1) BD type I (BD-I) patients (n = 50) vs healthy controls (n = 27), (2) two BD-I subject subgroups: manic (MAN; n = 25) vs depressed (DEP; n = 25) subjects. Plasma levels of β-END and MOR gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed using ELISA Immunoassay qRT-PCR. We found that subjects with BD exhibited a significant upregulation of MOR gene expression and a decrease of β-END (p<0.0001 for both). MAN display higher MOR levels than DEP (p<0.001) and HC (p<0.0001). Plasma levels of β-END were lower in DEP compared to MAN (p<0.05) and HC (p<0.0001). The main limitations are the cross-sectional design and the lack of a group of euthymic subjects. Although preliminary, our results suggest a dysregulation of the endogenous opioid systems in BD. In particular, both MAN and DEP showed a reduction of β-END levels, whereas MAN was associated with MOR gene overexpression.",2022

Prolactin and beta-endorphin serum elevations after ECT in manic patients.,"Alterations in prolactin and beta-endorphin serum levels after ECT are well-established findings in depression. The present study focuses on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) response patterns of the mentioned parameters in patients suffering from acute mania. Following the first three ECTs of a treatment series in 19 patients diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria as suffering from mania, blood samples were drawn before, and 20, 30 and 40 minutes after ECT. Serum prolactin and beta-endorphin levels were established in order to gain information about the effects of ECT on different neurotransmitter systems. A significant transient increase in serum prolactin after ECT was found. Furthermore, in females but not males, delta(max)prolactin diminished over the course of treatment as prolactin baseline levels increased. beta-endorphin levels showed a stable transient increase after ECT stimulus regardless from sex or treatment. The reported findings reflect those established in depression. This suggests that they are epiphenomenal to ECT.",2000
Evidence against changes in corticotroph CRF receptors in depressed patients.,"Previous studies by a number have investigators have documented a decreased adrenocortotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin/beta-endorphin (beta-End) response to ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (oCRF) in depressed patients. Since depressed patients demonstrate higher plasma cortisol concentrations at the time of oCRF challenge, it is difficult to determine if the decreased ACTH response is due to enhanced negative feedback of cortisol on ACTH release or an alteration in CRF receptors in depressed patients. To evaluate the response to oCRF in an ""open feedback loop"" system, we administered metyrapone 750 mg at 4 PM and 7:30 PM, followed by administration of oCRF 0.3 microgram/kg at 8 PM in 10 normal controls and 10 depressed patients. Administration of metyrapone at this time in the circadian rhythm clamped plasma cortisol concentrations to less than 2 micrograms/dl but did not result in rebound ACTH or beta-End secretion in control subjects. In control subjects, metyrapone administration produced a 85% blockade of the cortisol response as well as a 3-fold greater beta-End response compared to administration of the same dose of oCRF without metyrapone. The 10 depressed patients and their matched controls demonstrated identical beta-End responses (integrated response for controls = 291 +/- 61, for patients = 352 +/- 86) and cortisol responses (integrated response for controls = 187 +/- 38, for patients = 206 +/- 52) to oCRF following metyrapone pretreatment. These data confirm that corticotroph CRF receptors are normal in depressed patients, and that cortisol feedback plays an essential role in the abnormal ACTH and beta-End response to oCRF in depressed patients.",1995
Disturbed glucocorticoid receptor autoregulation and corticotropin response to dexamethasone in depressives pretreated with metyrapone.,"We studied glucocorticoid receptor autoregulation and corticotropin response to dexamethasone in depressed patients and controls, attempting to control for the confounding effect of endogenous glucocorticoids. After depletion of endogenous cortisol, depressed patients showed an attenuated suppressibility of corticotropin by dexamethasone in the face of unchanged dexamethasone plasma levels. Beta-endorphin levels were strongly correlated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations. Although metyrapone administration resulted in a marked rise of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell in controls, this effect was not present in depressives. These data support the hypothesis of a decreased glucocorticoid receptor plasticity and a partial steroid resistance in depression.",1991

Abnormal beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin responses to TRH and LRH administration in primary and secondary affective disorders.,"Anomalous anterior pituitary hormone responses to acute administration of TRH and LRH have previously been observed in patients with primary affective disorders (PAD), with TRH eliciting GH, FSH and LH rises, and LRH eliciting GH and Prl rises. We examined whether the same unusual responses were present also for beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) in 15 PAD patients, in 9 patients with secondary affective disorders (SAD), and in 7 controls. TRH (500 micrograms iv) elicited rises of beta-EP plasma levels in 5 PAD and 2 SAD patients, and of beta-LPH in 4 PAD and 3 SAD patients. LRH (150 micrograms iv) elicited rises of plasma beta-EP levels in 2 PAD and 2 SAD patients, and of beta-LPH in 5 PAD and 2 SAD patients. No rises of beta-EP and beta-LPH plasma levels were observed in PAD patients after saline administration, nor in the controls after TRH, LRH or saline administration.",1986

Pro-opiomelanocortin-related peptides in cerebrospinal fluid: a study of manic-depressive disorder.,"Five peptide fragments of pro-opiomelanocortin (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, beta-lipoprotin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, and the N-terminal fragment of pro-opiomelanocortin) were measured by radioimmunoassay in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 31 normal volunteers and 26 euthymic lithium-treated bipolar patients (14 of whom provided a second CSF sample in the unmedicated state). With the exception of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, in the normal volunteers' CSF, levels of these peptides were highly correlated with one another, suggesting that: (1) some common regulatory factor may control the levels of these four peptides in CSF; and (2) CSF alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is independently regulated from the other pro-opiomelanocortin products. Some of these correlations were absent in the patient groups, suggesting subtle alterations in pro-opiomelanocortin processing in manic-depressive illness. No effect of lithium on the CSF levels of these peptides was observed. No group differences were found.",1985

Hallucinations in patients with major depression. Interactions between CSF monoaminergic and endorphinergic indices.,"CSF levels of radioreceptorassayed endorphins Fraction I (EndFI, n = 92) and homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (n = 118) were measured in patients with major depressive disorders according to Research Diagnostic Criteria (18% were psychotic; 11% hallucinated during the peak of the depressive episode). CSF measures (both ""raw"" variables and ranks) were uni- and multivariately correlated with both dichotomized and scored measures of hallucinations of any type. Hallucinations were statistically strongly associated with higher HVA levels, irrespective of prior medication with neuroleptics, and with the interactive product HVA X EndFI and the interactive ratio HVA/5-HIAA. Results suggest interactions between dopaminergic, serotonergic and endorphinergic neurotransmission being involved in the biochemical substrate of depressive hallucinatory episodes.",1985

Opioid plasma levels in primary affective disorders. Effect of desimipramine therapy.,"Mean plasma levels of beta-endorphin (beta EP), beta-lipotropin (beta LPH) and ACTH were significantly higher in 22 patients with primary affective disorders (PAD) and in 2 schizoaffective subjects off therapy since 10 days than in 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Desimipramine therapy (50-100 mg/day per os for 3-5 weeks) induced in parallel psychological improvement and fall in beta LPH-beta EP in 6 of 8 PAD patients treated, and a normalization of beta EP-beta LPH levels with minimal mood improvement in the 2 schizoaffective subjects. These results indicate that the opioid levels are increased in PAD and schizoaffective patients and normalized by the desimipramine therapy in those patients in whom the affective disorders improved.",1984
Depression and CSF endorphin fraction I: seasonal variation and higher levels in unipolar than bipolar patients.,"Radioreceptor assay of endorphin Fraction I in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 92 inpatients suffering from major depression revealed the following: (1) clearly elevated levels as compared to normal control subjects, (2) higher level in unipolar than in bipolar patients, and (3) seasonal rhythms showing peaks in early fall for unipolar patients and late fall for bipolar patients. The annual pattern observed bears some resemblance to the known seasonal variations in the incidence of affective disorders and suicide.",1983
The measurement of endorphins in body fluids.,"The measurement of endorphins in body fluids has been an important advance in clinical research attempting to link the endogenous opioid system to psychiatric illness and symptomatology. The consideration of methodologic differences in assay technique and in clinical methods is important in evaluating results of studies. Whereas findings in early clinical studies supported the notion of increased endorphin system function in patients with schizophrenia, cumulative data from the considerable number of studies carried out throughout world centers have been unable to demonstrate a consistent abnormality in levels of endorphins in CSF or plasma of patients with schizophrenia. Among the affective disorders, data suggest the possibility of relative changes in levels of opioids within individual manic-depressive patients when studied across state change from depression to mania. In studies of depressive illness there is accumulating evidence that the endogenous opioid system may relate or contribute to abnormality of the HPA axis. In our work measuring opioids in CSF we have observed relationships between anxiety and CSF opioids in normals and psychiatric patients and changes in CSF opioid activity in patients with anorexia nervosa accompanying weight change. These data are consistent with other evidence linking endorphins to CNS noradrenergic systems and to biologic response to stress.",1983
Alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate neurotransmission linked to intermittent theta-burst stimulation in depression: a sham-controlled study.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13) = 0.54, p = 0.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11) = 0.66, p = 0.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",2025
[Emerging suicidal ideation in a bipolar patient after taking pregabalin: a case report].,"Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness and often occurs with comorbidities like anxiety or alcohol abuse. Thus pregabalin could be a promising drug. We present a case report of a 37-year-old woman with bipolar II disorder suffering from a depressive episode with features of anxiety and increased alcohol consumption. The patient was started on quetiapine as monotherapy. After a few days of add-on pregabalin, we observed suicidal ideations and self-harming behaviour, although expression of anxiety as well as alcohol consumption showed a decrease. When we stopped pregabalin and increased the dosage of quetiapine, suicidal behaviour almost disappeared. In the relevant literature, there is disagreement on the use of pregabalin. On the one hand, pregabalin is described as a safe and well-tolerated drug, and on the other hand, there are also concerns about the suicidal effect of anticonvulsants. In conclusion, we recommend the cautious use of pregabalin and other anticonvulsant drugs in patients with affective disorder. There could be a promising effect on the comorbidities but the effect on mood remains still unclear.",2025
Posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal excitation-inhibition balance in euthymic bipolar disorder.,"Persistent cognitive deficits and functional impairments are associated with bipolar disorder (BD), even during the euthymic phase. The dysfunction of default mode network (DMN) is critical for self-referential and emotional mental processes and is implicated in BD. The current study aims to explore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate and <i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in hubs of the DMN during the euthymic patients with BD (euBD). Thirty-four euBD and 55 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to the study. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), glutamate (with PRESS sequence) and GABA levels (with MEGAPRESS sequence) were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Measured concentrations of excitatory glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and inhibitory GABA were used to calculate the excitatory/inhibitory (<i>E</i>/<i>I</i>) ratio. Executive and attentional functions were respectively assessed using the Wisconsin card-sorting test and continuous performance test. euBD performed worse on attentional function than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Compared to controls, euBD had higher <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratios in the PCC (<i>p</i> = 0.023), mainly driven by a higher Glx level in the PCC of euBD (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Only in the BD group, a marginally significant negative association between the mPFC <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratio (Glx/GABA) and executive function was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.068). Disturbed E/I balance, particularly elevated Glx/GABA ratio in PCC is observed in euBD. The <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> balance in hubs of DMN may serve as potential biomarkers for euBD, which may also contribute to their poorer executive function.",2024

Association between abnormal brain oscillations and cognitive performance in patients with bipolar disorder: Molecular mechanisms and clinical evidence.,"Brain oscillations have gained great attention in neuroscience during recent decades as functional building blocks of cognitive-sensory processes. Research has shown that oscillations in ""alpha,"" ""beta,"" ""gamma,"" ""delta,"" and ""theta"" frequency windows are highly modified in brain pathology, including in patients with cognitive impairment like bipolar disorder (BD). The study of changes in brain oscillations can provide fundamental knowledge for exploring neurophysiological biomarkers in cognitive impairment. The present article reviews findings from the role and molecular basis of abnormal neural oscillation and synchronization in the symptoms of patients with BD. An overview of the results clearly demonstrates that, in cognitive-sensory processes, resting and evoked/event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands are abnormally changed in patients with BD showing psychotic features. Abnormal oscillations have been found to be associated with several neural dysfunctions and abnormalities contributing to BD, including abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission signaling, hippocampal cell discharge, abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis, impaired cadherin and synaptic contact-based cell adhesion processes, extended lateral ventricles, decreased prefrontal cortical gray matter, and decreased hippocampal volume. Mechanistically, impairment in calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 I, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase proteins, genes involved in brain neurogenesis and synaptogenesis like WNT3 and ACTG2, genes involved in the cell adhesion process like CDH12 and DISC1, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling have been reported as the main molecular contributors to the abnormalities in resting-state low-frequency oscillations in BD patients. Findings also showed the association of impaired synaptic connections and disrupted membrane potential with abnormal beta/gamma oscillatory activity in patients with BD. Of note, the synaptic GABA neurotransmitter has been found to be a fundamental requirement for the occurrence of long-distance synchronous gamma oscillations necessary for coordinating the activity of neural networks between various brain regions.",2022
"Gabapentin and pregabalin in bipolar disorder, anxiety states, and insomnia: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and rationale.","The gabapentinoids, gabapentin, and pregabalin, target the α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels. Initially licensed for pain and seizures, they have become widely prescribed drugs. Many of these uses are off-label for psychiatric indications, and there is increasing concern about their safety, so it is particularly important to have good evidence to justify this usage. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for three of their common psychiatric uses: bipolar disorder, anxiety, and insomnia. Fifty-five double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 open-label studies were identified. For bipolar disorder, four double-blind RCTs investigating gabapentin, and no double-blind RCTs investigating pregabalin, were identified. A quantitative synthesis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in the study population, design and outcome measures. Across the anxiety spectrum, a consistent but not universal effect in favour of gabapentinoids compared to placebo was seen (standardised mean difference [SMD] ranging between -2.25 and -0.25). Notably, pregabalin (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.18) and gabapentin (SMD -0.92, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.52) were more effective than placebo in reducing preoperative anxiety. In insomnia, results were inconclusive. We conclude that there is moderate evidence of the efficacy of gabapentinoids in anxiety states, but minimal evidence in bipolar disorder and insomnia and they should be used for these disorders only with strong justification. This recommendation applies despite the attractive pharmacological and genetic rationale for targeting voltage-gated calcium channels.",2022
Suicide Related Phenotypes in a Bipolar Sample: Genetic Underpinnings.,"Suicide in Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a relevant clinical concern. Genetics may shape the individual risk for suicide behavior in BD, together with known clinical factors. The lack of consistent replication in BD may be associated with its multigenetic component. In the present contribution we analyzed a sample of BD individuals (from STEP-BD database) to identify the genetic variants potentially associated with three different suicide-related phenotypes: (1) a feeling that the life was not worth living; (2) fantasies about committing a violent suicide; (3) previous attempted suicide. The sample under analysis included 1115 BD individuals. None of the SNPs reached genome-wide significance. However, a trend of association was evidenced for rs2767403, an intron variant of AOPEP gene, in association with phenotype #1 (<i>p</i> = 5.977 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). The molecular pathway analysis showed a significant enrichment in all the investigated phenotypes on pathways related to post synaptic signaling, neurotransmission and neurodevelopment. Further, NOTCH signaling or the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic signaling were found to be associated with specific suicide-related phenotypes. The present investigation contributes to the hypothesis that the genetic architecture of suicide behaviors in BD is related to alteration of entire pathways rather than single genes. In particular, our molecular pathway analysis points on some specific molecular events that could be the focus of further research in this field.",2021
"Results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multimodal-MRI pilot study of gabapentin for co-occurring bipolar and cannabis use disorders.","Disrupted brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate homeostasis is a promising target for pharmacological intervention in co-occurring bipolar disorder (BD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Gabapentin is a safe and well-tolerated medication, FDA-approved to treat other neurological diseases, that restores GABA/glutamate homeostasis, with treatment studies supporting efficacy in treating CUD, as well as anxiety and sleep disorders that are common to both BD and CUD. The present manuscript represents the primary report of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover (1-week/condition), multimodal-MRI (proton-MR spectroscopy, functional MRI) pilot study of gabapentin (1200 mg/day) in BD + CUD (n = 22). Primary analyses revealed that (1) gabapentin was well tolerated and adherence and retention were high, (2) gabapentin increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right basal ganglia (rBG) glutamate levels and (3) gabapentin increased activation to visual cannabis cues in the posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC, a region involved in response inhibition to rewarding stimuli). Exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes further found that in participants taking gabapentin versus placebo, (1) elevations of dACC GABA levels were associated with lower manic/mixed and depressive symptoms and (2) elevations of rBG glutamate levels and pMCC activation to cannabis cues were associated with lower cannabis use. Though promising, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution due to observed randomization order effects on dACC glutamate levels and identification of statistical moderators that differed by randomization order (i.e. cigarette-smoking status on rBG glutamate levels and pMCC cue activation). Nonetheless, they provide the necessary foundation for a more robustly designed (urn-randomized, parallel-group) future study of adjuvant gabapentin for BD + CUD.",2022
Pregabalin Induced Mood Elevation in Bipolar Patients: Case-Reports.,,2021
Extra-synaptic modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> and efficacy in bipolar disorder.,"Bipolar disorder type I is a severe psychiatric condition that leads to significant morbidity and mortality and whose treatment remains suboptimal. Its pathophysiology involves disturbance in the control of ionic fluxes so that when patients are either manic or depressed, the resting membrane potential of neurons is more depolarized than normal. Available mood stabilizers have a shared mechanism of normalizing ion flux by compensating for ionic abnormalities, and normalizing membrane potential. Agents that significantly potentiate extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are expected to be particularly effective in hyperpolarizing resting membrane potential in bipolar patients, thereby normalizing their membrane potential. New neuroactive steroid-like agents are being tested in humans for depression and insomnia. These agents include brexanolone, ganaxolone, and gaboxadol. Brexanolone has been approved for the treatment of postpartum depression, ganaxolone is being studied for treatment-resistant depression, and gaboxadol development for the treatment of insomnia has been abandoned due to narrow therapeutic index. In addition to the current studies, these agents are expected to have particular efficacy in acute and prophylactic management of bipolar I disorder by hyperpolarizing the resting potential of neurons and antagonizing one of the most reproducible demonstrated biologic abnormalities of this illness.",2021
[Comparative analysis of serum glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in patients with bipolar depressive disorder and major depression disorder].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the difference of serum glutamate (Glu) and gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels between depressive patients and bipolar disorder patients with depressive episodes. <b>Methods:</b> From May 2018 to March 2019, forty-seven patients with depression (depression group) and 45 patients with bipolar depressive episode (bipolar depression group) were selected from the department of psychiatry, the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, and 41 healthy controls (healthy control group) were simultaneously recruited from the community. The subjects' depression and anxiety were assessed by 17 items of Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). The serum levels of Glu, GABA and Glu decarboxylase (GAD) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . <b>Results:</b> The serum Glu level ( (36±7) mg/L, (37±7) mg/L vs (28±4) mg/L, <i>F=</i>10.97, <i>P<</i>0.01) and Glu/GABA ratio (5.77±0.35, 8.18±0.24 vs 3.35±0.33, <i>F=</i>37.68, <i>P<</i>0.01) in depression and bipolar depression groups were higher than those of healthy control group, while the GABA level ((6.1±0.7) μmol/L,(4.1±0.8) μmol/L vs (8.1±1.2) μmol/L, <i>F=</i>21.61, <i>P<</i>0.01) and GAD ((31±6) U/L, (31±6) U/L vs (35±6) U/L, <i>F=</i>5.61, <i>P<</i>0.01) were lower than those of healthy control group. The level of serum GABA in bipolar depression group was lower than that in depression group. However, Glu/GABA was higher in bipolar depression group than that in depression group (<i>P<</i>0.01). The level of serum GABA in depression group was negatively correlated with HAMD sleep disorder factor (<i>r=</i>-0.46, <i>P=</i>0.01). <b>Conclusions:</b> Both depression and bipolar depression have abnormal levels of Glu, GABA neurotransmitters and imbalance between Glu and GABA in peripheral blood circulation. Moreover, these abnormalities are more obvious in patients with bipolar depression.",2020
Genetics of schizophrenia in the South African Xhosa.,"Africa, the ancestral home of all modern humans, is the most informative continent for understanding the human genome and its contribution to complex disease. To better understand the genetics of schizophrenia, we studied the illness in the Xhosa population of South Africa, recruiting 909 cases and 917 age-, gender-, and residence-matched controls. Individuals with schizophrenia were significantly more likely than controls to harbor private, severely damaging mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic function, including neural circuitry mediated by the neurotransmitters glutamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and dopamine. Schizophrenia is genetically highly heterogeneous, involving severe ultrarare mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic plasticity. The depth of genetic variation in Africa revealed this relationship with a moderate sample size and informed our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia worldwide.",2020
ACC Glu/GABA ratio is decreased in euthymic bipolar disorder I patients: possible in vivo neurometabolite explanation for mood stabilization.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by unstable mood states ranging from mania to depression. Although there is some evidence that mood instability may result from an imbalance between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurotransmission, few proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) studies have measured these two neurometabolites simultaneously in BD. The enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD1) catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate (Glu) to GABA, and its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might influence Glu/GABA ratio. Thus, we investigated Glu/GABA ratio in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of euthymic BD type I patients and healthy controls (HC), and assessed the influence of both mood stabilizers and GAD1 SNPs on this ratio. Eighty-eight subjects (50 euthymic BD type I patients and 38 HC) underwent 3T <sup>1</sup>H-MRS in the dACC (2 × 2 × 4.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) using a two-dimensional JPRESS sequence and all subjects were genotyped for 4 SNPs in the GAD1 gene. BD patients had lower dACC Glu/GABA ratio compared to HC, where this was influenced by anticonvulsant and antipsychotic medications, but not lithium. The presence of GAD1 rs1978340 allele A was associated with higher Glu/GABA ratio in BD, while patients without this allele taking mood stabilizers had a lower Glu/GABA ratio. The lowering of dACC Glu/GABA could be one explanation for the mood stabilizing action of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics in BD type I euthymia. Therefore, this putative role of Glu/GABA ratio and the influence of GAD1 genotype interacting with mood stabilization medication should be confirmed by further studies involving larger samples and other mood states.ClincalTrials.gov registration: NCT01237158.",2021
Opportunities for selective reporting of harms in randomized clinical trials: Selection criteria for non-systematic adverse events.,"Adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials may be reported in multiple sources. Different methods for reporting adverse events across trials or across sources for a single trial may produce inconsistent information about the adverse events associated with interventions. We compared the methods authors use to decide which AEs to include in a particular source (i.e., ""selection criteria""), including the number of different types of AEs reported (i.e., rather than the number of events). We compared sources (e.g., journal articles, clinical study reports (CSRs)) of trials for two drug-indications-gabapentin for neuropathic pain and quetiapine for bipolar depression. Electronic searches were completed in 2015. We identified selection criteria and assessed how criteria affected AE reporting. We identified 21 gabapentin and 7 quetiapine trials. We found 6 gabapentin CSRs and 2 quetiapine CSRs, all written by drug manufacturers. All CSRs reported all AEs without applying selection criteria; by comparison, no other source reported all AEs, and 15/68 (22%) gabapentin sources and 19/48 (40%) quetiapine sources reported using selection criteria. Selection criteria greatly affected the number of AEs reported. For example, 67/316 (21%) AEs in one quetiapine trial met the criterion ""occurring in ≥2% of participants in any treatment group,"" while only 5/316 (2%) AEs met the criterion ""occurring in ≥10% of quetiapine-treated patients and twice as frequent in the quetiapine group as the placebo group."" Selection criteria for reporting AEs vary across trials and across sources for individual trials. If investigators do not pre-specify selection criteria, they might ""cherry-pick"" AEs based on results. Even if investigators pre-specify selection criteria, selective reporting will produce biased meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines. Data about all AEs identified in clinical trials should be publicly available; however, sharing data will not solve all the problems identified in this study.",2019
Lithium and GADL1 regulate glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity to modulate KCTD12 expression.,"Potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 12 (KCTD12), the auxiliary GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunit, is identified as a susceptibility gene for bipolar I (BPI) disorder in the Han Chinese population. Moreover, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17026688 in glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1) is shown to be associated with lithium response in Han Chinese BPI patients. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the relationship among lithium, GADL1, and KCTD12. In circulating CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophage cells, BPI patients showed a significantly higher percentage of KCTD12 expression than healthy controls. Among BPI patients, carriers of the 'T' allele (i.e., CT or TT) at site rs17026688 were found to secrete lower amounts of GADL1 but higher amounts of GABA b receptor 2 (GABBR2) in the plasma. In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, lithium treatment increased the percentage of KCTD12 expression. Through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), lithium induced cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated KCTD12 promoter activation. On the other hand, GADL1 overexpression enhanced GSK-3 activation and inhibited KCTD12 expression. We found that lithium induced, whereas GADL1 inhibited, KCTD12 expression. These findings suggested that KCTD12 may be an important gene with respect to neuron excitability and lithium response in BPI patients. Therefore, targeting GSK-3 activity and/or KCTD12 expression may constitute a possible therapeutic strategy for treating patients with BPI disorder.",2019
The Current and Future Potential of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation With Electroencephalography in Psychiatry.,"The search for biological targets in psychiatric disorders is essential to better understand illness mechanisms and also to monitor and predict response to currently available therapeutic interventions. To this end, the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) has emerged as a powerful clinical research tool. TMS-EEG allows cortical properties, such as excitability, inhibition, oscillatory activity, and connectivity, to be directly probed within a specific region of the cortex. This review will summarize the state of the current literature on TMS-EEG and its potential to uncover biological targets in psychiatric illnesses, with a focus on major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Collectively, the reviewed studies suggest that alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition and gamma oscillations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and neighboring frontal regions are potential shared biomarkers in psychiatry, highlighting the potential of TMS-EEG to help identify translational biomarkers.",2019
Harms are assessed inconsistently and reported inadequately Part 2: nonsystematic adverse events.,"We examined nonsystematic adverse events (AEs) in Part 2 (of 2) of a study describing the assessment and reporting AEs in clinical trials. We examined 21 trials of gabapentin for neuropathic pain (52 sources) and seven trials of quetiapine for bipolar depression (80 sources) using data from the Multiple Data Sources study. We extracted and compared information about nonsystematic AEs (i.e., AEs that were not assessed for every participant), including AEs categorized as ""serious."" We recorded whether AEs were grouped by anatomic or physiological system. Trials of the same drug reported information about different AEs. Information in public sources was inadequate for decision-making. No public source reported all AEs, or all serious AEs, identified in nonpublic sources about the same trial. Of trials with only public sources, 2/15 (13%) gabapentin and 0/3 (0%) quetiapine trials grouped AEs by anatomic or physiological system. Public sources contained little information about nonsystematic AEs, including serious AEs. Grouping might make nonsystematic AEs easier to detect; however, most public sources did not report grouped AEs. Standards are needed to improve the collection and reporting of nonsystematic AEs so that stakeholders can use trials to assess the balance of potential benefits and harms.",2019
Harms are assessed inconsistently and reported inadequately part 1: systematic adverse events.,"We examined systematic adverse events (AEs) in Part 1 (of 2) of a study describing the assessment and reporting of AEs in clinical trials. We examined 52 public and nonpublic data sources about trials of quetiapine for bipolar depression using data from the Multiple Data Sources study. We extracted and compared information about systematic AEs (i.e., AEs assessed for all participants) in six prespecified domains: cardiovascular, cholesterol, endocrine, extrapyramidal symptoms, mania, and weight. Eligible trials did not assess and report the same systematic AEs, and most results were not available in public sources. Overall, public sources reported 159 results, of which 92 of 159 (58%) included sufficient statistical information to calculate the treatment effect and its precision. Nonpublic sources reported 636 results; 630 of 636 (99%) reported sufficient statistical information. Systematic AEs were defined and analyzed in many ways, which led to many numerical results. Most systematic AEs were not mentioned in public sources. To minimize bias, methods for defining and analyzing potential AEs should be prespecified in trial registers and protocols. All trial results should be publicly available so that stakeholders can compare benefits and AEs. Trials could report core sets of AEs to facilitate decision-making.",2019

Choline Compounds of the Frontal Lobe and Temporal Glutamatergic System in Bipolar and Schizophrenia Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study.,"Modern neuroimaging techniques allow investigating brain structures and substances involved in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, trying to find new markers of these disorders. To better understanding of the pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, this study was conducted to assess the neurochemical alterations in the frontal and temporal lobes in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Twenty-one subjects with schizophrenia (paranoid and differentiated types), 16 subjects with bipolar I disorder (manic, depressive, and mixed episode), and 20 healthy subjects were studied. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and proton resonance magnetic spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS) were performed on a 1.5 T scanner. Voxels of 8 cm<sup>3</sup> were positioned in the left frontal and left temporal lobes. Glx/H<sub>2</sub>O (GABA, glutamine, and glutamate/nonsuppressed water signal) ratios were significantly increased in the left temporal lobe in schizophrenia, but not in bipolar disorder, compared with controls. Cho/H<sub>2</sub>O (choline/nonsuppressed water signal) ratios in the left frontal lobe had a tendency to increase in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, relative to controls. A lower temporal lobe NAA/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio in mixed than in manic and depressive episode of bipolar patients was also found. No other significant differences were found among three studied groups as regards NAA, Cr, and mI ratios. Our results partially confirm the role of a glutamatergic system in schizophrenia, however, only in a temporal lobe. We also point to the importance of the choline-containing compounds (marker of cellular density) in the frontal lobe of patients suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We also found the deleterious effect of mixed bipolar episode on the integrity and functioning of the temporal lobe. Glutamatergic left temporal spectroscopic changes may potentially help in differential diagnosis of schizophrenia from bipolar disorder.",2018
Morphological changes of the brain in mood disorders.,"Brain morphological changes in affective disorders occur mainly in the fronto-limbic cortex, hippocampus and amygdala - the structures regulating emotional and cognitive functioning, as well as development of somatic symptoms in the course of disorders. The largest number of reports of structural changes in the cerebral cortex include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The results of neuroimaging and sectional studies reveal changes in the volume of structures involved in the creation of neuronal circuits that affect development of mood disorders. Microscopic studies show changes in cell count, density, and morphology in these areas. Some of those changes are observed only in certain layers of the cerebral cortex. A valuable addition to this data are histochemical studies of neuronal survival markers, proinflammatory cytokines, trophic factors, and markers specific for particular cellular structures. The role of monoaminergic, GABA-ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission is confirmed by the studies on concentration of neurotransmitters, their receptors and transporters. Some of the results correlate quantitatively with the type and severity of symptoms, duration of the disorder, as well as pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacological treatment.",2018
The association between gabapentin and suicidality in bipolar patients.,"The aims of this study were to assess the association between gabapentin and suicidality in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and to determine whether the risk is greater relative to patients prescribed lithium. This retrospective observational study utilizes US population-based claims data assembled by PharMetrics Inc., comprising 47 918 patients diagnosed with BD. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years old and initiated a new monotherapy prescription of either gabapentin (n=2421) or lithium (n=3101). Patients were followed for up to 1 year. Gabapentin patients contributed 915.8 person-years (PY) of follow-up time; lithium patients contributed 1421.3 PY. There were 21 suicide/self-harm events in the gabapentin group and 16 in the lithium group. Unadjusted incidence rates were 22.9 and 11.3/1000 PY in the gabapentin and lithium groups, respectively (P=0.03). After adjusting for concomitant medications, comorbid diagnoses, age, sex, and history of suicide/self-harm, the hazard ratio was 2.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-4.5). A propensity score-matched analysis accounting for pre-existing illnesses and medications supports this finding, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.5). Relative to lithium, the use of gabapentin is significantly associated with a doubling of the risk of suicidality in patients diagnosed with BD.",2019
Real-world Effectiveness of Pharmacologic Treatments for the Prevention of Rehospitalization in a Finnish Nationwide Cohort of Patients With Bipolar Disorder.,"Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are the main maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder. Lithium is considered to be the most effective mood stabilizer, but very little is known about overall health outcomes associated with specific treatments and the comparative long-term effectiveness of specific psychotropics or routes of administration in the prevention of rehospitalizations. To study the comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments in the prevention of rehospitalization in a nationwide cohort of patients with bipolar disorder. This cohort study examined the risk of psychiatric, cardiovascular, and all-cause hospitalization from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2012, among all patients in Finland who had been hospitalized for bipolar disorder (N = 18 018; mean follow-up time, 7.2 years) using prospectively gathered nationwide databases for hospitalization and dispensed medications. The primary analysis was within-individual analysis, in which each individual was used as his or her own control to eliminate selection bias. The study adjusted for the effect of concomitant psychotropic medications, duration of illness, and the temporal orders of exposure and nonexposure periods. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2012. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for rehospitalization were calculated. Among the cohort (9558 women and 8460 men; mean [SD] age, 46.6 [17.0] years), 9721 patients (54.0%) had at least 1 psychiatric rehospitalization. In comparison between use and no use among specific agents reaching nominal statistical significance, risperidone long-acting injection (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34-1.00]), gabapentin (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44-0.77]), perphenazine long-acting injection (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41-0.88]), and lithium carbonate (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60-0.73]) were associated with the lowest risk of psychiatric rehospitalization. Concerning all-cause hospitalization, lithium (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.66-0.76]) was associated with the lowest risk. The most frequently used antipsychotic treatment, quetiapine fumarate, showed only modest effectiveness (risk of psychiatric rehospitalization: HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.98]; risk of all-cause hospitalization: HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.98]). Long-acting injections were associated with substantially better outcomes compared with identical oral antipsychotics (risk of psychiatric rehospitalization: HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55-0.90]; risk of all-cause hospitalization: HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.86]). Results from sensitivity analyses showed consistent beneficial effects only for lithium and for long-acting injections compared with their oral counterparts. Lithium was the most effective mood stabilizer, and long-acting injections the most effective antipsychotics, in preventing hospitalization due to mental or physical illness.",2018
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy changes after lithium treatment. Systematic review.,"1H MRS is widely used in the research of mental disorders. It enables evaluation of concentration or ratios of several metabolites, which play important roles in brain metabolism: N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline containing compounds, myo-inositol and glutamate, glutamine and GABA (together as Glx complex or separately). Specifically in bipolar disorder brain metabolite abnormalities include mostly NAA reduces and Glx increases in different brain regions. Bipolar disorder is associated with impairment in neurotrophic and cellular plasticity, resilience pathways and in neuroprotective processes. Lithium, which is commonly used in BD treatment, modulates neurotransmitter release, reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis, induces angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neurotrophic response. Thus brain metabolite abnormalities may elucidate the mechanisms of this processes. In the present article we systematically reviewed 26 studies - the majority of them investigated bipolar disorder ( 7 follow-up and all 11 cross-sectional studies). Moreover we dispute whether the influence of lithium on brain metabolites in bipolar disorder could explain the background of its potential neuroprotective action. The results of our literature review do not equivocally confirm Lithium's influence the metabolite changes in the brain. The majority of the follow-up studies do not support the initially assumed influence of Lithium on the increase of NAA level in various brain structures. The results of studies are inconclusive with regard to levels of Glx or Glu and Lithium intake, rather point a lack of relationship. The above results were reviewed according to the most recent theories in the field accounting for the impact of lithium (1)HMRS measures.",2018
Meta-analysis of central and peripheral γ-aminobutyric acid levels in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression.,"Many studies have measured central and peripheral γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in patients with depression. We performed a meta-analysis to provide an objective overview of GABA changes in those with unipolar or bipolar depression. After a systematic database search, original data were extracted with the help of seminal authors to calculate standardized mean differences. We compared GABA levels between patients with current major depressive episodes and controls, between euthymic patients and controls, and in patients before and after treatment. We performed meta-regressions to explore the influence of demographic and clinical variables on GABA significant mean differences. For unipolar depression, central and peripheral GABA levels were diminished in currently depressed patients, but normal in euthymic patients, compared with the healthy controls. For bipolar disorder, GABA levels were diminished in medication-free patients, but seemed to be normalized in medicated patients, compared with the healthy controls. We found no significant association with demographic or clinical variables. There was a great heterogeneity across studies, probably because of the substantial variation of clinical characteristics in the included samples. Many subanalyses were performed to assess how the diagnosis, medications, or the type of measurements of peripheral or central GABA levels may affect the main results. The GABA levels evolved differentially in patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders. Our results suggest that GABA levels could represent a biomarker of symptomatic states in patients with unipolar disorder and would be normalized by mood stabilizers in those with bipolar disorder.",2018
Alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate neurotransmission linked to intermittent theta-burst stimulation in depression: a sham-controlled study.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13) = 0.54, p = 0.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11) = 0.66, p = 0.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",2025
Changes in the medial prefrontal cortex metabolites after 6 months of medication therapy for patients with bipolar disorder: A <sup>1</sup>H-MRS study.,"The study aimed to assess brain metabolite differences in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) between acute and euthymic episodes of bipolar disorder (BD) with both mania and depression over a 6-month medication treatment period. We utilized <sup>1</sup>H-MRS technology to assess the metabolite levels in 53 individuals with BD (32 in depressive phase, 21 in manic phase) and 34 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline. After 6 months of medication treatment, 40 subjects underwent a follow-up scan in euthymic state. Metabolite levels, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), and Glutamine (Gln), were measured in the mPFC. Patients experiencing depressive and manic episodes exhibited a notable reduction in NAA/Cr + PCr ratios at baseline compared to healthy controls (p = 0.004; p = 0.006) in baseline, compared with HCs. Over the 6-month follow-up period, the manic group displayed a significant decrease in Gln/Cr + PCr compared to the initial acute phase (p = 0.03). No significant alterations were found in depressed group between baseline and follow-up. This study suggests that NAA/Cr + PCr ratios and Gln/Cr + PCr ratios in the mPFC may be associated with manic and depressive episodes, implicating that Gln and NAA might be useful biomarkers for distinguishing mood phases in BD and elucidating its mechanisms.",2024
Posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal excitation-inhibition balance in euthymic bipolar disorder.,"Persistent cognitive deficits and functional impairments are associated with bipolar disorder (BD), even during the euthymic phase. The dysfunction of default mode network (DMN) is critical for self-referential and emotional mental processes and is implicated in BD. The current study aims to explore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate and <i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in hubs of the DMN during the euthymic patients with BD (euBD). Thirty-four euBD and 55 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to the study. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), glutamate (with PRESS sequence) and GABA levels (with MEGAPRESS sequence) were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Measured concentrations of excitatory glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and inhibitory GABA were used to calculate the excitatory/inhibitory (<i>E</i>/<i>I</i>) ratio. Executive and attentional functions were respectively assessed using the Wisconsin card-sorting test and continuous performance test. euBD performed worse on attentional function than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Compared to controls, euBD had higher <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratios in the PCC (<i>p</i> = 0.023), mainly driven by a higher Glx level in the PCC of euBD (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Only in the BD group, a marginally significant negative association between the mPFC <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratio (Glx/GABA) and executive function was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.068). Disturbed E/I balance, particularly elevated Glx/GABA ratio in PCC is observed in euBD. The <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> balance in hubs of DMN may serve as potential biomarkers for euBD, which may also contribute to their poorer executive function.",2024
Association of neurotransmitter pathway polygenic risk with specific symptom profiles in psychosis.,"A primary goal of psychiatry is to better understand the pathways that link genetic risk to psychiatric symptoms. Here, we tested association of diagnosis and endophenotypes with overall and neurotransmitter pathway-specific polygenic risk in patients with early-stage psychosis. Subjects included 205 demographically diverse cases with a psychotic disorder who underwent comprehensive psychiatric and neurological phenotyping and 115 matched controls. Following genotyping, we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS summary statistics. To test if overall genetic risk can be partitioned into affected neurotransmitter pathways, we calculated pathway PGSs (pPGSs) for SZ risk affecting each of four major neurotransmitter systems: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Psychosis subjects had elevated SZ PGS versus controls; cases with SZ or BP diagnoses had stronger SZ or BP risk, respectively. There was no significant association within psychosis cases between individual symptom measures and overall PGS. However, neurotransmitter-specific pPGSs were moderately associated with specific endophenotypes; notably, glutamate was associated with SZ diagnosis and with deficits in cognitive control during task-based fMRI, while dopamine was associated with global functioning. Finally, unbiased endophenotype-driven clustering identified three diagnostically mixed case groups that separated on primary deficits of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognitive control. All clusters showed strong genome-wide risk. Cluster 2, characterized by deficits in cognitive control and negative symptoms, additionally showed specific risk concentrated in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Due to the intensive characterization of our subjects, the present study was limited to a relatively small cohort. As such, results should be followed up with additional research at the population and mechanism level. Our study suggests pathway-based PGS analysis may be a powerful path forward to study genetic mechanisms driving psychiatric endophenotypes.",2024
The metabolic overdrive hypothesis: hyperglycolysis and glutaminolysis in bipolar mania.,"Evidence from diverse areas of research including chronobiology, metabolomics and magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicate that energy dysregulation is a central feature of bipolar disorder pathophysiology. In this paper, we propose that mania represents a condition of heightened cerebral energy metabolism facilitated by hyperglycolysis and glutaminolysis. When oxidative glucose metabolism becomes impaired in the brain, neurons can utilize glutamate as an alternative substrate to generate energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis in astrocytes fuels the formation of denovo glutamate, which can be used as a mitochondrial fuel source in neurons via transamination to alpha-ketoglutarate and subsequent reductive carboxylation to replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Upregulation of glycolysis and glutaminolysis in this manner causes the brain to enter a state of heightened metabolism and excitatory activity which we propose to underlie the subjective experience of mania. Under normal conditions, this mechanism serves an adaptive function to transiently upregulate brain metabolism in response to acute energy demand. However, when recruited in the long term to counteract impaired oxidative metabolism it may become a pathological process. In this article, we develop these ideas in detail, present supporting evidence and propose this as a novel avenue of investigation to understand the biological basis for mania.",2024
Association of polygenic score and the involvement of cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways with lithium treatment response in patients with bipolar disorder.,"Lithium is regarded as the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), a severe and disabling mental health disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. Nevertheless, lithium is not consistently effective, with only 30% of patients showing a favorable response to treatment. To provide personalized treatment options for bipolar patients, it is essential to identify prediction biomarkers such as polygenic scores. In this study, we developed a polygenic score for lithium treatment response (Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub>) in patients with BD. To gain further insights into lithium's possible molecular mechanism of action, we performed a genome-wide gene-based analysis. Using polygenic score modeling, via methods incorporating Bayesian regression and continuous shrinkage priors, Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> was developed in the International Consortium of Lithium Genetics cohort (ConLi<sup>+</sup>Gen: N = 2367) and replicated in the combined PsyCourse (N = 89) and BipoLife (N = 102) studies. The associations of Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> and lithium treatment response - defined in a continuous ALDA scale and a categorical outcome (good response vs. poor response) were tested using regression models, each adjusted for the covariates: age, sex, and the first four genetic principal components. Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05. Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> was positively associated with lithium treatment response in the ConLi<sup>+</sup>Gen cohort, in both the categorical (P = 9.8 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>12</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 1.9%) and continuous (P = 6.4 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>9</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 2.6%) outcomes. Compared to bipolar patients in the 1<sup>st</sup> decile of the risk distribution, individuals in the 10<sup>th</sup> decile had 3.47-fold (95%CI: 2.22-5.47) higher odds of responding favorably to lithium. The results were replicated in the independent cohorts for the categorical treatment outcome (P = 3.9 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>4</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9%), but not for the continuous outcome (P = 0.13). Gene-based analyses revealed 36 candidate genes that are enriched in biological pathways controlled by glutamate and acetylcholine. Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> may be useful in the development of pharmacogenomic testing strategies by enabling a classification of bipolar patients according to their response to treatment.",2023
Glutamatergic Neurometabolite Levels in Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Studies.,"The glutamatergic system is thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). While there has been an increase in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies examining this neurotransmission system, the results are inconsistent. Possible reasons for the inconsistency, including clinical features such as mood state and childhood versus adulthood age, were not addressed in previous meta-analyses. This systematic review and meta-analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of BD included 40 studies, with 1135 patients with BD and 964 healthy control (HC) subjects. Glutamate plus glutamine and glutamine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with BD were significantly elevated compared with those of HC subjects (standardized mean difference = 0.42, 0.48, respectively). Subgroup analyses showed that adult BD patients had significantly higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine than adult HC subjects, but this was not the case in pediatric patients. For mood states, anterior cingulate cortex glutamate plus glutamine levels were higher in patients with bipolar depression than those in HC subjects. Our results imply that glutamatergic dysfunction in the anterior cingulate cortex may be implicated in the pathophysiology of BD, which is most evident in adult BD patients and patients with bipolar depression.",2023
The Mood Stabilizer Lithium Slows Down Synaptic Vesicle Cycling at Glutamatergic Synapses.,"Lithium is a mood stabilizer broadly used to prevent and treat symptoms of mania and depression in people with bipolar disorder (BD). Little is known, however, about its mode of action. Here, we analyzed the impact of lithium on synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling at presynaptic terminals releasing glutamate, a neurotransmitter previously implicated in BD and other neuropsychiatric conditions. We used the pHluorin-based synaptic tracer vGpH and a fully automated image processing pipeline to quantify the effect of lithium on both SV exocytosis and endocytosis in hippocampal neurons. We found that lithium selectively reduces SV exocytic rates during electrical stimulation, and markedly slows down SV recycling post-stimulation. Analysis of single-bouton responses revealed the existence of functionally distinct excitatory synapses with varying sensitivity to lithium-some terminals show responses similar to untreated cells, while others are markedly impaired in their ability to recycle SVs. While the cause of this heterogeneity is unclear, these data indicate that lithium interacts with the SV machinery and influences glutamate release in a large fraction of excitatory synapses. Together, our findings show that lithium down modulates SV cycling, an effect consistent with clinical reports indicating hyperactivation of glutamate neurotransmission in BD.",2023
The neuroprotective and neuroplastic potential of glutamatergic therapeutic drugs in bipolar disorder.,"The monoamine hypothesis has dominated research on the pathophysiology of mood disorders as well as the development of therapeutic drugs by over half a century. Nowadays a change of perspective is taking place. The glutamate system is increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The evidence spans from animal, post-mortem, imaging, pharmacological and genome-wide association studies. Bipolar disorder has been recently re-conceptualized as a synaptic plasticity-related disorder rather than simply as a result of deficits or excesses in individual neurotransmitters. A paradigm shift from a monoamine hypothesis to a neuroplasticity hypothesis focused on glutamate may represent a substantial advancement in the research for new drugs and therapies. In this review we summarize data from clinical and pre-clinical studies that have addressed glutamatergic alterations in bipolar disorder. Along with an in-depth discussion of glutamatergic alterations in bipolar disorder, we also report available data on the neuroprotective and neuroplastic potential of the classic mood stabilizers, ketamine, and psychedelics. The glutamatergic mechanisms underlying the efficacy of these drugs are described and discussed.",2022
Glutamatergic and N-Acetylaspartate Metabolites in Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Studies.,"The exact neurobiological mechanisms of bipolar disorder (BD) remain unknown. However, some neurometabolites could be implicated, including Glutamate (Glu), Glutamine (Gln), Glx, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) allows one to quantify these metabolites in the human brain. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to compare their levels between BD patients and healthy controls (HC). The main inclusion criteria for inclusion were <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies comparing levels of Glu, Gln, Glx, and NAA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and hippocampi between patients with BD in clinical remission or a major depressive episode and HC. Thirty-three studies were included. NAA levels were significantly lower in the left white matter PFC (wmPFC) of depressive and remitted BD patients compared to controls and were also significantly higher in the left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) of depressive BD patients compared to HC. Gln levels were significantly higher in the ACC of remitted BD patients compared to in HC. The decreased levels of NAA of BD patients may be related to the alterations in neuroplasticity and synaptic plasticity found in BD patients and may explain the deep white matter hyperintensities frequently observed via magnetic resonance imagery.",2022
Antidepressant chronotherapeutics normalizes prefrontal <sup>1</sup>H-MRS glutamate in bipolar depression.,"Dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission has been proposed both, as a biological underpinning of mood disorder and as a target for rapid-acting antidepressant treatments. Total sleep deprivation and light therapy (TSD + LT) can prompt antidepressant response in drug-resistant bipolar depression. Here we explored the effects of TSD + LT on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) glutamate and/or glutamine+glutamate (Glx) levels. We studied single voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measures of DLPFC Glu and Glx levels of 48 healthy participants and 55 inpatients with a major depressive episode in course of Bipolar Disorder, a subset of which (N = 23) underwent three cycles of repeated TSD + LT and were evaluated before and after treatment. Treatment effects of mood and on Glu and Glx concentrations were analyzed in the context of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), correcting for age, sex and ongoing lithium treatment. Higher concentration of Glu (adjusted Z = -2189, p = 0,0285) and Glx (adjusted Z = -3,13, p = 0,0017) were observed in BD patients compared to HC. Treatment caused a significant rapid reduction of depressive symptom severity over time (F = 63.98, p < 0.01). Change in depression levels after TSD + LT treatment was significantly influenced by delta change in Glu levels (LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.619, p = 0.0316) and in Glx levels (LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.486, p = 0.0341). A reduction in Glu and Glx levels associated with depression could contribute to the mechanism of action of TSD + LT, directly acting on glutamatergic neurons, or to the interaction between the glutamatergic system and dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels, known to be targeted by TSD. This is in line with several studies showing a glutamatergic modulation effects of antidepressants and mood stabilizing agents. This finding deepens our understanding of antidepressant effect of chronoterapeutics.",2022
Association between CACNA1C gene rs100737 polymorphism and glutamatergic neurometabolites in bipolar disorder.,"Abnormalities in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in Bipolar Disorders (BD) have been associated with impairments in glutamatergic receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels. Increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) glutamatergic neurometabolites have been consistently disclosed in BD by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CACNA1C gene (rs1006737), which encodes the alpha 1-C subunit of the L-type calcium channel, has been associated with BD and is reported to modulate intra-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, this study aimed to explore the association of the CACNA1C genotype with ACC glutamatergic metabolites measured by <sup>1</sup>H-MRS in both BD and HC subjects. A total of 194 subjects (121 euthymic BD type I patients and 73 healthy controls (HC) were genotyped for CACNA1C rs1006737, underwent a 3-Tesla <sup>1</sup>H-MRS imaging examination and ACC glutamatergic metabolite were assessed. We found overall increased glutamatergic metabolites in AA carriers in BD. Specifically, higher Glx/Cr was observed in subjects with the AA genotype compared to both AG and GG in the overall sample (BD + HC). Also, female individuals in the BD group with AA genotype were found to have higher Glx/Cr compared to those with other genotypes. CACNA1C AA carriers in use of anticonvulsant medication had higher estimated Glutamine (Glx-Glu) than the other genotypes. Thus, this study suggest an association between calcium channel genetics and increased glutamatergic metabolites in BD, possibly playing a synergic role in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and excitotoxicity.",2022
Transdiagnostic role of glutamate and white matter damage in neuropsychiatric disorders: A Systematic Review.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) have been considered distinct categories of diseases despite their overlapping characteristics and symptomatology. We aimed to provide an in-depth review elucidating the role of glutamate/Glx and white matter (WM) abnormalities in these disorders from a transdiagnostic perspective. The PubMed online database was searched for studies published between 2010 and 2021. After careful screening, 401 studies were included. The findings point to decreased levels of glutamate in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in both SZ and BD, whereas Glx is elevated in the Hippocampus in SZ and MDD. With regard to WM abnormalities, the Corpus Callosum and superior Longitudinal Fascicle were the most consistently identified brain regions showing decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across all the reviewed disorders, except GAD. Additionally, the Uncinate Fasciculus displayed decreased FA in all disorders, except OCD. Decreased FA was also found in the inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Thalamic Radiation, and Corona Radiata in SZ, BD, and MDD. Decreased FA in the Fornix and Corticospinal Tract were found in BD and SZ patients. The Cingulum and Anterior Limb of Internal Capsule exhibited decreased FA in MDD and SZ patients. The results suggest a gradual increase in severity from GAD to SZ defined by the number of brain regions with WM abnormality which may be partially caused by abnormal glutamate levels. WM damage could thus be considered a potential marker of some of the main neuropsychiatric disorders.",2022
"Results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multimodal-MRI pilot study of gabapentin for co-occurring bipolar and cannabis use disorders.","Disrupted brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate homeostasis is a promising target for pharmacological intervention in co-occurring bipolar disorder (BD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Gabapentin is a safe and well-tolerated medication, FDA-approved to treat other neurological diseases, that restores GABA/glutamate homeostasis, with treatment studies supporting efficacy in treating CUD, as well as anxiety and sleep disorders that are common to both BD and CUD. The present manuscript represents the primary report of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover (1-week/condition), multimodal-MRI (proton-MR spectroscopy, functional MRI) pilot study of gabapentin (1200 mg/day) in BD + CUD (n = 22). Primary analyses revealed that (1) gabapentin was well tolerated and adherence and retention were high, (2) gabapentin increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right basal ganglia (rBG) glutamate levels and (3) gabapentin increased activation to visual cannabis cues in the posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC, a region involved in response inhibition to rewarding stimuli). Exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes further found that in participants taking gabapentin versus placebo, (1) elevations of dACC GABA levels were associated with lower manic/mixed and depressive symptoms and (2) elevations of rBG glutamate levels and pMCC activation to cannabis cues were associated with lower cannabis use. Though promising, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution due to observed randomization order effects on dACC glutamate levels and identification of statistical moderators that differed by randomization order (i.e. cigarette-smoking status on rBG glutamate levels and pMCC cue activation). Nonetheless, they provide the necessary foundation for a more robustly designed (urn-randomized, parallel-group) future study of adjuvant gabapentin for BD + CUD.",2022
The Translational Potential of Non-coding RNAs and Multimodal MRI Data Sets as Diagnostic and Differential Diagnostic Biomarkers for Mood Disorders.,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) have a high prevalence and detrimental socio-economic consequences for the patients and the community. Furthermore, the depressive symptomatology of both disorders is essentially identical, thus rendering the clinical differential diagnosis between the two significantly more difficult considering the concomitant lack of objective biomarkers. Mood disorders are multifactorial disorders the pathophysiology of which includes genetic, epigenetic, neurobiological, neuroimmunological, structural and functional brain alterations, etc. Aberrant genetic variants as well as changed differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD and BD. MiRNAs as well as lncRNAs have regulatory and modulating functions on protein-- coding gene expression thus influencing the remodeling of the architecture, neurotransmission, immunomodulation, etc. in the Central Nervous System (CNS) which are essential in the development of psychiatric disorders including MDD and BD. Moreover, both shared and distinct structural, connectivity, task-related and metabolic features have been observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, suggesting the possibility of a dimensional continuum between the two disorders instead of a categorical differentiation. Aberrant connectivity within and between the Default Mode Network, the Salience Network, Executive Network, etc. as well as dysfunctional emotion, cognitive and executive processing have been associated with mood disorders. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore a more multidimensional framework in the scientific research of mood disorders, including epigenetic and neuroimaging data in order to shape an outline for their translational capacity in clinical practice.",2021
Neuronal cells from bipolar individuals are more susceptible to glutamate induced apoptosis than cells from non-bipolar subjects.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with marked parenchymal brain loss in a significant fraction of patients. The lack of necrosis in postmortem examination suggests an apoptotic process. Emerging evidence suggests that mood stabilizers, like lithium, have antiapoptotic actions. Glutamatergic abnormalities have been associated with BD. Olfactory neuroepithelial progenitors (ONPs) harvested by biopsy from type I bipolar patients (BD-ONPs, n = 3) and non-bipolar controls (non-BD-ONPs, n = 6), were treated with glutamate at concentrations sufficient to mimic the observed doubling of intracellular sodium known to occur in both mania and bipolar depression, to investigate potential differential lithium effect on both BD-ONPs and non-BD-ONPs. Apoptosis was detected in BP-ONPs exposed to 0.1 M glutamate for 6 h but in non-BD-ONPs at 24 h. Moreover, after treatment with 0.1 M glutamate treated for 6 h the levels of the pro-apoptotic cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP proteins were significantly higher in BD-ONPs compare to non-BD-ONPs. Pretreatment with a therapeutic concentration of 1 mM lithium for 3 days attenuated the glutamate induced apoptosis. Lithium pretreatment 3 days also prevented the DNA fragmentation induced by glutamate, and significantly increased the antiapoptotic phospho-B-Raf and Bcl-2 proteins in BD-ONPs compared to non-BD-ONPs. ONPs are obtained from subjects with and without bipolar illness, but outcome of their study may still not reflect the biology of the illness. ONPs derived from BD are more susceptible to glutamate-induced apoptosis. Lithium is associated with a greater increase of anti-apoptotic B-Raf and Bcl-2 expression in BD-ONPs.",2021
Synaptotagmin-7-mediated activation of spontaneous NMDAR currents is disrupted in bipolar disorder susceptibility variants.,"Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) plays direct or redundant Ca2+ sensor roles in multiple forms of vesicle exocytosis in synapses. Here, we show that Syt7 is a redundant Ca2+ sensor with Syt1/Doc2 to drive spontaneous glutamate release, which functions uniquely to activate the postsynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs that significantly contribute to mental illness. In mouse hippocampal neurons lacking Syt1/Doc2, Syt7 inactivation largely diminishes spontaneous release. Using 2 approaches, including measuring Ca2+ dose response and substituting extracellular Ca2+ with Sr2+, we detect that Syt7 directly triggers spontaneous release via its Ca2+ binding motif to activate GluN2B-NMDARs. Furthermore, modifying the localization of Syt7 in the active zone still allows Syt7 to drive spontaneous release, but the GluN2B-NMDAR activity is abolished. Finally, Syt7 SNPs identified in bipolar disorder patients destroy the function of Syt7 in spontaneous release in patient iPSC-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons. Therefore, Syt7 could contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders through driving spontaneous glutamate release.",2021
Novel Glutamatergic Modulators for the Treatment of Mood Disorders: Current Status.,"The efficacy of standard antidepressants is limited for many patients with mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel therapeutics. Both clinical and preclinical studies have implicated glutamatergic system dysfunction in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. In particular, rapid reductions in depressive symptoms have been observed in response to subanesthetic doses of the glutamatergic modulator racemic (R,S)-ketamine in individuals with mood disorders. These results have prompted investigation into other glutamatergic modulators for depression, both as monotherapy and adjunctively. Several glutamate receptor-modulating agents have been tested in proof-of-concept studies for mood disorders. This manuscript gives a brief overview of the glutamate system and its relevance to rapid antidepressant response and discusses the existing clinical evidence for glutamate receptor-modulating agents, including (1) broad glutamatergic modulators ((R,S)-ketamine, esketamine, (R)-ketamine, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine [HNK], dextromethorphan, Nuedexta [a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine], deudextromethorphan [AVP-786], axsome [AXS-05], dextromethadone [REL-1017], nitrous oxide, AZD6765, CLE100, AGN-241751); (2) glycine site modulators (D-cycloserine [DCS], NRX-101, rapastinel [GLYX-13], apimostinel [NRX-1074], sarcosine, 4-chlorokynurenine [4-Cl-KYN/AV-101]); (3) subunit (NR2B)-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (eliprodil [EVT-101], traxoprodil [CP-101,606], rislenemdaz [MK-0657/CERC-301]); (4) metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) modulators (basimglurant, AZD2066, RG1578, TS-161); and (5) mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activators (NV-5138). Many of these agents are still in the preliminary stages of development. Furthermore, to date, most have demonstrated relatively modest effects compared with (R,S)-ketamine and esketamine, though some have shown more favorable characteristics. Of these novel agents, the most promising, and the ones for which the most evidence exists, appear to be those targeting ionotropic glutamate receptors.",2021
"Alteration of plasma alanine, glutamate, and glycine Level: A potentiate manic episode of bipolar disorder.","The amino acids that function as co-agonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor have been investigated in bipolar disorder (BD). However, studies comparing amino acid levels in the plasma of BD patients with healthy controls have yielded inconsistent results. We, therefore, conducted a study in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia to determine the plasma levels of glutamate, glycine, and alanine in BD patients and compared them with the healthy controls. An overnight fast of 10-hour plasma levels of glutamate, glycine, alanine, and tryptophan were measured in 83 bipolar patients, and were compared to a group of 82 healthy controls. The mean (SD) age of bipolar patients was 40.9 (12.1), while the mean (SD) age for control groups was 35.6 (7.7) years. The median (25th, 75th percentile) of glutamate and alanine levels in bipolar patients was 111.0 (65.0,176.0) and 530.0 (446.0,629.0), respectively, while the mean (SD) of glycine level in bipolar patients was 304.0 (98.1). Significant higher glutamate, glycine, and alanine levels were found in bipolar disorder patients in the manic episode as compared to the healthy controls. Although the exact relationship between peripheral NMDA receptor co-agonist levels in the pathogenesis of BD is not well understood, these findings should be explored and may enlighten some new paths for BD therapy which could reward the patients also clinicians.",2021
N-acetylcysteine for depression and glutamate changes in the left prefrontal cortex in adolescents and young adults at risk for bipolar disorder: A pilot study.,"To investigate the mechanism of action of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in depressive symptoms in young individuals at familial risk for bipolar disorder. We conducted an 8-week open label clinical trial of NAC 2400 mg/days in 15-24 years old depressed offspring of a bipolar I disorder parent, with baseline and endpoint proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy acquired within the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Nine participants were enrolled and finished the study. NAC significantly improved depressive and anxiety symptom scores, and clinical global impression (all p < .001). There was a non-significant reduction in glutamate levels in the left VLPFC. Reduction in depressive symptom scores was positively associated with reduction in glutamate levels in the left VLPFC (p = .007). This pilot study suggests that NAC might be efficacious for depressive symptoms in at-risk youth, and that its mechanism of action involves the modulation of glutamate in the left VLPFC.",2022
Anterior cingulate cortex neurometabolites in bipolar disorder are influenced by mood state and medication: A meta-analysis of <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies.,"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region that mediates affect and cognition by connecting the frontal cortex to limbic structures, has been consistently implicated in the neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder (BD). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) studies have extensively compared in vivo neurometabolite levels of BD patients and healthy controls (HC) in the ACC. However, these studies have not been analyzed in a systematic review or meta-analysis and nor has the influence of mood state and medication on neurometabolites been examined in this cortical region. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies comparing ACC neurometabolite profiles of adult BD patients and HC subjects was conducted, retrieving 27 articles published between 2000 and 2018. Overall increased ACC levels of Glx [glutamine (Gln) + glutamate)/Creatine], Gln, choline (Cho) and Cho/Creatine were found in BD compared to HC. Bipolar depression was associated with higher Cho levels, while euthymia correlated with higher glutamine (Gln) and Cho. Mood stabilizers appeared to affect ACC Glu and Gln metabolites. Increased ACC Cho observed in euthymia, depression and in medication-free groups could be considered a trait marker in BD and attributed to increased cell membrane phospholipid turnover. Overall increased ACC Glx was associated with elevated Gln levels, particularly influenced by euthymia, but no abnormality in Glu was detected. Further <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies, on other voxels, should assess more homogeneous (mood state-specific), larger BD samples and account for medication status using more sensitive <sup>1</sup>H-MRS techniques.",2021
Mitochondrial dysfunction as a critical event in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.,"The understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) remains modest, despite recent advances in neurobiological research. The mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis of bipolar disorder has been corroborated by several studies involving postmortem brain analysis, neuroimaging, and specific biomarkers in both rodent models and humans. Evidence suggests that BD might be related to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, neuroimmune dysfunction, and atypical mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction in mood disorders is also associated with abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, glutamate excitotoxicity, an imbalance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins towards apoptosis, abnormal gene expression of electron transport chain complexes, and decreased ATP synthesis. This paper aims to review and discuss the implications of mitochondrial dysfunction in BD etiology and to explore mitochondria as a potential target for novel therapeutic agents.",2021
Effects of infliximab on brain neurochemistry of adults with bipolar depression.,"To explore the relationship between inflammation and neuronal metabolism in bipolar disorder (BD) by evaluating the neurochemical effects of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antagonist infliximab among individuals with bipolar depression METHODS: This is a post-hoc, exploratory analysis from a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with infliximab for adults with bipolar depression. We assessed the effects of infliximab on concentration of metabolites in the prefrontal cortex, using proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), as well as its association with clinical outcomes (i.e. depressive symptom severity and cognitive function). Eighteen participants in the placebo and 15 in the infliximab group were included in this analysis. In the pre-specified primary outcome, there were no significant effects of treatment on prefrontal concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA; p = 0.712). In the secondary analyses, there was a significant treatment by time interaction for glutamate (Glx; p = 0.018), indicating that Glx levels decreased in infliximab-treated patients, relative to placebo. Treatment group significantly moderated the association between changes in Glx levels and changes in a neurocognitive test (i.e. Digit Symbol Substitution Test; p = 0.014), indicating that in infliximab-treated participants reductions in Glx were associated with cognitive improvement. Treatment with infliximab did not affect prefrontal NAA concentration in adults with BD. Exploratory analysis suggested a potential effect of treatment on the glutamate system, a finding that should be confirmed and validated by additional studies.",2021
Synaptotagmin-7 deficiency induces mania-like behavioral abnormalities through attenuating GluN2B activity.,"Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) probably plays an important role in bipolar-like behavioral abnormalities in mice; however, the underlying mechanisms for this have remained elusive. Unlike antidepressants that cause mood overcorrection in bipolar depression, <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-targeted drugs show moderate clinical efficacy, for unexplained reasons. Here we identified Syt7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with bipolar disorder and demonstrated that mice lacking Syt7 or expressing the SNPs showed GluN2B-NMDAR dysfunction, leading to antidepressant behavioral consequences and avoidance of overcorrection by NMDAR antagonists. In human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons, Syt7 and GluN2B-NMDARs were localized to the peripheral synaptic region, and Syt7 triggered multiple forms of glutamate release to efficiently activate the juxtaposed GluN2B-NMDARs. Thus, while Syt7 deficiency and SNPs induced GluN2B-NMDAR dysfunction in mice, patient iPSC-derived neurons showed Syt7 deficit-induced GluN2B-NMDAR hypoactivity that was rescued by Syt7 overexpression. Therefore, Syt7 deficits induced mania-like behaviors in mice by attenuating GluN2B activity, which enabled NMDAR antagonists to avoid mood overcorrection.",2020
Glutamatergic Correlates of Bipolar Symptoms in Adolescents.,"<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> Prior studies demonstrate elevated cortical glutamate (Glu) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Studies assessing neurochemistry in early stages of bipolar illness before the emergence of manic symptoms are lacking. This study aimed to examine neurochemical correlates measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and a dimensional measure of bipolarity in a sample of depressed adolescents. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Adolescent participants (aged 13-21 years) underwent a semistructured diagnostic interview and clinical assessment, which included the General Behavior Inventory Parent Version (P-GBI), a 73-item, parent-rated assessment of symptoms and behaviors. <sup>1</sup>H-MRS scans of a left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) voxel (8 cm<sup>3</sup>) were collected using a two-dimensional <i>J</i>-averaged sequence to assess <i>N</i>-acetylaspartate (NAA), Glu, Glx (glutamate + glutamine), and NAA/Glx concentrations. We used generalized linear models to assess the relationships between P-GBI scores and metabolite levels in L-DLPFC. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Thirty-six participants (17 healthy controls, 19 depressed) underwent <sup>1</sup>H-MRS scans and clinical evaluation with the P-GBI. There was a significant negative relationship between P-GBI score and L-DLPFC NAA/Glx in the whole sample. However, the magnitude of the effect was small and statistical significance was lost after correcting for multiple comparisons. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> These preliminary results suggest that NAA/Glx may have utility as a marker of bipolar traits in healthy and depressed adolescents. If replicated, <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measures of glutamatergic metabolism anomalies might have a role in identifying depressed adolescents at risk for mixed symptom presentations or BD. Identifying bipolarity in the early stages of the disease would have a significant impact on treatment planning and prognosis. Further longitudinal studies should examine neurochemical correlates of mood state during the developmental emergence of BD.",2020
Antidepressant efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder and the role of its pharmacodynamic properties: A hypothesis based on data.,"The treatment of bipolar depression is one of the most challenging needs in contemporary psychiatry. Currently, only quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, lurasidone, cariprazine, and recently lumateperone have been FDA-approved to treat this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain elusive. The current study investigated whether the pharmacodynamic properties of cariprazine fit into a previously developed model which was the first to be derived based on the strict combination of clinical and preclinical data. The authors performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of cariprazine. The original model suggests that a constellation of effects on different receptors is necessary and that serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to play a significant role in acute bipolar depression. On the contrary, norepinephrine activity seems to be necessary. Probably the early antidepressant effect can be achieved through an agonistic activity at 5HT-1A and antagonism at alpha1 noradrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors, but the presence of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibition appears essential to sustain it. Overall, the properties of cariprazine fit well the proposed model and add to its validity. A point that needs further clarification is norepinephrine reuptake inhibition which is not yet fully studied for cariprazine.",2023

ErbB4 deletion in noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus induces mania-like behavior via elevated catecholamines.,"Dysfunction of the noradrenergic (NE) neurons is implicated in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BPD). ErbB4 is highly expressed in NE neurons, and its genetic variation has been linked to BPD; however, how ErbB4 regulates NE neuronal function and contributes to BPD pathogenesis is unclear. Here we find that conditional deletion of ErbB4 in locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons increases neuronal spontaneous firing through NMDA receptor hyperfunction, and elevates catecholamines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, <i>Erbb4</i>-deficient mice present mania-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased sucrose preference. These behaviors are completely rescued by the anti-manic drug lithium or antagonists of catecholaminergic receptors. Our study demonstrates the critical role of ErbB4 signaling in regulating LC-NE neuronal function, reinforcing the view that dysfunction of the NE system may contribute to the pathogenesis of mania-associated disorder.",2018
Evaluation of Neurotransmitter Alterations in Four Distinct Brain Regions After Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Deprivation (REMSD) Induced Mania-Like Behaviour in Swiss Albino Mice.,"A number of neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in contributing to the pathology of mood disorders, including those of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMSD) alters most of the neurotransmitters, which may have adverse behavioural changes and other health consequences like mania and other psychiatric disorders. The exact role of REMSD altered neurotransmitter levels and the manner in which emerging consequences lead to mania-like behaviour is poorly understood. Thus, we sought to verify the levels of neurotransmitter changes after 48, 72 and 96 h of REMSD induced mania-like behaviour in mice. We performed modified multiple platform (MMP) method of depriving the REM sleep and one group maintained as a control. To measure the hyperactivity through locomotion, exploration and behavioural despair, we performed the Open Field Test (OFT) and the Forced Swim Test (FST). Quantitative determinations of DA, 5-HT, NE and GABA concentrations in four distinct brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and pons) were determined by the spectrofluorimetric method. These experiments showed higher locomotion and increased swimming, struggling/climbing and decreased mobility among REMSD animals as well as disrupted concentrations of the majority of the studied neurotransmitters during REMSD. Our study indicated that REMSD results in mania-like behaviour in mice and associated disruption to neurotransmitter levels, although the exact mechanisms by which these take place remain to be determined.",2018

The noradrenaline metabolite MHPG is a candidate biomarker from the manic to the remission state in bipolar disorder I: a clinical naturalistic study.,"Remission is the primary goal of treatment for bipolar disorder I (BDI). Metabolites of noradrenaline and dopamine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid (HVA), respectively, are reduced by treatment with antipsychotics, but whether these phenomena are caused by antipsychotics or by the pathophysiology of BDI is not known. Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mood disorders have also been suggested. We conducted a multifaceted study in BDI patients to ascertain if biological markers are associated with the manic state. Patients with Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores >20 participated in the study. Final analyses involved 24 BDI patients (13 men and 11 women). We used YMRS scores to identify mania stages in individual BDI patients (i.e., manic syndrome, response and remission stages). Statistical analyses were done using one-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (rep-ANOVA) throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages. Plasma concentrations of MHPG and HVA were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma levels of BDNF were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BDI patients had significantly reduced plasma levels of MHPG throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages (rep-ANOVA, p = 0.002). Without a case of response state, there was a significant positive correlation between YMRS scores and plasma levels of MHPG (ρ = 0.33, p = 0.033, n = 48). Plasma levels of HVA and BDNF were not significantly altered throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages. These data suggest that the peripheral level of MHPG (which is associated with noradrenaline levels in the brain) could be used as a biomarker for the manic state in BDI. The MHPG level is likely to reflect the clinical characteristics of the manic syndrome in BDI, and noradrenaline may reflect the pathophysiology from manic to remission states.",2014
Is elevated norepinephrine an etiological factor in some cases of Parkinson's disease?,"It is well documented that norepinephrine (NE) releasing neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus that is a major source of NE for the brain, degenerate during the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). A number of studies also suggest that, as a result, there is less NE released in the brain during disease progression, which may contribute to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. This paper puts forth the novel hypothesis that NE degeneration in PD is preceded by elevated NE signaling, mainly as a result of genetics, and that this elevation is a major etiological factor in the disease. In this scenario, long-term (if not lifelong) elevated NE signaling could eventually invoke compensatory mechanisms that result in noradrenergic, and possibly dopaminergic, cell death. Several lines of evidence are briefly reviewed on the relationship between NE signaling and PD, including studies of: the level of NE; drugs that increase or decrease NE signaling; the relationship between PD and bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, since the latter three conditions may be associated with increased NE signaling; and the relationship between PD and psychological stress, since stress is associated with increased release of NE. Many of these studies support NE degeneration during the disease, although some are consistent with elevated NE signaling during disease progression. Because there are few data on the state of the NE system prior to disease onset, the central point of this paper that NE signaling is elevated prior to development of PD, remains largely hypothetical. If elevated NE signaling really is an etiological factor in this disease, then early identification of susceptible individuals and long-term treatment with NE transmission reducing drugs, may help prevent or slow progression of PD.",2014
Is elevated norepinephrine an etiological factor in some cases of schizophrenia?,"A number of hypotheses have been put forth regarding the etiology of schizophrenia, including the dopamine hypothesis, NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis, and others. A lesser known theory is that elevated noradrenergic signaling plays a causative role in the disease. This paper briefly re-examines the merits of this hypothesis, including as it relates to some recently published studies. Several lines of evidence are investigated, including: endogenous level studies of norepinephrine (NE); modulation of the disease by noradrenergic drugs; association of the disease with bipolar disorder and hypertension, since these latter two conditions may involve elevated NE transmission; and effects of psychological stress on the disease, since stress can produce elevated release of NE. For many of these lines of evidence, their relationship with prepulse inhibition of startle is examined. A number of these studies support the hypothesis, and several suggest that elevated NE signaling plays a particularly prominent role in the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia. If the hypothesis is correct for some persons, conventional pharmaceutical treatment options, such as use of atypical antipsychotics (which may themselves modulate noradrenergic signaling), may be improved if selective NE transmission modulating agents are added to or even substituted for these conventional drugs.",2014

Quetiapine for bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Quetiapine has been proposed for depression in bipolar patients but a quantitative analysis is lacking. In the present paper, we review and meta-analyze available data about the short-term and long-term efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder or bipolar depression. A literature research was carried out using three electronic databases. Studies providing measures of efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine, either as monotherapy or as augmentation, for bipolar depression were considered. Seven short-term studies and four maintenance studies were included. Short-term studies suggested that patients treated with quetiapine monotherapy were significantly more likely than patients treated with placebo and further active comparators to achieve higher response and remission rates as well as more clinical improvements at the endpoint. Such benefits were significant from the first weeks of treatment onward. Maintenance studies suggested that the combination of quetiapine and mood stabilizers was significantly better than placebo plus mood stabilizers for the prevention of both depressive and manic relapses. Quetiapine was generally well tolerated. Furthermore, several clinical variables moderated outcomes under investigation. In conclusion, quetiapine could have some advantages over traditional treatments for the treatment of bipolar depression.",2012
The role of the aminergic systems in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.,"Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major medical and social burden, but little is known about the specific pathophysiology of BPD. The key biogenic amines in the aminergic system include serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh). By analyzing these neurotransmitters, this chapter highlights three hypotheses in the pathophysiology of BPD: the biogenic amine hypothesis, the cholinergic-aminergic balance hypothesis, and the permissive hypothesis. Evidence from select studies of cerebrospinal fluid, postmortem subjects, neuroimaging, genetic factors, and pharmacological agents will be used to reconcile these hypotheses. Possible explanations for discrepancies in these hypotheses are given, and directions for future studies are suggested.",2011
Is elevated norepinephrine an etiological factor in some cases of epilepsy?,"It is well established that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) has anticonvulsant properties. However, NE may also have proconvulsant properties under some conditions, both in animal epilepsy models and in humans. This paper examines the hypothesis that this neurotransmitter has proconvulsant properties, where much of the pharmaceutical evidence comes from rodent models. In assessing the elevated NE epilepsy hypothesis, the following seven lines of evidence are examined that include studies of: (1) antidepressants that raise the level of NE; (2) clonidine and other alpha 2 adrenergic agonist drugs that lower the level of NE; (3) prazosin and other drugs that affect alpha adrenoceptors; (4) propranolol and other drugs that affect beta adrenoceptors; (5) pheochromocytoma, which is a rare cancer of the adrenal glands that can boost NE levels; (6) comorbidity of epilepsy with bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, where all four conditions may involve elevated NE; and (7) psychological stress, which is associated with increased release of NE. The body of evidence supporting the NE proconvulsant hypothesis is consistent with the notion that elevated, endogenous noradrenergic transmission is an etiological factor in some cases of epilepsy.",2010
Psychiatric concerns in pediatric epilepsy.,"Pediatric epilepsy is a common, chronic, and challenging physical illness for children and their families. This article provides a medical overview and discusses the cognitive functioning and psychosocial adjustment as well as the psychiatric management for children and adolescents with pediatric epilepsy. The management of these children involves establishing a collaborative health care approach, evaluating academic functioning, considering psychotherapy, and managing psychopharmacologic treatment. A thorough understanding of the biopsychosocial concerns in pediatric epilepsy can enable medical providers and mental health clinicians to promote resiliency and adaptation in children and their families facing troubling seizure disorders.",2010
Impulsivity in mania.,"Impulsivity, a breakdown in the balance between initiation and screening of action that leads to reactions to stimuli without adequate reflection or regard for consequences, is a core feature of bipolar disorder and is prominent in manic episodes. Catecholaminergic function is related to impulsivity and mania. Manic individuals have abnormal dopaminergic reactions to reward and abnormal responses in the ventral prefrontal cortex that are consistent with impulsive behavior. Impulsivity in mania is pervasive, encompassing deficits in attention and behavioral inhibition. Impulsivity is increased with severe course of illness (eg, frequent episodes, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts). In mixed states, mania-associated impulsivity combines with depressive symptoms to increase the risk of suicide. Clinical management of impulsivity in mania involves addressing interpersonal distortions inherent in mania; reducing overstimulation; alertness to medical-, trauma-, or substance-related problems; and prompt pharmacologic treatment. Manic episodes must be viewed in the context of the life course of bipolar disorder.",2009
[Quetiapin in bipolar disorders].,"Atypical antipsychotics are now widely used in the acute and long-term treatment in bipolar disorder. The role of atypical antipsychotics as acute agents, add-on medications; or as primary mood stabilizers in different phases of bipolar disorder is an important current research tendency. However, in bipolar disorder the mostly used indication of quetiapine is the management of acute manic phases, clinical data and the actual research results suggest that it may have both antidepressant and long-term antimanic effects. Quetiapine enhances the transmission of the central serotonergic networks, by its high antagonistic affinity for 5-HT(2A) and partial agonistic activity for the 5-HT(1A) receptors. The 5HT(1A) partial agonism causes an increase in the dopaminergic neurotransmission of the prefrontal cortex, and also, the affinity for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor brings a relative increase in extracellular noradrenergic release an tone in the prefrontal cortex. Latest research shows that quetiapine's main, active, human plasma metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine (norquetiapine), has a high inhibition affinity for the noradrenergic transporter. These data suggest that comparing to other atypical antipsychotics, norquetiapine may have a relatively strong antidepressant potential. Modifying the dopaminergic transmission by quetiapine's D2 receptor blocking activity results indirect mediating the cAMP-PKA and the arrestin-Akt-GSK-3 intracellular signal transduction pathways, which process may explain its long-term antimanic and mood stabilizing capability. Quetiapine's activity on nerve growth factors, histamine H1 receptor, proinflammatory networks may take an important additional part in its efficacy in bipolar depression. Its very fast dissociation from the D2 receptor is an important pharmakokinetic parameter for managing the optimal quetiapine dose in the daily clinical practice. This review tries to organize the actual information on quetiapine's multiplex activity in bipolar disorder.",2008
Norepinephrine and serotonin imbalance in the locus coeruleus in bipolar disorder.,"Abnormalities in norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) are implicated in bipolar disorder (BD). We examined 5-HT input and NE neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC, the NE nucleus that innervates the forebrain) in BD by quantifying immunoreactivity (IR) for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the biosynthetic enzymes for NE and 5-HT, respectively. Six suicides with BD were compared to matched normal controls and unipolar major depression suicides, using immunocytochemistry with computer-assisted quantification of immunoreactivity. Depressed bipolar suicides had 26.7 +/- 1.3% of LC area occupied by the TH immunoreactive (TH-IR) process, while controls had 50.7 +/- 8% (p = 0.002) and unipolar depressed suicides had 50.3 +/- 2.5% (p = 0.003). In bipolars, these processes did not stain as darkly (1.9 +/- 0.5 x background) as controls (2.9 +/- 0.9 x background; p = 0.01) or unipolars (2.9 +/- 0.6 x background; p = 0.002). Bipolar suicides also had less TPH-IR processes in the LC (11.7 +/- 10%) compared with controls (32.8 +/- 8.8%; p = 0.01) or unipolar suicides (30.3 +/- 8%; p = 0.02). The TPH-IR intensity did not differ between groups. We found less TH-IR and TPH-IR in the LC in depressed bipolar suicides, but not unipolar suicides, suggesting that both NE and 5-HT activity is lower in BD. Studies during manic or euthymic states will determine whether these changes are mood state dependent.",2008
New understanding of mechanisms of action of bipolar medications.,"The classical models of mood disorder pathophysiology and mechanism of antidepressant or mood stabilizing drug action focused on neurochemical deficits and the ability of medications to correct these deficits. Recent studies suggest alterations in neuroplasticity and cellular resiliency may be more closely related to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorders, as well as the mechanism of action related to effective treatments. Patients with mood disorders have been found to exhibit evidence of neuroplastic changes, such as reductions in hippocampal and cortical volume, glial and neuronal cell density, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor; chronic stress, a major precipitator of depression, has been shown to cause many of the same neuroplastic changes to occur in animal models. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating neuroplasticity and their relationship to the pathophysiology of depression may provide insights into how current treatments work and point to novel targets for more efficacious treatments for patients with mood disorders.",2008
Power based association analysis (PBAT) of serotonergic and noradrenergic polymorphisms in bipolar patients with suicidal behaviour.,"Suicidality is a major health concern worldwide particularly in affective disorder patients. Attempted suicide is familial. There is strong neurobiological evidence showing that serotonergic and noradrenergic dysfunction is implicated in suicidal behaviours. We will apply now a new family based association strategy aimed to explain the genetic influence in suicidal behaviour by power based association test statistics (PBAT) in 336 bipolar patients assessed for suicidality within nuclear families. By use of conditional power calculations, the approach screens all possible null hypotheses without biasing the nominal significance level, and it identifies the subset of phenotypes that has optimal power when tested for association by either univariate or multivariate family based association test (FBAT). Using this statistical approach (PBAT) we investigated polymorphisms in serotonergic and noradrenergic genes, considering suicidal behaviour severity instead of the dichotomous phenotype (presence of suicide attempt). COMT Val/Met polymorphism was not associated with suicide with high confidence (power=91%). On the other hand, the analysis of the other 12 markers in the adrenergic and serotonergic genes revealed that the TH allele tended towards association with higher severity of suicidal behaviour (p=0.060) but the power obtained was very low. The marginal finding of association between TH and severe suicidal behaviour are convergent with previous reports. On the other hand, our sample has enough power to exclude the other polymorphisms investigated as major candidate for suicidality in bipolar disorder.",2008
Panic comorbidity with bipolar disorder: what is the manic-panic connection?,"Bipolar/panic comorbidity has been observed in clinical, community and familial samples. As both are episodic disorders of affect regulation, the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala-mediated, plasticity-dependent emotional conditioning. Neuronal genesis and synaptic remodeling occur in the amygdala; bipolar and panic disorders have both been associated with abnormality in the amygdala and related structures, as well as in molecules that modulate plasticity, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). These biological elements are involved in behavioral conditioning to threat and reward. Panic attacks resemble the normal acute fear response, but are abnormally dissociated from any relevant threat. Abnormal reward-seeking behavior is central to both manic and depressive syndromes. Appetites can be elevated or depressed; satisfaction of a drive may fail to condition future behavior. These dissociations may be the result of deficits in plasticity-dependent processes of conditioning within different amygdala subregions. This speculative model may be a useful framework with which to connect molecular, cellular, anatomic and behavioral processes in panic and bipolar disorders. The primary clinical implication is that behavioral treatment may be critical to restore function in some bipolar patients who respond only partially to medications.",2006
Sleeping in? The impact of age and depressive sub-type on hypersomnia.,"While early morning wakening is held to be a classic feature of melancholia, we investigate the clinical observation that young patients with melancholia and bipolar depression tend to be more likely to report hypersomnia. We examine age-related rates of those two sleep disturbance patterns in a consecutive set of out-patients with differing depressive sub-types assessed over a 20-year period. Hypersomnia was more likely to be reported than early morning wakening across all age bands by those with non-melancholic depression. Hypersomnia was also more likely than early morning wakening in younger patients with melancholia and bipolar disorder but, with age, early morning wakening became the dominant pattern. The study was retrospective, undertaken in a sample attending a tertiary referral unit and artefactual determinants of the associations were not pursued. We speculate that hypersomnia may be a non-specific homeostatic coping response to stress and thus to the non-melancholic depressive disorders, but that this pattern is overruled by an early morning wakening pattern in the more biological depressive sub-types as the individual ages, perhaps reflecting a noradrenergic contribution.",2006

Atypical antipsychotics in bipolar depression: potential mechanisms of action.,"""Conventional"" antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are not recommended as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Although they are likely to provide effective symptom relief in combination with mood stabilizers, the risk of precipitating a switch to mania often complicates their use even as combination therapy. Recently, 2 psychotropic medications approved for treating acute mania, olanzapine and quetiapine, have also been shown to possess antidepressant activity without destabilizing mood and, as such, are potential mood stabilizers. This article aims to review the mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and newer agents that are effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. A number of mechanisms have been postulated to play a role in the effective treatment of bipolar depression, including targets as diverse as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and various second messenger signaling pathways. A review of the data reveals an important point of commonality among the antidepressant treatments, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Antidepressant treatments, such as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and electroconvulsive therapy, induce a reduction of 5-HT(2A) receptors. Both olanzapine and quetiapine not only are antagonists at this receptor but also induce downregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. It is possible that the antidepressant efficacy of these agents is mediated by this receptor, while the additional benefit of olanzapine and quetiapine over unimodal antidepressant treatments, in terms of stabilizing mood, may be provided by their concomitant dopamine D(2) antagonism. Further studies should be conducted to examine these hypotheses.",2005

"Thyroid, brain and mood modulation in affective disorder: insights from molecular research and functional brain imaging.","The efficacy resulting from adjunctive use of supraphysiological doses of levothyroxine has emerged as a promising approach to therapy and prophylaxis for refractory mood disorders. Most patients with mood disorders who receive treatment with supraphysiological doses of levothyroxine have normal peripheral thyroid hormone levels, and also respond differently to the hormone and tolerate it better than healthy individuals and patients with primary thyroid diseases. Progress in molecular and functional brain imaging techniques has provided a new understanding of these phenomena, illuminating the relationship between thyroid function, mood modulation and behavior. Thyroid hormones are widely distributed in the brain and have a multitude of effects on the central nervous system. Notably many of the limbic system structures where thyroid hormone receptors are prevalent have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. The influence of the thyroid system on neurotransmitters (particularly serotonin and norepinephrine), which putatively play a major role in the regulation of mood and behavior, may contribute to the mechanisms of mood modulation. Recent functional brain imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) with [ (18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated that thyroid hormone treatment with levothyroxine affects regional brain metabolism in patients with hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder. Theses studies confirm that thyroid hormones are active in modulating metabolic function in the mature adult brain, and provide intriging neuroanatomic clues that may guide future research.",2003
Dynamic Model of Serotonin Presynapse and Its Application to Suicide Attempt in Patients with Bipolar Disorder.,"Suicide attempts are prevalent among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Impaired serotonin (5-HT) system in the pathogenesis of suicide attempt is partially heritable. To quantify the combined effects of multiple genetic variants, we developed a dynamic model of the 5-HT presynapse with functionally integrated individual genetic variants. The model includes five genetic variants in 5-HT system genes (<i>TPH2</i>, <i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>MAOA</i>) and quantitatively assesses their influence on 5-HT synthesis, reuptake, and degradation. The model was validated on 140 unaffected individuals and tested on 101 BD patients. Predicted mean concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HT precursor, and degradation product were compared between BD patients with and without a history of attempted suicide, and unaffected individuals. The model consists of eight differential equations that describe the temporal concentration change of model outputs. Calculated concentrations in unaffected control individuals aligned with published experimentally measured values, validating our model. BD patients with a history of suicide attempt showed lower calculated concentrations of 5-HT degradation product 5-hydroxy-3-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) compared to unaffected individuals (<i>p</i> = 0.044). Additionally, higher calculated concentrations of free cellular 5-HT (<i>p</i> = 0.048) and stored 5-HT (<i>p</i> = 0.047), with the effect size d = 0.35, were observed when comparing suicide attempters to non-attempters.. Our approach illuminated a complex interplay of genetic variants in 5-HT system genes that contributes to the risk of suicide attempt, with quantitative and personalized outputs unattainable through genetic association studies.",2025
Impact of Serotonin Deficiency on Circadian Dopaminergic Rhythms.,"Physiology and behavior are structured temporally to anticipate daily cycles of light and dark, ensuring fitness and survival. Neuromodulatory systems in the brain-including those involving serotonin and dopamine-exhibit daily oscillations in neural activity and help shape circadian rhythms. Disrupted neuromodulation can cause circadian abnormalities that are thought to underlie several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar mania and schizophrenia, for which a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we show that genetically depleting serotonin in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice promotes manic-like behaviors and disrupts daily oscillations of the dopamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in midbrain dopaminergic nuclei. Specifically, while TH mRNA and protein levels in the Substantia Nigra (SN) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of wild-type mice doubled between the light and dark phase, TH levels were high throughout the day in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice, suggesting a hyperdopaminergic state. Analysis of TH expression in striatal terminal fields also showed blunted rhythms. Additionally, we found low abundance and blunted rhythmicity of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (Cck) in the VTA of knockout mice, a neuropeptide whose downregulation has been implicated in manic-like states in both rodents and humans. Altogether, our results point to a previously unappreciated serotonergic control of circadian dopamine signaling and propose serotonergic dysfunction as an upstream mechanism underlying dopaminergic deregulation and ultimately maladaptive behaviors.",2024
"Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Cariprazine in Pediatric Patients with Bipolar I Disorder or Schizophrenia.","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Cariprazine is a dopamine D<sub>3</sub>-preferring D<sub>3</sub>/D<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist approved to treat adults with schizophrenia and manic/mixed or depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. This sequential-cohort, dose-escalation study was the first to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profile of cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, desmethyl-cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl-cariprazine (DDCAR), in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This phase I open-label study enrolled patients with schizophrenia (13-17 years of age) or bipolar I disorder (10-17 years of age). Patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and had Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores ≥70 or Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores ≥20. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups to receive 6 weeks of cariprazine treatment through slow titration to 1.5, 3, or 4.5 mg/d or fast titration to 4.5 mg/d. Pharmacokinetics, adverse events (AEs), and various safety parameters were analyzed. Efficacy was evaluated as an exploratory outcome. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 50 participants were enrolled. Based on mean trough levels, steady state appeared to be reached within 1-2 weeks for cariprazine and DCAR and within 4-5 weeks for DDCAR. Systemic exposure of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR generally increased approximately in proportion to the increases in dose from 1.5 to 4.5 mg/d. The most frequent treatment-related, treatment-emergent AEs included sedation, parkinsonism, tremor, dystonia, and blurred vision. Improvements from baseline on the PANSS and YMRS were observed throughout treatment. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In this first investigation of cariprazine in a pediatric population with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with those observed in adults. Cariprazine appeared to be safe and tolerable in children and adolescents.",2022
Biomarker potential of hsa-miR-145-5p in peripheral whole blood of manic bipolar I patients.,"Bipolar I disorder (BD-I) is a type of bipolar spectrum disorder characterized by manic or mixed episodes. Detecting microRNA regulations as epigenetic actors in BD-I is important to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and reveal the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers. We evaluated the expression profile of six candidate miRNAs (hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-376a-3p, hsa-miR-3680-5p, hsa-miR-4253-5p, hsa-miR-4482-3p, and hsa-miR-4725) in patients with BD-I and in healthy controls (aged 11-50 years). We also determined the potential target genes of these miRNAs through in silico analysis. The diagnostic values of the miRNAs were calculated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Four miRNAs were upregulated (hsa-miR-376a-3p, hsa-miR-3680-5p, hsa-miR-4253-5p, hsa-miR-4482-3p) and hsa-miR-145-5p was downregulated in patients (p < 0.001). The target gene analyses showed that hsa-miR-145-5p specifically targets the dopamine decarboxylase (DDC) gene. The area under the curve of hsa-miR-145-5p was 0.987. Differential expression of five miRNAs in peripheral blood may be associated with the pathogenesis of BD-I, and hsa-miR-145-5p has potential as a BD-I biomarker. This miRNA can be used in dopamine-serotonin regulation and dose adjustment in drug therapy via the DDC gene.",2022
Serotonin 1A Receptor Binding of [11C]CUMI-101 in Bipolar Depression Quantified Using Positron Emission Tomography: Relationship to Psychopathology and Antidepressant Response.,"The pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) remains largely unknown despite it causing significant disability and suicide risk. Serotonin signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Treatment of the depressed phase of the disorder is limited. Previous studies have indicated that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR) may predict antidepressant response. A total of 20 participants with BD in a current major depressive episode and 16 healthy volunteers had PET imaging with [11C]CUMI-101, employing a metabolite-corrected input function for quantification of binding potential to the 5HT1AR. Bipolar participants then received an open-labeled, 6-week clinical trial with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in addition to their mood stabilizer. Clinical ratings were obtained at baseline and during SSRI treatment. Pretreatment binding potential (BPF) of [11C]CUMI-101 was associated with a number of pretreatment clinical variables within BD participants. Within the raphe nucleus, it was inversely associated with the baseline Montgomery Åsberg Rating Scale (P = .026), the Beck Depression Inventory score (P = .0023), and the Buss Durkee Hostility Index (P = .0058), a measure of lifetime aggression. A secondary analysis found [11C]CUMI-101 BPF was higher in bipolar participants compared with healthy volunteers (P = .00275). [11C]CUMI-101 BPF did not differ between SSRI responders and non-responders (P = .907) to treatment and did not predict antidepressant response (P = .580). Voxel-wise analyses confirmed the results obtained in regions of interest analyses. A disturbance of serotonin system function is associated with both the diagnosis of BD and its severity of depression. Pretreatment 5HT1AR binding did not predict SSRI antidepressant outcome.The study was listed on clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT02473250.",2022
Neglected but not negligible aspects of antidepressants and their availability in bipolar depression.,"Although many antidepressants are available, they are not always used appropriately. For appropriate use of antidepressants, the old concept of a linear dose-response relationship, in which the dose is linearly increased to achieve a sufficient antidepressant effect, should be reconsidered. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate on the safe and appropriate use of antidepressants in patients with bipolar depression. Antidepressants may be used under certain conditions in patients with bipolar depression. These neglected-but not negligible-aspects of antidepressants have been discussed herein. A narrative qualitative review RESULTS: Dose-response relationships of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not linear. They may be bell-shaped, with efficacy initially increasing with an increase in dose but decreasing when the dose is increased beyond a certain point. Despite using international diagnostic criteria, uncertainty remains on whether operationally diagnosed depression is latent bipolar I depression, latent bipolar II depression, or true depression. Furthermore, operationally diagnosed bipolar II depression may be latent bipolar I depression, true bipolar II depression, or depression with false hypomanic episodes. Manic/hypomanic switches are most likely to occur in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants, followed by those receiving serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and SSRIs, in that order. Also, these switches are most likely to occur in patients with bipolar I depression, followed by those with bipolar II depression and true depression, in that order. Considering the diagnostic subtype of bipolar depression and antidepressant properties may help to determine the optimal treatment strategy.",2021
Examining the underpinnings of loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials with positron emission tomography.,"Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) has long been considered to reflect central basal serotonin transmission. However, the relationship between LDAEP and individual serotonin receptors and transporters has not been fully explored in humans and may involve other neurotransmitter systems. To examine LDAEP's relationship with the serotonin system, we performed PET using serotonin-1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) imaging via [<sup>11</sup>C]CUMI-101 and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) imaging via [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB on a mixed sample of healthy controls (n ​= ​4: 4 females, 0 males), patients with unipolar (MDD, n ​= ​11: 4 females, 7 males) and bipolar depression (BD, n ​= ​8: 4 females, 4 males). On these same participants, we also performed electroencephalography (EEG) within a week of PET scanning, using 1000 ​Hz tones of varying intensity to evoke LDAEP. We then evaluated the relationship between LDAEP and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> or 5-HTT binding in both the raphe (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>)/midbrain (5-HTT) areas and in the temporal cortex. We found that LDAEP was significantly correlated with 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> positively and with 5-HTT negatively in the temporal cortex (p ​< ​0.05), but not correlated with either in midbrain or raphe. In males only, exploratory analysis showed multiple regions in which LDAEP significantly correlated with 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> throughout the brain; we did not find this with 5-HTT. This multimodal study partially validates preclinical models of a serotonergic influence on LDAEP. Replication in larger samples is necessary to further clarify our understanding of the role of serotonin in perception of auditory tones.",2020
Prediction of lithium treatment response in bipolar depression using 5-HTT and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> PET.,"Lithium, one of the few effective treatments for bipolar depression (BPD), has been hypothesized to work by enhancing serotonergic transmission. Despite preclinical evidence, it is unknown whether lithium acts via the serotonergic system. Here we examined the potential of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) pre-treatment binding to predict lithium treatment response and remission. We hypothesized that lower pre-treatment 5-HTT and higher pre-treatment 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding would predict better clinical response. Additional analyses investigated group differences between BPD and healthy controls and the relationship between change in binding pre- to post-treatment and clinical response. Twenty-seven medication-free patients with BPD currently in a depressive episode received positron emission tomography (PET) scans using 5-HTT tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB, a subset also received a PET scan using 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]-CUMI-101 before and after 8 weeks of lithium monotherapy. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were used to estimate binding potential, proportional to receptor availability. Fourteen patients with BPD with both [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]-CUMI-101 pre-treatment scans and 8 weeks of post-treatment clinical scores were included in the prediction analysis examining the potential of either pre-treatment 5-HTT or 5-HT1A or the combination of both to predict post-treatment clinical scores. We found lower pre-treatment 5-HTT binding (p = 0.003) and lower 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding (p = 0.035) were both significantly associated with improved clinical response. Pre-treatment 5-HTT predicted remission with 71% accuracy (77% specificity, 60% sensitivity), while 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding was able to predict remission with 85% accuracy (87% sensitivity, 80% specificity). The combined prediction analysis using both 5-HTT and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> was able to predict remission with 84.6% accuracy (87.5% specificity, 60% sensitivity). Additional analyses BPD and controls pre- or post-treatment, and the change in binding were not significant and unrelated to treatment response (p > 0.05). Our findings suggest that while lithium may not act directly via 5-HTT or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> to ameliorate depressive symptoms, pre-treatment binding may be a potential biomarker for successful treatment of BPD with lithium.

The fetal origins of mental illness.,"The impact of infections and inflammation during pregnancy on the developing fetal brain remains incompletely defined, with important clinical and research gaps. Although the classic infectious TORCH pathogens (ie, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes simplex virus) are known to be directly teratogenic, emerging evidence suggests that these infections represent the most extreme end of a much larger spectrum of injury. We present the accumulating evidence that prenatal exposure to a wide variety of viral and bacterial infections-or simply inflammation-may subtly alter fetal brain development, leading to neuropsychiatric consequences for the child later in life. The link between influenza infections in pregnant women and an increased risk for development of schizophrenia in their children was first described more than 30 years ago. Since then, evidence suggests that a range of infections during pregnancy may also increase risk for autism spectrum disorder and depression in the child. Subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated that both pregnancy infections and inflammation can result in direct injury to neurons and neural progenitor cells or indirect injury through activation of microglia and astrocytes, which can trigger cytokine production and oxidative stress. Infectious exposures can also alter placental serotonin production, which can perturb neurotransmitter signaling in the developing brain. Clinically, detection of these subtle injuries to the fetal brain is difficult. As the neuropsychiatric impact of perinatal infections or inflammation may not be known for decades after birth, our construct for defining teratogenic infections in pregnancy (eg, TORCH) based on congenital anomalies is insufficient to capture the full adverse impact on the child. We discuss the clinical implications of this body of evidence and how we might place greater emphasis on prevention of prenatal infections. For example, increasing uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine is a key strategy to reduce perinatal infections and the risk for fetal brain injury. An important research gap exists in understanding how antibiotic therapy during pregnancy affects the fetal inflammatory load and how to avoid inflammation-mediated injury to the fetal brain. In summary, we discuss the current evidence and mechanisms linking infections and inflammation with the increased lifelong risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in the child, and how we might improve prenatal care to protect the fetal brain.",2019
Abnormal Functional Relationship of Sensorimotor Network With Neurotransmitter-Related Nuclei via Subcortical-Cortical Loops in Manic and Depressive Phases of Bipolar Disorder.,"Manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder (BD) show opposite psychomotor symptoms. Neuronally, these may depend on altered relationships between sensorimotor network (SMN) and subcortical structures. The study aimed to investigate the functional relationships of SMN with substantia nigra (SN) and raphe nuclei (RN) via subcortical-cortical loops, and their alteration in bipolar mania and depression, as characterized by psychomotor excitation and inhibition. In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on healthy (n = 67) and BD patients (n = 100), (1) functional connectivity (FC) between thalamus and SMN was calculated and correlated with FC from SN or RN to basal ganglia (BG)/thalamus in healthy; (2) using an a-priori-driven approach, thalamus-SMN FC, SN-BG/thalamus FC, and RN-BG/thalamus FC were compared between healthy and BD, focusing on manic (n = 34) and inhibited depressed (n = 21) patients. (1) In healthy, the thalamus-SMN FC showed a quadratic correlation with SN-BG/thalamus FC and a linear negative correlation with RN-BG/thalamus FC. Accordingly, the SN-related FC appears to enable the thalamus-SMN coupling, while the RN-related FC affects it favoring anti-correlation. (2) In BD, mania showed an increase in thalamus-SMN FC toward positive values (ie, thalamus-SMN abnormal coupling) paralleled by reduction of RN-BG/thalamus FC. By contrast, inhibited depression showed a decrease in thalamus-SMN FC toward around-zero values (ie, thalamus-SMN disconnection) paralleled by reduction of SN-BG/thalamus FC (and RN-BG/thalamus FC). The results were replicated in independent HC and BD datasets. These findings suggest an abnormal relationship of SMN with neurotransmitters-related areas via subcortical-cortical loops in mania and inhibited depression, finally resulting in psychomotor alterations.",2020
Opposite effects of dopamine and serotonin on resting-state networks: review and implications for psychiatric disorders.,"Alterations in brain intrinsic activity-as organized in resting-state networks (RSNs) such as sensorimotor network (SMN), salience network (SN), and default-mode network (DMN)-and in neurotransmitters signaling-such as dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT)-have been independently detected in psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between such neurotransmitters and RSNs in healthy, by reviewing the relevant work on this topic and performing complementary analyses, in order to better understand their physiological link, as well as their alterations in psychiatric disorders. According to the reviewed data, neurotransmitters nuclei diffusively project to subcortical and cortical regions of RSNs. In particular, the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SNc)-related nigrostriatal pathway is structurally and functionally connected with core regions of the SMN, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related mesocorticolimbic pathway with core regions of the SN. The serotonergic raphe nuclei (RNi) connections involve regions of the SMN and DMN. Coherently, changes in neurotransmitters activity impact the functional configuration and level of activity of RSNs, as measured by functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/temporal variability of BOLD signal. Specifically, DA signaling is associated with increase in FC and activity in the SMN (hypothetically via the SNc-related nigrostriatal pathway) and SN (hypothetically via the VTA-related mesocorticolimbic pathway), as well as concurrent decrease in FC and activity in the DMN. By contrast, 5-HT signaling (via the RNi-related pathways) is associated with decrease in SMN activity along with increase in DMN activity. Complementally, our empirical data showed a positive correlation between SNc-related FC and SMN activity, whereas a negative correlation between RNi-related FC and SMN activity (along with tilting of networks balance toward the DMN). According to these data, we hypothesize that the activity of neurotransmitter-related neurons synchronize the low-frequency oscillations within different RSNs regions, thus affecting the baseline level of RSNs activity and their balancing. In our model, DA signaling favors the predominance of SMN-SN activity, whereas 5-HT signaling favors the predominance of DMN activity, manifesting in distinct behavioral patterns. In turn, alterations in neurotransmitters signaling (or its disconnection) may favor a correspondent functional reorganization of RSNs, manifesting in distinct psychopathological states. The here suggested model carries important implications for psychiatric disorders, providing novel and well testable hypotheses especially on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",2020
Serotonin depletion causes valproate-responsive manic-like condition and increased hippocampal neuroplasticity that are reversed by stress.,"Abnormal hippocampal neural plasticity has been implicated in behavioural abnormalities and complex neuropsychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD). However, the determinants of this neural alteration remain unknown. This work tests the hypothesis that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is a key determinant of hippocampal neuroplasticity, and its absence leads to maladaptive behaviour relevant for BD. Depletion of brain 5-HT in Tph2 mutant mice resulted in reduced behavioural despair, reduced anxiety, marked aggression and lower habituation in novel environments, reminiscent of bipolar-associated manic behaviour. Treatment with valproate produced a substantial improvement of the mania-like behavioural phenotypes displayed by Tph2 mutants. Brain-wide fMRI mapping in mutants revealed functional hippocampal hyperactivity in which we also observed dramatically increased neuroplasticity. Importantly, remarkable correspondence between the transcriptomic profile of the Tph2 mutant hippocampus and neurons from bipolar disorder patients was observed. Chronic stress reversed the emotional phenotype and the hippocampal transcriptional landscape of Tph2 mutants. These changes were associated with inappropriate activation of transcriptional adaptive response to stress as assessed by gene set enrichment analyses in the hippocampus of Tph2 mutant mice. These findings delineate 5-HT as a critical determinant in BD associated maladaptive emotional responses and aberrant hippocampal neuroplasticity, and support the use of Tph2-/- mice as a new research tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in bipolar disorder.",2018
A Preclinical Study of Casein Glycomacropeptide as a Dietary Intervention for Acute Mania.,"Casein glycomacropeptide is a peptide that lacks phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. This profile may enable it to deplete phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and subsequently the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Dopamine- and serotonin-depleting amino acid mixtures have shown promise as acute antimanic treatments. In this study, we explore the depleting effects on amino acids, dopamine and serotonin as well as its actions on manic-like and other behavior in rats. Casein glycomacropeptide and a selection of amino acid mixtures were administered orally at 2, 4, or 8 h or for 1 week chronically. Amino acid and monoamine levels were measured in plasma and brain and behavior was assessed in the amphetamine-hyperlocomotion, forced swim, prepulse inhibition, and elevated plus maze tests. Casein glycomacropeptide induced a time-dependent reduction in tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in brain and plasma which was augmented by supplementing with leucine. Casein glycomacropeptide +leucine reduced dopamine in the frontal cortex and serotonin in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum after 2 and 4 h. Casein glycomacropeptide+leucine also had antimanic activity in the amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion test at 2 h after a single acute treatment and after 1 week of chronic treatment. Casein glycomacropeptide-based treatments and a branched-chain amino acid mixture affected total tissue levels of dopamine in the frontal cortex and striatum and serotonin in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of rats in a time-dependent fashion and displayed antimanic efficacy in a behavioral assay of mania.",2018
Evaluation of Neurotransmitter Alterations in Four Distinct Brain Regions After Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Deprivation (REMSD) Induced Mania-Like Behaviour in Swiss Albino Mice.,"A number of neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in contributing to the pathology of mood disorders, including those of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMSD) alters most of the neurotransmitters, which may have adverse behavioural changes and other health consequences like mania and other psychiatric disorders. The exact role of REMSD altered neurotransmitter levels and the manner in which emerging consequences lead to mania-like behaviour is poorly understood. Thus, we sought to verify the levels of neurotransmitter changes after 48, 72 and 96 h of REMSD induced mania-like behaviour in mice. We performed modified multiple platform (MMP) method of depriving the REM sleep and one group maintained as a control. To measure the hyperactivity through locomotion, exploration and behavioural despair, we performed the Open Field Test (OFT) and the Forced Swim Test (FST). Quantitative determinations of DA, 5-HT, NE and GABA concentrations in four distinct brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and pons) were determined by the spectrofluorimetric method. These experiments showed higher locomotion and increased swimming, struggling/climbing and decreased mobility among REMSD animals as well as disrupted concentrations of the majority of the studied neurotransmitters during REMSD. Our study indicated that REMSD results in mania-like behaviour in mice and associated disruption to neurotransmitter levels, although the exact mechanisms by which these take place remain to be determined.",2018
Molecular network-selected pharmacogenomics in a case of bipolar spectrum disorder.,"Personal genomic analysis was used for molecular diagnosis and pharmacogenomics in a 53-year-old female suffering from alternating depressive and dysphoric episodes. A total of 52 genes and 108 SNPs were analyzed in the whole genome. Results from the pharmacogenomic analysis were consistent with the pharmacological history and indicate mutations associated with low monoaminergic tone, but also a hyperactive 5HT2A receptor, a feature that associates to a high probability of developing a bipolar condition, especially under 5-hydroxytryptamine potentiating pharmacology. This aligns with the patient developing dysphoria with high clomipramine. The pharmacokinetic genomics pointed out to some absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) alterations that can lower or nullify drug's activity. A personalized regimen was proposed, with a positive outcome after 1 year.",2017
Total sleep time and kynurenine metabolism associated with mood symptom severity in bipolar disorder.,"Chronic, low-level inflammation is associated with symptomatic bipolar disorder (BD) and with chronic insomnia. Disrupted sleep is a feature of episodes of both mania and depression. We examined the effect of neopterin, a marker of cellular immune activation, and kynurenine (KYN), an inflammatory byproduct of the serotonin pathway, on the association between total sleep time and depression severity in BD. Twenty-one symptomatic BD participants and 28 healthy controls (HC) were recruited and followed during usual clinical care. At baseline and after symptomatic recovery, total sleep time was objectively measured with actigraphy for 1 week and blood plasma was collected to measure the serotonin precursor tryptophan (TRP), KYN, the KYN/TRP ratio, and neopterin levels. Statistical analyses were conducted using chi-square, independent t tests and hierarchical linear multiple regression models. Total sleep time was correlated positively with depressive severity and negatively with manic severity. TRP was significantly reduced in BD participants compared to HC. KYN, TRP, and the KYN/TRP ratio were associated with depressive severity when total sleep time and body mass index (BMI) were included in the model. The KYN/TRP ratio trended towards a negative association with mania symptoms, controlling for BMI and total sleep time, in acutely symptomatic BD participants. Neopterin was not associated with sleep or mood severity. After usual clinical care, BD participants showed significantly decreased clinical symptoms but no significant differences in sleep phenotype or biomarkers. Inflammation, sleep, and mood are closely intertwined. Future research into the effect of inflammation on sleep in BD may lead to clinical markers of outcome.",2018
Serotonin in psychiatry: in vitro disease modeling using patient-derived neurons.,"Several lines of evidence implicate serotonin in the etiology of multiple psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Much of our current understanding of biological mechanisms underlying serotonergic alterations in mood disorders comes from animal studies. Innovation in induced pluripotent stem cell and transdifferentiation technologies for deriving neurons from adult humans has enabled the study of disease-relevant cellular phenotypes in vitro. In this context, human serotonergic neurons can now be generated using three recently published methodologies. In this mini-review, we broadly discuss evidence linking altered serotonergic neurotransmission in MDD and BD and focus on recently published methods for generating human serotonergic neurons in vitro.",2018
Genetic association analysis of serotonin and signal transduction pathways in suicide attempters from an Italian sample of psychiatric patients.,"Genetic factors have been reported to contribute to the liability of suicide. We aimed to investigate functional polymorphisms in eight genes (serotonin transporter, SLC6A4; receptors, 5HTR1A, 1B, 5HTR2A; Tryptophan Hydroxylase, TPH1, TPH2; Monoamine Oxidase, MAOA and G Protein Subunit Beta 3, GNB3) to investigate their predictive value for suicide. The possible confounding effects of gender and phenotypic patients dissection were also valued. A sample of 111 consecutive psychiatric inpatients was recruited and assessed using specific psychometric instruments. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral white blood cell samples and polymorphisms were genotyped by pyrosequencing technology. Although no differences were observed between allele and genotype frequencies for all polymorphisms and suicide attempt (SA), a polygenic risk score was detected for three genes HTR2A (A-1438G), TPH1 and TPH2 increasing the prediction of SA risk (Thresh=0.43, p=0.038, R<sup>2</sup>=0.053). Moreover some nominal associations were obtained after gender and phenotypic dissection stratification (TEMPS-A, TEMPs-H, GSMD, SHSS, GAF, CGI) for SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR), HTR1A (C-1019G), HTR2A (A-1438G), TPH1 (A799C) and GNB3 (C825T) genes, that were lost after Bonferroni correction. This is a first evidence that specific additive combinations of genes could increase the prediction of SA risk and that gender and phenotypic dissection could influence the association of the genes with SA. This could represent a further study also for future meta-analyses on larger samples.",2017
Dissecting Impulsivity: Brain Mechanisms and Neuropsychiatric Implications.,,2017
"Different patterns of dopaminergic and serotonergic dysfunction in manic, depressive and euthymic phases of bipolar disorder.","A variety of alterations in brain neurotransmitter systems has been proposed as the cause of bipolar disorder (BD). We conducted a PUBMED search, which provided a total of 45 in vivo investigations with PET and SPECT, in which binding to serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (R), 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R, dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), D<sub>1</sub>R, D<sub>2</sub>R, muscarinic M2R and nicotinic ß2-nAChR as well as dopamine synthesis and/or dopamine release were assessed in BD patients in the manic (6 studies, 39 patients, 77 controls), depressive (15 studies, 248 patients, 488 controls) or eu- thymic condition (18 studies, 265 patients, 293 controls) and in mixed collectives of BD patients (6 studies, 55 patients, 80 controls). The retrospective analysis revealed a complex pattern of dysregulations within and between neurotransmitter systems, which is causally linked to the acute and euthymic states of BD. While increased mesencephalic, limbic and parietotemporoccipital serotonin and increased frontal dopamine underlie mania, the depressive state is characterized by decreased frontal and limbic serotonin, increased frontal and limbic acetylcholine and increased frontal dopamine. Also in euthymia, no normalization of receptor and transporter densities was observed. Alterations of regulation states of bindings sites, however, act together to achieve a normalization of mesencephalic, limbic and cortical serotonin.",2017
Kynurenine pathway and white matter microstructure in bipolar disorder.,"Decreased availability of serotonin in the central nervous system has been suggested to be a central factor in the pathogenesis of depression. Activation of indoleamine 2-3 dioxygenase following a pro-inflammatory state could reduce the amount of tryptophan converted to serotonin and increase the production of tryptophan catabolites such as kynurenic acid, an antagonist of ionotropic excitatory aminoacid receptors, whose levels are reduced in bipolar disorder. Abnormalities in white matter (WM) integrity have been widely reported in BD. We then hypothesized that metabolites involved in serotoninergic turnover in BD could influence DTI measures of WM microstructure. Peripheral levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine, and 5-HIAA were analysed in 22 patients affected by BD and 15 healthy controls. WM microstructure was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics with threshold-free cluster enhancement only in bipolar patients. We observed that kynurenic acid and 5-HIAA were reduced in BD and associated with DTI measures of WM integrity in several association fibres: inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle, corpus callosum, uncus, anterior thalamic radiation and corona radiata. Our results seem to suggest that higher levels of 5-HIAA, a measure of serotonin levels, and higher levels of kynurenic acid, which protects from glutamate excitotoxicity, could exert a protective effect on WM microstructure. Reduced levels of these metabolites in BD thus seem to confirm a crucial role of serotonin turnover in BD pathophysiology.",2018
Integrated theory to unify status among schizophrenia and manic depressive illness.,"Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and has been associated with both schizophrenia and depression. Although decreased serotonin activity has been reported in both depression and mania, it is important to investigate the interaction between serotonin and other neurotransmitter systems. There are competitive relationships between branched-chain amino acids, and tryptophan and tyrosine that relate to physical activity, and between L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), both highly dependent on intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations. Here, I propose a chaos theory for schizophrenia, mania, and depression using the competitive interaction between tryptophan and tyrosine with regard to the blood-brain barrier and coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin. Mania may be due to the initial conditions of physical hyperactivity and hypofunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing increased dopamine. Depression may be due to the initial conditions of physical hypoactivity and hypofunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing decreased serotonin. Psychomotor excitation may be due to the initial conditions of physical hyperactivity and hyperfunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing increased serotonin and substantially increased dopamine. The hallucinatory-paranoid state may be due to the initial conditions of physical hypoactivity and hyperfunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing increased serotonin and dopamine.",2015
Preliminary Transcriptome Analysis in Lymphoblasts from Cluster Headache and Bipolar Disorder Patients Implicates Dysregulation of Circadian and Serotonergic Genes.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) and cluster headache (CH) are distinct conditions with important similarities such as a temporal pattern of disturbances, dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle, and response to lithium treatment in a proportion of patients. Aiming to identify common transcription signatures in these two disorders, we carried out an exploratory microarray gene expression analysis in lymphoblasts from 8 CH and 10 BD I patients selected for positive response to lithium and 10 healthy controls (CO). Gene expression levels of BD and CH were compared with CO to create two lists of differentially expressed genes. We then matched the two lists and focus on genes showing statistically significant difference and same change direction in both disorders. RNA binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) was the most significantly altered gene in the list (3.17 × 10(-13) in BD, 9.44 × 10(-14) in CH). Pathway analysis identified protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum as the most significantly enriched. For validation with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using the same samples, we selected seven genes. Among these, we were able to validate the RBM3, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1), and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1). These genes encode for elements involved in circadian rhythm regulation (RBM3 and NR1D1) and in serotonin synthesis (TPH1), processes previously involved in both disorders, and in the mechanism of action of lithium.",2015
"Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action, part 2: relevance for ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior.","Serotonin regulates a wide variety of brain functions and behaviors. Here, we synthesize previous findings that serotonin regulates executive function, sensory gating, and social behavior and that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior all share in common defects in these functions. It has remained unclear why supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D improve cognitive function and behavior in these brain disorders. Here, we propose mechanisms by which serotonin synthesis, release, and function in the brain are modulated by vitamin D and the 2 marine omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is transcriptionally activated by vitamin D hormone. Inadequate levels of vitamin D (∼70% of the population) and omega-3 fatty acids are common, suggesting that brain serotonin synthesis is not optimal. We propose mechanisms by which EPA increases serotonin release from presynaptic neurons by reducing E2 series prostaglandins and DHA influences serotonin receptor action by increasing cell membrane fluidity in postsynaptic neurons. We propose a model whereby insufficient levels of vitamin D, EPA, or DHA, in combination with genetic factors and at key periods during development, would lead to dysfunctional serotonin activation and function and may be one underlying mechanism that contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and depression. This model suggests that optimizing vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake may help prevent and modulate the severity of brain dysfunction.",2015
"Adolescent angst or true intent? Suicidal behavior, risk, and neurobiological mechanisms in depressed children and teenagers taking antidepressants.","Suicide is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality amongst children and adolescents. In 2004 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ""black-box"" warning for antidepressants in children and adolescents, stating that these drugs may increase suicidality, a term encompassing both suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in the first few weeks of treatment. The warning was extended in 2007 to antidepressants prescribed to adults aged 25 and under. The evidence behind this decision stemmed from meta-analyses of antidepressant clinical trials that demonstrated a slight increase in suicidality in those receiving antidepressants versus those treated with a placebo. Due to methods of this pooled data compilation, the relationship between antidepressants and suicidality remains controversial. This report investigates a case where a 14 year old with major depressive disorder (MDD) developed suicidal ideation shortly after being prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Investigating the role antidepressants may play in suicidality suggests the need to explore the neurobiological mechanisms within the serotonin system. This case and its theoretical explanations attempt to bridge the gap between neurobiology and pharmacology in order to better delineate the etiology of this adverse effect.",2014
"A novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor induces antidepressant, pro-cognitive, and anti-anhedonic effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats: The role of the ghrelin-dopamine cascade.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often treatment resistant, particularly in addressing anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Novel pharmacological strategies are needed. While butyrylcholinesterase, ghrelin, and dopamine (DA) have been well studied in the context of stress and MDD, their interaction remains unclear. The dose-dependent antidepressant effects of a novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor (BChEI) were evaluated in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model of MDD. Behavioural assessments included the forced swim test (despair), sucrose preference test (reward-related), and novel object recognition test (cognition). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acetylcholine (ACh), and brain monoamines were analysed, as well as serum growth hormone and acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin. To confirm the role of ghrelin, pharmacological exploration was undertaken using the ghrelin receptor antagonist, D-Lys-3-GHRP-6. FSL rats had significantly lower ghrelin ratios, BDNF, ACh, DA and growth hormone levels. In FSL rats, both BChEI and escitalopram significantly reduced despair. BChEI significantly outperformed escitalopram in enhancing reward-related and cognitive behaviours. Biochemically, BChEI treatment significantly increased ghrelin ratios and brain DA levels without altering brain 5-HT, ACh or BDNF. D-Lys-3-GHRP-6 significantly reversed the antidepressant-like, rewarding, and pro-cognitive effects of BChEI, accompanied by significant reductions in BDNF and DA. FSL rats display impaired ghrelin, DA, serotonin, growth hormone, and BDNF signalling, akin to MDD. BChEI exerts antidepressant-like effects across despair, reward, and cognitive domains, most likely via the BChE-ghrelin-DA cascade. Reversal of these effects by ghrelin antagonism underscores the critical role of ghrelin, specifically via growth hormone secretagogue receptor-ghrelin interaction. These findings suggest a potentially novel multimodal neurobiological target for the treatment of MDD.",2025
Attempting to Increase the Effectiveness of the Antidepressant Trazodone Hydrochloride Drug Using π-Acceptors.,"Major depressive disorder is a prevalent mood illness that is mildly heritable. Cases with the highest familial risk had recurrence and onset at a young age. Trazodone hydrochloride is an antidepressant medicine that affects the chemical messengers in the brain known as neurotransmitters, which include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. In the present research, in solid and liquid phases, the 1:1 charge-transfer complexes between trazodone hydrochloride (TZD) and six different π-acceptors were synthesized and investigated using different microscopic techniques. The relation of dative ion pairs [TZD+, A-], where A is the acceptor, was inferred via intermolecular charge-transfer complexes. Additionally, a molecular docking examination was utilized to compare the interactions of protein receptors (serotonin-6BQH) with the TZD alone or in combination with the six distinct acceptor charge-transfer complexes. To refine the docking results acquired from AutoDock Vina and to better examine the molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions, a 100 ns run of molecular dynamics simulation was used. All the results obtained in this study prove that the 2,6-dichloroquinone-4-chloroimide (DCQ)/TZD complex interacts with serotonin receptors more efficiently than reactant donor TZD only and that [(TZD)(DCQ)]-serotonin has the highest binding energy value of all π-acceptor complexes.",2022
Short-term salicylate treatment improves microvascular endothelium-dependent dilation in young adults with major depressive disorder.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated reductions in nitric oxide (NO)-dependent dilation are evident in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the upstream mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation-induced ROS production contributes to microvascular endothelial dysfunction in MDD. Thirteen treatment-naive adults with MDD (6 women; 19-23 yr) and 10 healthy nondepressed adults (HAs; 5 women; 20-25 yr) were tested before and after (open-label design) systemic NF-κB knockdown (nonacetylated salicylate; 3,000-4,500 mg/day × 4 days). Red cell flux (laser Doppler flowmetry) was measured during graded intradermal microdialysis perfusion of the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine (ACh), alone and in combination with NO synthase inhibition [<i>N</i><sup>G</sup>-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)] or ROS scavenging (apocynin). Serum salicylate concentrations following treatment were not different between groups (22.8 ± 7.4 HAs vs. 20.8 ± 4.3 mg/dL MDD; <i>P</i> = 0.46). When compared with HAs, the NO-dependent component of ACh-induced dilation was blunted in adults with MDD before (<i>P</i> = 0.023), but not after (<i>P</i> = 0.27), salsalate treatment. In adults with MDD, the magnitude of improvement in endothelium-dependent dilation following salsalate treatment was inversely related to the degree of functional impairment at baseline (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.43; <i>P</i> = 0.025). Localized ROS scavenging improved NO-dependent dilation before (<i>P</i> < 0.01), but not after (<i>P</i> > 0.05), salsalate treatment. Salsalate did not alter systemic concentrations of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). These data suggest that NF-κB activation, via increased vascular ROS production, contributes to blunted NO-dependent dilation in young adults with MDD but otherwise free of clinical disease. These data provide the first direct evidence for a mechanistic role of vascular inflammation-associated endothelial dysfunction in human depression.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Our data indicate that short-term treatment with therapeutic doses of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor salsalate improved nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). In adults with MDD, acute localized scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with apocynin improved NO-dependent dilation before, but not after, salsalate administration. These data suggest that activation of NF-κB, in part via stimulation of vascular ROS production, contributes to blunted NO-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation in young adults with MDD.",2022
Cholinergic regulation of mood: from basic and clinical studies to emerging therapeutics.,"Mood disorders are highly prevalent and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression remain poorly understood, although theories regarding dysfunction within various neurotransmitter systems have been postulated. Over 50 years ago, clinical studies suggested that increases in central acetylcholine could lead to depressed mood. Evidence has continued to accumulate suggesting that the cholinergic system has a important role in mood regulation. In particular, the finding that the antimuscarinic agent, scopolamine, exerts fast-onset and sustained antidepressant effects in depressed humans has led to a renewal of interest in the cholinergic system as an important player in the neurochemistry of major depression and bipolar disorder. Here, we synthesize current knowledge regarding the modulation of mood by the central cholinergic system, drawing upon studies from human postmortem brain, neuroimaging, and drug challenge investigations, as well as animal model studies. First, we describe an illustrative series of early discoveries which suggest a role for acetylcholine in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Then, we discuss more recent studies conducted in humans and/or animals which have identified roles for both acetylcholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in different mood states, and as targets for novel therapies.",2019
Reduced Vesicular Acetylcholine Transporter favors antidepressant behaviors and modulates serotonin and dopamine in female mouse brain.,"Depression is extremely harmful to modern society. Despite its complex spectrum of symptoms, previous studies have mostly focused on the monaminergic system in search of pharmacological targets. However, other neurotransmitter systems have also been linked to the pathophysiology of depression. In this study, we provide evidence for a role of the cholinergic system in depressive-like behavior of female mice. We evaluated mice knockdown for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT KD mice), which have been previously shown to exhibit reduced cholinergic transmission. Animals were subjected to the tail suspension and marble burying tests, classical paradigms to assess depressive-like behaviors and to screen for novel antidepressant drugs. In addition, brain levels of serotonin and dopamine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. We found that female homozygous VAChT KD mice spent less time immobile during tail suspension and buried less marbles, indicating a less depressive phenotype. These differences in behavior were reverted by central, but not peripheral, acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Moreover, female homozygous VAChT KD mice exhibited higher levels of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum, and increased dopamine in the hippocampus. Our study thus shows a connection between depressive-like behaviors and the cholinergic system, and that the latter interacts with the monoaminergic system.",2017
Selective corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptor antagonist E2508 has potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like properties in rodent models.,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress, and CRF antagonists may be effective for the treatment of stress-related disorders including major depressive and anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated the in vivo pharmacological profile of N-cyclopropylmethyl-7-(2,6-dimethoxy-4-methoxymethylphenyl)-2-ethyl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylmethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-amine tosylate (E2508), a recently synthesized, orally active CRF1 receptor antagonist. Oral administration of a single dose of E2508 (3 or 10mg/kg), but not fluoxetine (30mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), significantly shortened immobility time in rats in the forced swim test. E2508 (10, 30, or 100mg/kg) also showed an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test in mice, with no sedative or muscle relaxant effects for doses up to 100mg/kg. Moreover, E2508 (5 or 20mg/kg) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in the rat defensive burying test. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, also showed an anxiolytic effect in the defensive burying test at the same dose that induced a muscle relaxant effect in mice. Administration of E2508 (30mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days did not affect sexual behavior. By contrast, fluoxetine (30mg/kg) administration for ≥7 consecutive days decreased sexual behavior. These results indicate that E2508 has both potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models, and is well tolerated compared with a commonly prescribed therapeutic SSRI or benzodiazepine.",2016
Behavior and the cholinergic parameters in olfactory bulbectomized female rodents: Difference between rats and mice.,"Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in rodents induces a wide spectrum of functional disturbances, including behavioral, neurochemical, and neuromorphological alterations. We have examined the effects of OBX on behavior and the parameters of the cholinergic system in female rats and mice. In rats, OBX resulted in the appearance of some depressive-like behavioral marks, such as the decreased sucrose consumption, hyperactivity, impaired short-term memory and anxiety-like behavioral features, such as shortened presence in the center of the open field arena or open arms of the elevated plus-maze and an enhancement of avoidance behavior. These behavioral abnormalities could be associated with disturbances in hippocampal function, this suggestion being supported by the presence of cellular changes in this brain structure. No effect of OBX on the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band as well as on the acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity in the septum, hippocampus, and neocortex could be detected. In contrast, in mice, OBX impaired spontaneous alternation behavior and decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band. These data demonstrate that rats and mice differently respond to OBX, in particular, OBX does not significantly affect the cholinergic system in rats.",2016
Ventral tegmental area cholinergic mechanisms mediate behavioral responses in the forced swim test.,"Recent studies revealed a causal link between ventral tegmental area (VTA) phasic dopamine (DA) activity and pro-depressive and antidepressant-like behavioral responses in rodent models of depression. Cholinergic activity in the VTA has been demonstrated to regulate phasic DA activity, but the role of VTA cholinergic mechanisms in depression-related behavior is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine whether pharmacological manipulation of VTA cholinergic activity altered behavioral responding in the forced swim test (FST) in rats. Here, male Sprague-Dawley rats received systemic or VTA-specific administration of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (systemic; 0.06 or 0.125mg/kg, intra-cranial; 1 or 2μg/side), the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antagonist scopolamine (2.4 or 24μg/side), or the nicotinic AChR antagonist mecamylamine (3 or 30μg/side), prior to the FST test session. In control experiments, locomotor activity was also examined following systemic and intra-cranial administration of cholinergic drugs. Physostigmine administration, either systemically or directly into the VTA, significantly increased immobility time in FST, whereas physostigmine infusion into a dorsal control site did not alter immobility time. In contrast, VTA infusion of either scopolamine or mecamylamine decreased immobility time, consistent with an antidepressant-like effect. Finally, the VTA physostigmine-induced increase in immobility was blocked by co-administration with scopolamine, but unaltered by co-administration with mecamylamine. These data show that enhancing VTA cholinergic tone and blocking VTA AChRs has opposing effects in FST. Together, the findings provide evidence for a role of VTA cholinergic mechanisms in behavioral responses in FST.",2015
Relationship of endothelial function and atherosclerosis to treatment response in late-life depression.,"Treatment response in late-life depression has been linked to cerebrovascular disease notably via the vascular depression hypothesis. This study investigated the relationship between endothelial function and atherosclerosis and treatment response to antidepressant monotherapy. Twenty five patients with late-life depression were compared with 21 non-depressed control subjects in a case control study. Nine of the depressed subjects were responders to antidepressant monotherapy and 16 were not. Vascular measures included assessment of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) representing atherosclerosis and biopsied small artery dilatation to acetylcholine to assess endothelial function in a subset of subjects. There were no group differences in vascular risks or sociodemographic variables. There was a significant group difference (responders versus non-responders versus controls) on both IMT and endothelial function (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) with a significant difference between controls and non-responders (p < 0.001) on IMT and between controls and responders (p < 0.05) and control versus non-responders (p < 0.05) on endothelial function but no significant difference between responders and non-responders. On both IMT and endothelial function, there was a gradient across groups, with control subjects having best vascular structure or function, non-responders worse and responders in-between. The results are consistent with a hypothesis that poorer antidepressant response in later life depressive disorder may be linked to an underlying vascular dysfunction and pathology. The study is small, and the results require replication but if confirmed, trials with vasoprotective medication aimed at improving vascular function in order to alter the prognosis of late-life depression would be a rational development.",2012
Fluoxetine effect on aortic nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation in the unpredictable chronic mild stress model of depression in mice.,"Major depression is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which depression may induce cardiovascular events is unclear. Endothelial dysfunction has been reported as a possible link between depression and subsequent cardiovascular events as described in depressed subjects. The purpose of this study was to investigate endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis formation in the aorta of mice exposed to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) procedure. BALB/c mice were exposed to two 7-week UCMS procedures separated by 6 weeks. Treatments (fluoxetine 10 mg/kg; NaCl 0.9%) started at the third week until the end of the seventh week of each procedure. Endothelial function was evaluated by in vitro assessment of acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in aortic rings. By using specific inhibitors for nitric oxide (NO)- and prostacyclin-dependent relaxation, we assessed the part played by NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-like mediators in endothelium-dependent relaxation. Atherosclerosis was evaluated by histological examination. Depression-like behavior was increased in the UCMS versus unstressed group and was reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatment. Vascular reactivity study indicated that UCMS induced a decrease in the NO-dependent relaxation that was partially compensated by an EDHF-like dependent relaxation. Because fluoxetine per se increased the NO-dependent relaxation, fluoxetine was able to reverse UCMS effect on the NO component and abolished the EDHF-like component. Atherosclerotic lesion was found in aorta of UCMS and nonstressed animals. As an independent risk factor, UCMS reproduced the endothelial alterations observed in depression but was not sufficient to provoke morphological alterations.",2012
IgM-mediated autoimmune responses directed against multiple neoepitopes in depression: new pathways that underpin the inflammatory and neuroprogressive pathophysiology.,"There is evidence that depression is accompanied by oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), as indicated by increased free radical levels, lipid peroxidation, and lowered antioxidant levels. The aims of the present study are to examine whether depression is accompanied by autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are formed following O&NS damage; and b) the major anchorage molecules, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. We examined serum IgM antibodies to the conjugated fatty acids, palmitic and myristic acids; acetylcholine; S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and NO-modified adducts in 26 depressed patients and 17 normal controls. Severity of depression was measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and severity of fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale. The prevalences and mean values for the serum IgM levels directed against conjugated palmitic and myristic acids, acetylcholine, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and the conjugated NO adducts, NO-tyrosine, NO-phenylalanine, NO-aspartate, NO-histidine, and NO-creatine were significantly higher in depressed patients than in normal controls. The autoimmune responses were significantly related to FF symptoms, such as fatigue and a flu-like malaise, whereas the indicants of nitrosative stress were related to gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. Depression is characterized by IgM-related autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are normally not detected by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids, and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. These autoimmune responses play a role in the inflammatory and O&NS pathophysiology of depression and may mediate the cellular dysfunctions that contribute to neuroprogression, e.g. aberrations in signal transduction, cellular differentiation and apoptosis.",2011
Nicotine receptors and depression: revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis.,"There is a well-established connection between smoking and depression. Depressed individuals are over-represented among smokers, and ex-smokers often experience increased depressive symptoms immediately after stopping smoking. Nicotine in tobacco binds, activates and desensitizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), but it is not known whether activation or desensitization is more important for the effects of nicotine on depressive symptoms. Here we review, based on clinical and preclinical studies of nicotinic drugs, the hypothesis that blockade (rather than activation) of neuronal nAChRs might be important for the effects of nicotinic agents on depressive symptoms. The endogenous neurotransmitter for nAChRs is acetylcholine, and the effects of nicotine on depression-like behaviors support the idea that dysregulation of the cholinergic system might contribute to the etiology of major depressive disorder. Thus, pharmacological agents that limit acetylcholine signaling through neuronal nAChRs might be promising for the development of novel antidepressant medications.",2010
Cerebrovascular damage in late-life depression is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of subcutaneous small arteries.,"Late-life depression is increasingly viewed as a vascular illness because of patients exhibiting characteristic white matter brain lesions and in vivo large artery endothelial dysfunction. However, the ""vascular depression"" hypothesis pertains to the microvasculature, and this circulation has not been studied in this context. Our objective was to examine structure and function of small subcutaneous arteries in patients with late-life depression. Thus, 16 patients aged 71.8±4.0 years with late-life depression were compared with 15 control participants aged 72.1±5.9 years. There were similar cardiovascular profiles between the 2 groups. All of the participants underwent MRI brain scans and subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy from which small arteries were isolated and studied using pressure myography. Cerebral microvascular damage in depressed patients was confirmed by assessment of basal ganglia Virchow-Robin space scores (depressed patients 3.9±1.7 versus controls: 2.5±1.6; P=0.01). Contractility to norepinephrine was equivalent in both groups, but relaxation of the small arteries to acetylcholine was significantly reduced in depressed patients (84.0±4.0%) compared with control participants (96.0±1.4%; P=0.012). This difference in arterial relaxation was reduced but not entirely eliminated when NO synthase was inhibited. Depressed patients also exhibited hypertrophic wall growth with an increase in medial cross-sectional area (P=0.035, multiple ANOVA and wall thickness; P=0.04, multiple ANOVA). In conclusion, despite similar cardiovascular profiles, depressed patients with cerebral microvascular damage show abnormalities of subcutaneous small artery structure and function.",2010
Pharmacologic approaches to treatment resistant depression: a re-examination for the modern era.,"Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is common and debilitating. Initial treatment is often insufficient to achieve full remission in a given depressive episode, resulting in more frequent episodes, worsened severity, and major disability. This review surveys literature on the diagnosis and pharmacological management of TRD in light of recent developments. Evidence regarding commonly used treatment options is critically examined and key recommendations are offered. The review ends by considering drugs acting on the melatonin, acetylcholine, and glutamate systems that hold promise as future options for TRD. Recent trends and research findings have impacted how the evidence supporting different approaches to TRD should be evaluated. For example, many earlier TRD studies employed tricyclics as the primary antidepressant, but tricyclics have now been superseded by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in routine clinical practice. This deficiency has been addressed by the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, the largest effectiveness study of TRD ever conducted. However, design characteristics of the STAR*D study preclude simple comparisons with earlier studies. A shortcoming of most treatment recommendations for TRD is their reliance on older studies that do not reflect the current preeminence of SSRIs in clinical practice. This has distorted the prioritization of pharmacological strategies for TRD. Efforts to correct this distortion with effectiveness research, designed to better reflect current practice trends, require critical consideration of the strengths and limitations of this approach.",2010
Muscarinic receptors in psychiatric disorders - can we mimic 'health'?,"The concept that acetylcholine is involved in the pathophysiologies of psychiatric disorders has existed since the 1950s. There is very strong evidence implicating a dysfunctional muscarinic system in schizophrenia, +with less information available for bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. The translation of this evidence into clinically viable treatments has been disappointing; hampered by problems associated with developing drugs that target the requisite members of the muscarinic family, rather than all of the receptors, which results in unacceptable side-effect profiles. The discovery of additional binding sites, other than the one occupied by acetylcholine, has revitalised research into this aspect of psychopharmacology. New compounds are now being developed that have the potential to selectively target individual muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system. The question that remains to be answered is whether stimulating central muscarinic receptors will result in the reestablishment of normal central muscarinic activity? The purpose of this review is to (i) summarise the data supporting a role of the muscarinic system in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, and (ii) give an overview of some of the new selective muscarinic ligands that are currently in development and try to address the issue of re-establishing appropriate central muscarinic function.",2009

Multivariate permutation analysis associates multiple polymorphisms with subphenotypes of major depression.,"Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent, disabling condition with multiple genetic and environmental factors impacting disease risk. The diagnosis of MDD relies on a cumulative measure derived from multiple trait dimensions and alone is limited in elucidating MDD genetic determinants. We and others have proposed that MDD may be better dissected using paradigms that assess how specific genes associate with component features of MDD. This within-disease design requires both a well-phenotyped cohort and a robust statistical approach that retains power with multiple tests of genetic association. In the present study, common polymorphic variants of genes related to central monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways that previous studies align with functional change in vitro or depression associations in vivo were genotyped in 110 individuals with unipolar MDD. Subphenotypic characteristics were examined using responses to individual items assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the NEO Five Factor Inventory. Multivariate Permutation Testing (MPT) was used to infer genotype-phenotype relationships underlying dimensional findings within clinical categories. MPT analyses show significant associations of the norepinephrine transporter (NET, SLC6A2) -182 T/C (rs2242446) with recurrent depression [odds ratio, OR = 4.15 (1.91-9.02)], NET -3081 A/T (rs28386840) with increase in appetite [OR = 3.58 (1.53-8.39)] and the presynaptic choline transporter (CHT, SLC5A7) Ile89Val (rs1013940) with HAM-D-17 total score {i.e. overall depression severity [OR = 2.74 (1.05-7.18)]}. These relationships illustrate an approach to the elucidation of gene influences on trait components of MDD and with replication, may help identify MDD subpopulations that can benefit from more targeted pharmacotherapy.",2008
Neurocognitive deficits in major depression and a new theory of ADHD: a model of impaired antagonism of cholinergic-mediated prepotent behaviours in monoamine depleted individuals.,"The study builds on the propositions introduced in a companion paper on the neuropharmacology of cognition and its relation to key findings in psychiatry. Cognitive inhibition is often invoked to explain performance in psychiatric illness. Yet it remains only a general conceptual model of executive dysfunction. Premotor theory proposes both neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological equivalents of conscious and unconscious processes. The interaction between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission is stated to have an inverse effect on these two fundamental psychological processes. If one conceives of cognitive inhibition as a failure to voluntarily suppress unconscious prepotent responses, then a deficit in monoaminergic antagonism of cholinergic facilitated prepotent responses accounts for the observed behavioural phenotypes. The plasticity of behaviour is further hypothesized to have an equivalent in intracellular signalling leading to plastic changes in neural networks. Apart from inhibition of prepotent responses it permits the formulation of new behavioural phenotypes. At the receptor level Gi-Gq/11 transduction coupling is proposed to mediate this effect. A hypofunctioning monoaminergic system is thought to underlie the clinical pictures of major depression and ADHD. The neurocognitive deficits of depression include memory loss, poor concentration and rumination. ADHD is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Both these syndromes effectively respond to raising serotonin and dopamine levels, respectively. The core symptoms can usefully be attributed to an imbalance between the neuromodulatory effects of monoamines and ACh. Taking the model of monoaminergic-muscarinic receptor interactions presented previously and extended here, a new hypothesis is proposed for the core symptoms of ADHD. Accordingly, impulsivity and hyperactivity result from impaired dopaminergic inhibition and remodelling of muscarinic mediated prepotent responses. The model also predicts memory impairment in major depression by proposing that low serotonin levels in the neocortex is linked to focal hippocampal dysfunction. Hippocampal theta is proposed to trigger phasic monoaminergic activation involved in encoding of cortical traces and plasticity of propotent networks. It proposes a hypothesis for the enhancement of mood and behaviour induced by antidepressants is partly a response to plasticity of neural networks, that is, remodelling of cholinergic-mediated negative habitual behaviours.",2007
Reduced muscarinic type 2 receptor binding in subjects with bipolar disorder.,"A variety of indirect evidence has implicated the central muscarinic-cholinergic system, and more specifically the type 2 muscarinic (M2) receptor, in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms arising in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. To assess the binding potential of muscarinic2 receptors in vivo during depression in subjects with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. The M2 receptor binding was compared between unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder during depression vs healthy controls, using positron emission tomography and [18F]FP-TZTP (fluorodopa F 18 [3-(3-[3-fluoroproply]thio)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridine), a selective M2 receptor radioligand. Outpatients at the National Institutes of Health. Unmedicated subjects with current depression meeting DSM-IV criteria for either major depressive disorder (n = 17) or bipolar disorder (n = 16) and 23 healthy control subjects. The primary outcome parameter was [(18)F]FP-TZTP distribution volume, which is proportional to the product of receptor density and affinity and, in the case of [(18)F]FP-TZTP, is known to be sensitive to endogenous acetylcholine concentrations. The relationship between illness severity, as rated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating scales, and distribution volume also was assessed. The mean anterior cingulate cortex distribution volume differed across groups (F55 = 3.4; P = .04), and this difference was accounted for by significantly lower binding in bipolar disorder compared with both major depressive disorder and control groups. The mean M2 receptor binding in subjects with bipolar disorder was reduced relative to both healthy controls and subjects with major depressive disorder, to an extent that correlated with depressive symptoms. The reduction in the bipolar disorder group could be accounted for either by a reduction in M2 receptor density or affinity or an elevation in endogenous acetylcholine levels. To our knowledge, these data provide the first direct evidence that altered M2 receptor function contributes to mood dysregulation in bipolar disorder.",2006
Physiologic mechanisms underlying the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.,"The rate at which serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment is terminated and the duration of treatment appear to be key factors in predicting discontinuation symptoms. The development of animal models to explain the mechanisms of this clinical problem has proved challenging, because less than half of all patients experience any discontinuation symptoms, many of which are subjective in nature. One explanation is that SRI discontinuation symptoms may arise from the rapid decrease in serotonin (5-HT) availability when treatment ends abruptly. Yet, it would appear that discontinuation discomforts may not be mediated exclusively through 5-HT receptors, given the major regulatory role 5-HT exerts on a number of specific chemical receptor systems in the brain. As a result, attempts to explain the determinants of this phenomenon rely on a certain level of speculation. This article examines the possible physiologic bases for the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome and briefly describes these adaptations. It discusses the 3 systems most likely to account for at least part of the symptomatology--the 5-HT, the norepinephrine, and the cholinergic systems--and the possible interactions among them. It also attempts to explain their implications in the therapeutic actions of antidepressants in patients with affective and anxiety disorders.",2006
Factors associated with complex visual hallucinations during antidepressant treatment.,"Published case reports on complex visual hallucinations (CVH) occurring during antidepressant (AD) treatment were reviewed. Thirteen cases of CVH associated with SSRI treatment, 16 cases during tricyclic drug treatment and seven cases with other AD drug treatments were found. Nine patients were taking concomitant drugs while on therapy with SSRIs and four had a neurological disease in addition to depression. The cholinergic impoverishment occurring in dementia states or during concomitant therapy with anticholinergic drugs could increase the sensitivity to serotonergic agonists, triggering the manifestation of CVH. During tricyclic drug treatment, half of the reports were of hypnopompic or hypnagogic hallucinations and this can be associated with the effects of tricyclics (TCA) on sleep architecture. It is likely that the potent anticholinergic effect of amitriptyline was potentiated in a situation of a rapidly changing state of consciousness. In general, the review supports the view that an imbalance between serotonin and acetylcholine systems is at the root of AD-induced CVH, with a profile defined by a cholinergic hypoactivity and a serotonergic hyperactivity. Caution is needed when administering a combination of serotonergic and anticholinergic AD in the treatment of the demented population and in other already compromised patients because there is a risk of precipitating CVH.",2004
Sleep-wake effects of yohimbine and atropine in rats with a clomipramine-based model of depression.,"The present study examined the sleep-wake cycle effects of microinjections of yohimbine, an adrenergic antagonist, and atropine, a cholinergic antagonist, into the cerebral ventricle of clomipramine-induced depressed rats. Yohimbine microinjection caused a significant reduction in the total duration and the number of REM sleep episodes compared to control saline injections. Atropine microinjection caused a significant reduction in the total duration and the number of REM sleep episodes without changing the REM sleep latency compared to control saline microinjection. These results show for the first time that the REM sleep disturbances observed in clomipramine-treatment induced depressed rats can be attenuated by increasing and decreasing the brain noradrenergic and cholinergic activities, respectively.",2002
Contribution of sleep physiology to depressive pathophysiology.,"Among the best characterized neurobiological changes in mood disorders are specific alterations in electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep, including disinhibited rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and suppressed slow wave sleep. A strong link between mood disorders and sleep is that depressive symptoms are alleviated by one night of sleep deprivation and reoccur after sleeping. Sleep underlies homeostatic and circadian mechanisms that interact in complex ways. These relationships have been formalized in electrophysiological, neurochemical and neuroendocrinological models that extend to the pathophysiology of affective illness. Sleep research as a pathophysiological window to the brain has contributed extensively to the understanding of the neurobiology of depression and has been a substantial guide for the advancement of model-driven clinical and preclinical research. Pharmacological probes of normal and depressed sleep play an important role. It is anticipated that the combination of novel topographical EEG and neuroimaging techniques with traditional experimental methods will provide us with further insight into the neurobiology of sleep and depression.",2001
Decreases in dilated pupil size in depressed patients with age may reflect adrenergic changes.,"Some studies have suggested that noradrenergic activity may decrease with age in depressed patients. Pupil size is regulated by a balance between norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The present study compares pupil size in 10 unmedicated patients with unipolar depression (296. 3) and in 16 normal controls. Pupil size after dilation with tropicamide, a cholinergic antagonist, was inversely related to age in the patients (r=-0.87), but did not diminish with age in controls. The results suggest that pupil size may provide an index of diminished noradrenergic function with age in patients with major depression.",2000
[Specifics of a dual action: toward new and more effective antidepressants?].,"Depression raises numerous questions that are pathophysiological, diagnostic and epidemiological as well as therapeutic. Amongst those questions, antidepressant drugs and their action mechanism(s) remain the subject of many studies in all fields, with a view to enhanced management of patients suffering from mood disorders. Numerous hypotheses both neurobiological and pharmacological have been advanced with respect to the neurochemical mechanisms involved in depressive disease and the neurobiological impact of antidepressants. In addition to the aminergic hypotheses which are currently the best supported, numerous arguments tend to show the value of taking into account the overall function of the brain and no longer only considering a single neuronal system. In this context, the value of a dual specific action on the main two central aminergic systems, the noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems, has now emerged.",1999
"A novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor induces antidepressant, pro-cognitive, and anti-anhedonic effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats: The role of the ghrelin-dopamine cascade.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often treatment resistant, particularly in addressing anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Novel pharmacological strategies are needed. While butyrylcholinesterase, ghrelin, and dopamine (DA) have been well studied in the context of stress and MDD, their interaction remains unclear. The dose-dependent antidepressant effects of a novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor (BChEI) were evaluated in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model of MDD. Behavioural assessments included the forced swim test (despair), sucrose preference test (reward-related), and novel object recognition test (cognition). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acetylcholine (ACh), and brain monoamines were analysed, as well as serum growth hormone and acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin. To confirm the role of ghrelin, pharmacological exploration was undertaken using the ghrelin receptor antagonist, D-Lys-3-GHRP-6. FSL rats had significantly lower ghrelin ratios, BDNF, ACh, DA and growth hormone levels. In FSL rats, both BChEI and escitalopram significantly reduced despair. BChEI significantly outperformed escitalopram in enhancing reward-related and cognitive behaviours. Biochemically, BChEI treatment significantly increased ghrelin ratios and brain DA levels without altering brain 5-HT, ACh or BDNF. D-Lys-3-GHRP-6 significantly reversed the antidepressant-like, rewarding, and pro-cognitive effects of BChEI, accompanied by significant reductions in BDNF and DA. FSL rats display impaired ghrelin, DA, serotonin, growth hormone, and BDNF signalling, akin to MDD. BChEI exerts antidepressant-like effects across despair, reward, and cognitive domains, most likely via the BChE-ghrelin-DA cascade. Reversal of these effects by ghrelin antagonism underscores the critical role of ghrelin, specifically via growth hormone secretagogue receptor-ghrelin interaction. These findings suggest a potentially novel multimodal neurobiological target for the treatment of MDD.",2025
Neural energy coding patterns of dopaminergic neural microcircuit and its impairment in major depressive disorder: A computational study.,"Numerous experiments have found that the behavioral characteristics of major depressive disorder (MDD) animals are usually associated with abnormal neural activity patterns and brain energy metabolism. However, the relationship among the behavioral characteristics, neural activity patterns and brain energy metabolism remains unknown. In this paper, we computationally investigated this relationship, with a particular focus on how neural energy coding patterns change in MDD brains, in the VTA-NAc-mPFC dopaminergic pathway of the reward system based on our biological neural network model and neural energy calculation model. Interestingly, our results suggested that the neural energy consumption of the whole VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit in MDD group was significantly reduced, which was mainly attributed to the decreasing neural energy consumption in the mPFC region. This observation theoretically supported the view of low-level energy consumption in MDD. We also investigated the neural energy consumption patterns of various neuronal types in our VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit under the influence of different dopamine concentrations, and found that there were some specific impairments in MDD, which provided some potential biomarkers for MDD diagnosis. More specifically, we found that the actual neural energy consumption of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc region was increased in the MDD group, whereas pyramidal neurons in the mPFC region exhibited higher actual neural energy consumption in the NC group. Additionally, in both neuron types, the actual neural energy required to generate an action potential was higher in the MDD group, suggesting that, given the same energy budget, these neurons in the MDD group tended to generate fewer action potentials. To further explore the relationship between neural coding patterns and neural energy coding patterns in the VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit, we in addition calculated P-V correlation for each neuronal type, defined as the Pearson's correlation coefficient between membrane potential and neural power. The results showed that the membrane potential and neural power were not perfectly correlated (P-V correlations ranged from 0.6 to 0.9), and dopamine concentration inputs affected the P-V correlations of the MSN, pyramidal neurons and CB interneurons in the mPFC region. These findings suggested that the joint application of the neural coding theory and neural energy coding theory will be superior to the application of any single theory, and this joint application could help discover new mechanisms in neurocircuits of MDD. Overall, our study not only uncovered the neural energy coding patterns for the VTA-NAc-mPFC neural microcircuit, but also presented a novel pipeline for the study of MDD based on the neural coding theory and neural energy coding theory.",2025
Dopaminergic changes in the subgenual cingulate cortex in dementia with lewy bodies associates with presence of depression.,"In addition to the core clinical features of fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism, individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) frequently experience chronic and debilitating major depression. Treatment of depression in DLB is hampered by a lack of available effective therapies and standard serotonergic medication for major depressive disorder (MDD) is typically ineffective. Dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission contributing to anhedonia and loss of motivation has been described in MDD. The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) is important in mood regulation and in the symptomatic expression of depression, displaying structural, functional and metabolic abnormalities in MDD. To assess dopaminergic and serotonergic synaptic changes in DLB, post mortem sgACC tissue from DLB donors with and without depression was investigated using high-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, as well as Western and dot blotting techniques. STED imaging demonstrated the presence of α-synuclein within individual dopaminergic terminals in the sgACC, α-synuclein presence showing a significant positive correlation with increased synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP25) volumes in depressed DLB cases. A reduction in dopaminergic innervation in the sgACC was observed in DLB cases with depression compared to controls (p < 0.001), but not in non-depressed DLB donors, along with reduced levels of multiple dopaminergic markers and receptors. Limited alterations were observed in serotonergic markers. Our work demonstrates a role for dopaminergic neurotransmission in the aetiology of depression in DLB. Careful and selective targeting of dopaminergic systems in the sgACC may be a therapeutic option for treatment of depression in DLB.",2025
"Gestational stress disrupts dopamine and oxytocin signaling in the postpartum reward system of rats: implications for mood, motivation and mothering.","Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to 20% of new mothers and has adverse consequences for the well-being of both mother and child. Exposure to stress during pregnancy as well as dysregulation in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) reward system and its upstream modulator oxytocin (OT) have been independently linked to PPD. However, no studies have directly examined DA or OT signaling in the postpartum brain after gestational stress. Here we employed a chronic variable stress procedure during pregnancy and evaluated behavioral measures of mood and reward along with assessments of DA and OT signaling in postpartum rats. Our results show that gestational stress induced postpartum depressive-like and anxiety-like behavior in addition to producing reward-related deficits including anhedonia, impaired maternal care, and reduced maternal motivation. Consistent with a hypodopaminergic state, histological analysis revealed reduced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the NAc shell and core as well as reduced expression of the dopamine transporter and dopamine D2 receptor in the NAc shell of postpartum females exposed to gestational stress. A reduction in accumbal DA content as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was also observed in gestationally-stressed dams. Lastly, we assessed mRNA expression of OT and OT receptors (OTR) and found that gestational stress increased OT expression in the hypothalamus but reduced OTR expression in the postpartum ventral tegmental area (VTA), a target of hypothalamic OT neurons. In the VTA, a reduction in OT-immunoreactive fibers following gestational stress was also seen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the DA and OT systems within the postpartum reward circuit are sensitive to gestational stress and suggest that mood and maternal disruptions in PPD may arise from dysfunctional oxytocinergic regulation of the dopaminergic reward system.",2025
Structural connectivity of dopaminergic pathways in major depressive disorder: An ultra-high resolution 7-Tesla diffusion MRI study.,"Accumulating evidence points to imbalanced dopamine (DA) signaling and circulating levels in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the use of conventional MRI scanners and acquisition techniques has prevented a thorough examination of DA neural pathways in MDD. We uniquely employed ultra-high field diffusion MRI at 7.0 Tesla to map the white matter architecture and integrity of several DA pathways in MDD patients. Fifty-three MDD patients and 12 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the final analysis. Images were acquired using a 7.0 Tesla MRI scanner. FreeSurfer was used to segment components of DA pathways, and MRtrix was used to perform preprocessing and tractography of mesolimbic, mesocortical, nigrostriatal, and unconventional DA pathways. Bayesian analyses assessed the impact of MDD and clinical features on DA tracts. MDD was associated with perturbed white matter microstructural properties of the nigrostriatal pathway, while several MDD features (severity of depression/age of onset/insomnia) related to connectivity changes within mesocortical, nigrostriatal, and unconventional pathways. MDD is associated with microstructural differences in the nigrostriatal pathway. The findings provide insight into the structural architecture and integrity of several DA pathways in MDD, and implicate their involvement in the clinical manifestation of MDD.",2024
Novel multi-modal methodology to investigate placebo response in major depressive disorder.,"The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the placebo phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain largely unknown. The progressive rise in rates of placebo responses within clinical trials over the past two decades may impede the detection of a true signal and thus present a major obstacle in new treatment development. Understanding the mechanisms would have several important implications, including (1) identifying biomarkers of placebo responders (thereby identifying those individuals who could benefit therapeutically from such interventions), (2) opening new avenues for manipulating such mechanisms to maximize symptom reduction, and (3) refining treatments with approaches that decrease (in clinical trials) or increase (in clinical practice) the placebo response. Here we investigated the research question: is the dopaminergic system one of the neurobiological underpinnings of the placebo response within MDD? Inspired by preclinical and clinical findings that have implicated dopamine in the occurrence, prediction, and expectation of reward, we hypothesized that dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic system is a critical mediator of placebo response in MDD. To test this hypothesis, we designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design clinical trial aimed at maximizing placebo antidepressant response. We integrated behavioral, imaging, and hemodynamic probes of mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways within the context of manipulations of psychological constructs previously linked to placebo responses (e.g., expectation of improvement). The aim of this manuscript is to present the rationale of the study design and to demonstrate how a cross-modal methodology may be utilized to investigate the role of reward circuitry in placebo response in MDD.",2025
Effect of esketamine on serum neurotransmitters in patients with postpartum depression: a randomized controlled trial.,"The development of postpartum depression has been linked to fluctuations in the levels of neurotransmitters in the human body, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (Norepinephrine, NE), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research has indicated that the antidepressant effect of esketamine are mediated by monoamine transmitters and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we postulate that intravenous administration of esketamine in patients with postpartum depression may alter the serum concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Three hundred fifteen patients with postpartum depression were selected and divided into two groups based on randomized numerical expression: esketamine (E) group (0. 25 mg/kg esketamine) and control (C) group (a same volume of 0.9% saline), all the drugs were pumped for 40 min. After the end of drug pumping, all patients were continuously observed for 2 h. Changes in serum levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, BDNF were recorded before drug administration and on the 3rd day after drug administration. The scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were calculated before drug administration, and on the 3rd day and on the 30th day after drug administration. Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and feeling of detachment occurred were recorded within 2 h after drug administration. Before drug administration, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (0. 91 ± 0. 19 vs. 0. 98 ± 0. 21, P = 0. 181), (2. 38 ± 0. 35 vs. 2. 32 ± 0. 32, P = 0. 491), (3. 07 ± 0. 89 vs 3. 02 ± 0. 88, P = 0. 828), (39. 79 ± 7. 78 vs 41. 34 ± 10. 03, P = 0. 506). On the third day post-medication, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (1. 42 ± 0. 35 vs. 0. 96 ± 0. 24, P < 0. 001), (3. 99 ± 0. 17 vs. 2. 41 ± 0. 28, P < 0. 001),(5. 45 ± 0. 81 vs 3. 22 ± 0. 76, P < 0. 001),(44. 36 ± 9. 98 vs 40. 69 ± 11. 75, P = 0. 198). Before medication, the EPDS scores were (16. 15 ± 3. 02 vs 17. 85 ± 3. 89, P = 0. 064). on the third day after medication, the Group E had significantly reduced scores (12. 98 ± 2. 39 vs 16. 73 ± 3. 52, P < 0. 001). On the 30rd day after medication, EPDS scores between the two groups were (16. 34 ± 3. 43 vs 16. 91 ± 4. 02, p = 0. 203). Within 2 h of medication, the rate of adverse events was similar between the two groups. Small doses of esketamine can increase the serum concentration of 5-HT,DA,BDNF, and in the short term, decrease EPDS scores, and improve postpartum depressive symptoms. Retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300078343, 2023/12/05).",2024
From movement to motivation: a proposed framework to understand the antidepressant effect of exercise.,"Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, exerting a profound negative impact on quality of life in those who experience it. Depression is associated with disruptions to several closely related neural and cognitive processes, including dopamine transmission, fronto-striatal brain activity and connectivity, reward processing and motivation. Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, reduces depressive symptoms, but the mechanisms driving its antidepressant effects are poorly understood. Here we propose a novel hypothesis for understanding the antidepressant effects of exercise, centred on motivation, across different levels of explanation. There is robust evidence that aerobic exercise decreases systemic inflammation. Inflammation is known to reduce dopamine transmission, which in turn is strongly implicated in effort-based decision making for reward. Drawing on a broad range of research in humans and animals, we propose that by reducing inflammation and boosting dopamine transmission, with consequent effects on effort-based decision making for reward, exercise initially specifically improves 'interest-activity' symptoms of depression-namely anhedonia, fatigue and subjective cognitive impairment - by increasing propensity to exert effort. Extending this framework to the topic of cognitive control, we explain how cognitive impairment in depression may also be conceptualised through an effort-based decision-making framework, which may help to explain the impact of exercise on cognitive impairment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of exercise could inform the development of novel intervention strategies, in particular personalised interventions and boost social prescribing.",2024
Dopaminergic dysfunction in the left putamen of patients with major depressive disorder.,"Dopaminergic transmission impairment has been identified as one of the main neurobiological correlates of both depression and clinical symptoms commonly associated with its spectrum such as anhedonia and psychomotor retardation. We examined the relationship between dopaminergic deficit in the striatum, as measured by <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging, and specific psychopathological dimensions in patients with major depressive disorder. To our knowledge this is the first study with a sample of >120 subjects. After check for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 121 (67 females, 54 males) patients were chosen retrospectively from an extensive 1106 patients database of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT scans obtained at the Nuclear Medicine Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. These individuals had undergone striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) assessments based on the recommendation of their referring clinicians, who were either neurologists or psychiatrists. At the time of SPECT imaging, each participant underwent psychiatric and psychometric evaluations. We used the following psychometric scales: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and Depression Retardation Rating Scale. We found a negative correlation between levels of depression (p = 0.007), anxiety (p = 0.035), anhedonia (p = 0.028) and psychomotor retardation (p = 0.014) and DAT availability in the left putamen. We further stratified the sample and found that DAT availability in the left putamen was lower in seriously depressed patients (p = 0.027) and in patients with significant psychomotor retardation (p = 0.048). To our knowledge this is the first study to have such a high number of sample. Our study reveals a pivotal role of dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with major depressive disorder. Elevated levels of depression, anxiety, anhedonia, and psychomotor retardation appear to be associated with reduced DAT availability specifically in the left putamen.",2024
The Formation and Function of the VTA Dopamine System.,"The midbrain dopamine system is a sophisticated hub that integrates diverse inputs to control multiple physiological functions, including locomotion, motivation, cognition, reward, as well as maternal and reproductive behaviors. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that binds to G-protein-coupled receptors. Dopamine also works together with other neurotransmitters and various neuropeptides to maintain the balance of synaptic functions. The dysfunction of the dopamine system leads to several conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, major depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been identified as an important relay nucleus that modulates homeostatic plasticity in the midbrain dopamine system. Due to the complexity of synaptic transmissions and input-output connections in the VTA, the structure and function of this crucial brain region are still not fully understood. In this review article, we mainly focus on the cell types, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, ion channels, receptors, and neural circuits of the VTA dopamine system, with the hope of obtaining new insight into the formation and function of this vital brain region.",2024
Affective disorders and the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential: Serotonin and beyond.,"Identifying additional noninvasive biomarkers for affective disorders, such as unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), could aid in the diagnosis and treatment of these prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric conditions. One such candidate biomarker is the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), an event-related potential that measures responsiveness of the auditory cortex to different intensities of sound. The LDAEP has been associated with MDD and BD, including therapeutic response to particular classes of antidepressant drugs, while also correlating with several other neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been suggested that increased values of the LDAEP indicate low central serotonergic neurotransmission, further implicating this EEG measure in depression. Here, we briefly review the literature on the LDAEP in affective disorders, including its association with serotonergic signaling, as well as with that of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine. We summarize key findings on the LDAEP and the genetics of these neurotransmitters, as well as prediction of response to particular classes of antidepressants in MDD, including SSRIs versus noradrenergic agents. The possible relationship between this EEG measure and suicidality is addressed. We also briefly analyze acute pharmacologic studies of serotonin and/or dopamine precursor depletion and the LDAEP. In conclusion, the existing literature suggests that serotonin and norepinephrine may modulate the LDAEP in an opposing manner, and that this event-related marker may be of use in predicting response to chronic treatment with particular pharmacologic agents in the context of affective disorders, such as MDD and BD, including in the presence of suicidality.",2024
Genetically encoded sensors for in vivo detection of neurochemicals relevant to depression.,"Depressive disorders are a common and debilitating form of mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying causes and mechanisms of depressive disorders are still poorly understood. Neurochemical systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, have been implicated in the development and perpetuation of depressive symptoms. Current treatments for depression target these neuromodulator systems, but there is a need for a better understanding of their role in order to develop more effective treatments. Monitoring neurochemical dynamics during depressive symptoms is crucial for gaining a better a understanding of their involvement in depressive disorders. Genetically encoded sensors have emerged recently that offer high spatial-temporal resolution and the ability to monitor neurochemical dynamics in real time. This review explores the neurochemical systems involved in depression and discusses the applications and limitations of current monitoring tools for neurochemical dynamics. It also highlights the potential of genetically encoded sensors for better characterizing neurochemical dynamics in depression-related behaviors. Furthermore, potential improvements to current sensors are discussed in order to meet the requirements of depression research.",2024

NAc-DBS corrects depression-like behaviors in CUMS mouse model via disinhibition of DA neurons in the VTA.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include loss of motivation and anhedonia. If multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy fail in some patients with MDD, their condition is then termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MDD can be associated with abnormalities in the reward-system-dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, in which the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) play major roles. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the NAc alleviates the depressive symptoms of MDD. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of this DBS has remained elusive. In this study, using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we investigated the behavioral and neurobiological effects of NAc-DBS on the multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by CUMS by integrating behavioral, in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), calcium imaging, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation methods in freely moving mice. We found that long-term and repeated, but not single, NAc-DBS induced robust antidepressant responses in CUMS mice. Moreover, even a single trial NAc-DBS led to the elevation of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, accompanied by the increase in dopamine (DA) neuron activity in the VTA. Both the inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity and knockdown of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α1 gene in VTA-GABA neurons blocked the antidepressant effect of NAc-DBS in CUMS mice. Our results showed that NAc-DBS could disinhibit VTA-DA neurons by regulating the level of GABA and the activity of VTA-GABA in the VTA and could finally correct the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mouse model.",2024
Quantification of Plasma Dopamine in Depressed Patients Using Silver-Enriched Silicon Nanowires as SERS-Active Substrates.,"A decrease in the levels of dopamine (DA)─a key catecholamine biomarker for major depressive disorder─highlights the need for quantitative analysis of biological fluids to aid in the early diagnosis of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. This study developed silicon nanowires enriched with silver nanoparticles to serve as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate to enable precise and sensitive quantification of blood plasma DA levels in humans. The silver-enriched silicon nanowires (SiNWs@Ag) yielded flower-like assemblies with densely populated SERS ""hot spots,"" allowing sensitive DA detection. By correlating DA concentration with Raman intensity at 1156 cm<sup>-1</sup>, the plasma DA levels in treatment-naïve patients with major depression (<i>n</i> = 18) were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 18) (6.56 × 10<sup>-10</sup> M vs 1.43 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M). The plasma DA concentrations differed significantly between the two groups (two-tailed <i>p</i> = 5.77×10<sup>-7</sup>), highlighting a distinct demarcation between depression patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, the SiNWs@Ag substrate effectively differentiated between DA and norepinephrine (NE) in mixtures at nanomolar levels, demonstrating its selective detection capability. This study represents the first report on the quantitative detection of DA levels in human blood samples from individuals with major depression using an SERS technique, emphasizing its potential clinical utility in the evaluation and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders.",2024
"Dysfunction of neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the severity of depression in first-diagnosed, drug-naïve depressed patients.","Biochemical changes of neurotransmitters underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) are unknown. This study preliminarily explored the association between neurotransmitters with MDD and the possibility of objective laboratory prediction of neurotransmitter involvement in MDD. A total of 87 first-diagnosed, drug-naïve patients with depression and 50 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the cross-sectional study. The levels and turnovers of neurotransmitters (glutamine (GLN), glutamic acid (GLU), γ-2Aminobutiric acid (GABA), kainate (KA), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), 3-methoxy 4-hydroxyphenyl ethylene glycol (MHPG), noradrenaline (NE), homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), dopamine (DA), tryptophane (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) were determined and the confounding factors were adjusted. Then a correlation and a predictive analysis towards neurotransmitters for MDD were performed. After adjusting confounding factors, GLU (OR = 1.159), (GLU+ GABA)/GLN (OR = 1.217), DOPAC (OR = 1.106), DOPAC/DA (OR = 1.089) and (DOPAC+ HVA)/DA (OR = 1.026) enacted as risk factors of MDD, while KYN (OR = 0.992) was a protective factor. GABAergic and TRPergic pathways were associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with depression. The predictive model for MDD (AUC = 0.775, 95%CI 0.683-0.860) consisted of KYN (OR = 0.990) and (GLU + GABA)/GLN (OR = 4.101). First-diagnosed, drug-naïve depression patients showed abnormal neurotransmitter composition. GLU, (GLU + GABA)/GLN, DOPAC, DOPAC/DA and (DOPAC + HVA)/DA were risk factors of MDD, while KYN was a protective factor. GABAergic and TRPergic pathways were correlated with MDD clinical characteristics. KYN and (GLU + GABA)/GLN may have a predictive value for MDD.",2024
Ventral tegmental area dopaminergic circuits participates in stress-induced chronic postsurgical pain in male mice.,"Chronic postsurgical pain (CPP) markedly impairs patients' quality of life. Research has shown that chronic stress may extend incisional nociception in male mice. Dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are integral to stress-related mental disorders (including major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and PTSD) and pain. However, the impact of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission in the development of CPP is yet to be established. It remains uncertain whether the dopamine signals in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), which regulate pain, derive from the VTA. This study aims to explore the role of VTA-rACC dopaminergic circuits in a mouse model of CPP induced by CSDS. We conducted CSDS on C57BL/6 J wild-type male mice (n = 12-16 mice/group) and DAT-cre male mice (n = 10-12 mice/group). After 10 days of CSDS, a left posterior plantar incision was made to establish a mouse model of CPP. Paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) were evaluated using Von-Frey fibre stimulation. The open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPM) were used to assess pain-related negative emotions. We used immunofluorescence staining and Western Blot to analyse D1, D2, c-Fos, and TH expression. DAergic fibre projections in the VTA-rACC neural pathway were traced using retrograde tracing and immunofluorescence staining. Optogenetics and Chemogenetics were employed to manipulate DAergic neurons in the VTA and their axons in the rACC. The ipsilateral PWTs in male C57BL/6 J mice significantly decreased after surgery, returning to baseline after seven days. Conversely, in CSDS mice, ipsilateral PWTs remained reduced for at least 30 days post-incision. A significant reduction in TH-positive neurons expressing c-Fos in the VTA of CPP mice was observed 15 days post-incision. Activating DAergic neurons significantly improved ipsilateral PWTs and locomotor performance in the OFT and EPM in CPP mice post-incision. Additionally, D1 expression in the rACC was found to decrease in CPP mice, and this reduction counteracted the increase in PWTs caused by activating DAergic neuron axon terminals in the rACC. CSDS results in chronicity of postsurgical nociception and anxiety-like negative emotions, with alterations in DA transmission playing a role in CPP. Specific activation of DAergic neurons mitigates nociceptive responses and anxiety-like bahaviors, possibly mediated by D1 receptors in the rACC.",2024
Dopamine in major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo imaging studies.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability. Several lines of evidence implicate the dopamine system in its pathophysiology. However, the magnitude and consistency of the findings are unknown. We address this by systematically reviewing in vivo imaging evidence for dopamine measures in MDD and meta-analysing these where there are sufficient studies. Studies investigating the dopaminergic system using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography in MDD and a control group were included. Demographic, clinical and imaging measures were extracted from each study, and meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. We identified 43 studies including 662 patients and 801 controls. Meta-analysis of 38 studies showed no difference in mean or mean variability of striatal D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability (<i>g</i> = 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.620), or combined dopamine synthesis and release capacity (<i>g</i> = 0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.309). Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was lower in the MDD group in studies using DAT selective tracers (<i>g</i> = -0.56, <i>p</i> = 0.006), but not when tracers with an affinity for serotonin transporters were included (<i>g</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.420). Subgroup analysis showed greater dopamine release (<i>g</i> = 0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.030), but no difference in dopamine synthesis capacity (<i>g</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.434) in the MDD group. Striatal D<sub>1</sub> receptor availability was lower in patients with MDD in two studies. The meta-analysis indicates striatal DAT availability is lower, but D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability is not altered in people with MDD compared to healthy controls. There may be greater dopamine release and lower striatal D<sub>1</sub> receptors in MDD, although further studies are warranted. We discuss factors associated with these findings, discrepancies with preclinical literature and implications for future research.",2023
Neural energy computations based on Hodgkin-Huxley models bridge abnormal neuronal activities and energy consumption patterns of major depressive disorder.,"Limited by the current experimental techniques and neurodynamical models, the dysregulation mechanisms of decision-making related neural circuits in major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not clear. In this paper, we proposed a neural coding methodology using energy to further investigate it, which has been proven to strongly complement the neurodynamical methodology. We augmented the previous neural energy calculation method, and applied it to our VTA-NAc-mPFC neurodynamical H-H models. We particularly focused on the peak power and energy consumption of abnormal ion channel (ionic) currents under different concentrations of dopamine input, and investigated the abnormal energy consumption patterns for the MDD group. The results revealed that the energy consumption of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc region were lower in the MDD group than that of the normal control group despite having the same firing frequencies, peak action potentials, and average membrane potentials in both groups. Dopamine concentration was also positively correlated with the energy consumption of the pyramidal neurons, but the patterns of different interneuron types were distinct. Additionally, the ratio of mPFC's energy consumption to total energy consumption of the whole network in MDD group was lower than that in normal control group, revealing that the mPFC region in MDD group encoded less neural information, which matched the energy consumption patterns of BOLD-fMRI results. It was also in line with the behavioral characteristics that MDD patients demonstrated in the form of reward insensitivity during decision-making tasks. In conclusion, the model in this paper was the first neural network energy computational model for MDD, which showed success in explaining its dynamical mechanisms with an energy consumption perspective. To build on this, we demonstrated that energy consumption levels can be used as a potential indicator for MDD, which also showed a promising pipeline to use an energy methodology for studying other neuropsychiatric disorders.",2023
D1R-5-HT2AR Uncoupling Reduces Depressive Behaviours via HDAC Signalling.,"Dopamine and serotonin signalling are associated with major depressive disorder, which is a prevalent life-threatening illness worldwide. Numerous FDA-approved dopamine/serotonin signalling-modifying drugs are available but are associated with concurrent side effects and limited efficacy. Thus, identifying and targeting their signalling pathway is crucial for improving depression treatment. Here, we determined that serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT2AR) abundantly forms a protein complex with dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) in high abundance via its carboxy-terminus in the brains of mice subjected to various chronic stress paradigms. Furthermore, the D1R/5-HT2AR interaction elicited CREB/ERK/AKT modulation during synaptic regulation. An interfering peptide (TAT-5-HT2AR-SV) agitated the D1R/5-HT2AR interaction and attenuated depressive symptoms accompanied by CREB/ERK molecule costimulation. Interestingly, HDAC antagonism but not TrkB antagonism reversed the antidepressant effect of competitive peptides. These findings revealed a novel D1R/5-HT2AR heteroreceptor complex mechanism in the pathophysiology of depression, and their uncoupling ameliorates depressive-like behaviours through HDAC-, and not BDNF-, dependent mechanisms.",2023
Evaluating lumateperone for its use in treating depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder in adults.,"Lumateperone is a novel antipsychotic medication that has recently received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of major depressive episodes of type I and II bipolar disorder. It is approved for use as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproic acid. Clinical trials performed with lumateperone for bipolar disorder were reviewed. Additionally, pharmacodynamic actions of lumateperone are reviewed. Lumateperone is superior to placebo whether used alone or in combination with a mood stabilizer in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder. It achieves this effect with minimal dopamine blockade-related side effects due to less than 50% dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. While the pharmacodynamic profile of lumateperone is unique, the mechanism of action in bipolar depression remains obscure. Lumateperone is an antipsychotic with full antagonist effects at the post-synaptic D2, and partial agonist effects at the presynaptic D2. This unique profile allows for both antipsychotic and antidepressant effects at the same dose, which does not produce dopamine-related side effects. Consequently, lumateperone is exceptionally well tolerated compared to other antidepressant-acting antipsychotic agents. It is now the only agent approved as an adjunct to the mood stabilizer for bipolar II depression.",2023
Striatal dopamine in anhedonia: A simultaneous [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation.,"Anhedonia is hypothesized to be associated with blunted mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) functioning in samples with major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine linkages between striatal DA, reward circuitry functioning, anhedonia, and, in an exploratory fashion, self-reported stress, in a transdiagnostic anhedonic sample. Participants with (n = 25) and without (n = 12) clinically impairing anhedonia completed a reward-processing task during simultaneous positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance (PET-MR) imaging with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, a DA D2/D3 receptor antagonist that selectively binds to striatal DA receptors. Relative to controls, the anhedonia group exhibited decreased task-related DA release in the left putamen, caudate, and nucleus accumbens and right putamen and pallidum. There were no group differences in task-related brain activation (fMRI) during reward processing after correcting for multiple comparisons. General functional connectivity (GFC) findings revealed blunted fMRI connectivity between PET-derived striatal seeds and target regions in the anhedonia group. Associations were identified between anhedonia severity and the magnitude of task-related DA release to rewards in the left putamen, but not mesocorticolimbic GFC. Results provide evidence for reduced striatal DA functioning during reward processing and blunted mesocorticolimbic network functional connectivity in a transdiagnostic sample with clinically significant anhedonia.",2023
"Towards a multilevel model of major depression: genes, immuno-metabolic function, and cortico-striatal signaling.","Biological assay and imaging techniques have made visible a great deal of the machinery of mental illness. Over fifty years of investigation of mood disorders using these technologies has identified several biological regularities in these disorders. Here we present a narrative connecting genetic, cytokine, neurotransmitter, and neural-systems-level findings in major depressive disorder (MDD). Specifically, we connect recent genome-wide findings in MDD to metabolic and immunological disturbance in this disorder and then detail links between immunological abnormalities and dopaminergic signaling within cortico-striatal circuitry. Following this, we discuss implications of reduced dopaminergic tone for cortico-striatal signal conduction in MDD. Finally, we specify some of the flaws in the current model and propose ways forward for advancing multilevel formulations of MDD most efficiently.",2023
Impact of insulin and insulin resistance on brain dopamine signalling and reward processing - An underexplored mechanism in the pathophysiology of depression?,"Type 2 diabetes and major depressive disorder (MDD) are the leading causes of disability worldwide and have a high comorbidity rate with fatal outcomes. Despite the long-established association between these conditions, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Since the discovery of insulin receptors in the brain and the brain's reward system, evidence has accumulated indicating that insulin modulates dopaminergic (DA) signalling and reward behaviour. Here, we review the evidence from rodent and human studies, that insulin resistance directly alters central DA pathways, which may result in motivational deficits and depressive symptoms. Specifically, we first elaborate on the differential effects of insulin on DA signalling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) - the primary DA source region in the midbrain - and the striatum as well as its effects on behaviour. We then focus on the alterations induced by insulin deficiency and resistance. Finally, we review the impact of insulin resistance in DA pathways in promoting depressive symptoms and anhedonia on a molecular and epidemiological level and discuss its relevance for stratified treatment strategies.",2023
Distinctive alterations in the mesocorticolimbic circuits in various psychiatric disorders.,"Increasing evidence suggests that psychiatric disorders are linked to alterations in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related circuits. However, the common and disease-specific alterations remain to be examined in schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thus, this study aimed to examine common and disease-specific features related to mesocorticolimbic circuits. This study included 555 participants from four institutes with five scanners: 140 individuals with SCZ (45.0% female), 127 individuals with MDD (44.9%), 119 individuals with ASD (15.1%), and 169 healthy controls (HC) (34.9%). All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A parametric empirical Bayes approach was adopted to compare estimated effective connectivity among groups. Intrinsic effective connectivity focusing on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related circuits including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), shell and core parts of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were examined using a dynamic causal modeling analysis across these psychiatric disorders. The excitatory shell-to-core connectivity was greater in all patients than in the HC group. The inhibitory shell-to-VTA and shell-to-mPFC connectivities were greater in the ASD group than in the HC, MDD, and SCZ groups. Furthermore, the VTA-to-core and VTA-to-shell connectivities were excitatory in the ASD group, while those connections were inhibitory in the HC, MDD, and SCZ groups. Impaired signaling in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related circuits could be an underlying neuropathogenesis of various psychiatric disorders. These findings will improve the understanding of unique neural alternations of each disorder and will facilitate identification of effective therapeutic targets.",2023
"Plasma neuropeptide levels in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder and healthy controls: A multiplex immunoassay study.","We aimed to compare neuropeptide levels between patients with major psychiatric disorders and healthy controls and examine their association with symptoms and cognitive function. The participants were 149 patients with schizophrenia, 115 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 186 unremitted patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 350 healthy controls. Psychiatric (schizophrenic, manic, and depressive) symptoms, sleep state, and cognitive (premorbid intelligence quotient, general cognitive, and memory) functions were evaluated. A multiplex immunoassay kit was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels. The verification assay revealed that CSF α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were too low to be reliably measured, while plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels could be successfully measured. Plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and healthy controls. Plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and cognitive function scores in patients or healthy controls. Our data suggest that plasma neuropeptide levels do not elucidate the involvement of neuropeptides in the pathology of schizophrenia, BD, or MDD.",2023
Examination of pain threshold and neuropeptides in patients with acute suicide risk.,"One of the main challenges in suicide prevention is the limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying suicide. Recent findings suggest impairments in pain processing in acutely suicidal patients. However, little is known about the biological factors that may drive these discrete physiological abnormalities. In this study, we examined plasma peptides involved in analgesic and inflammatory responses and physical pain threshold in acutely suicidal patients. Thirty-seven depressed patients of both sexes hospitalized for severe suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt were characterized clinically including history of suicidal ideation and behavior. Psychological and physical pain, and pressure pain threshold was also measured. Plasma levels of β-endorphin, neurotensin, agouti-related protein (AgRP), C-reactive protein (CRP), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were run in Milliplex multiplex assays. The number of lifetime suicide attempts was positively correlated with β-endorphin (r = 0.702; p = 0.007), and neurotensin (r = 0.728, p = 0.007) plasma levels. Higher pain threshold was measured in the suicide attempt group as compared to the suicidal ideation group. Pain threshold was strongly and negatively associated with CRP plasma levels (r = -0.548; p < 0.001). In patients reporting chronic pain, lower AgRP levels and lower pain threshold were observed (t = 4.472; p = 0.001). Our results suggest that abnormalities in the opioid and neurotensin systems may underlie the increase in pain threshold found in suicide attempters, and possibly risk for suicidal behavior. Targeting pain circuits and systems may provide therapeutic mechanisms for suicide prevention.",2019
IL-10 is associated with increased mu-opioid receptor levels in major depressive disorder.,"Activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) and the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) and aberrations in endogenous opioids play a role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). There are no studies which examined the associations between both systems in MDD. The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between β-Endorphin (β-EP), Endomorphin-2, and their mu-opioid receptor (MOR) as well as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in MDD patients. The study included 60 depressed drug-free male patients and 30 matched controls. Serum β-EP, Endomorphin-2, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were measured using ELISA techniques. The results revealed a significant increase in serum β-EP, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 in MDD patients versus healthy controls. MOR levels were strongly associated with IL-10 levels. There were no significant correlations between endogenous opioids and IL-6 and IL-10. The results show that MOR levels may function as a possible component of the CIRS whilst there is no evidence that β-EP and EM-2 may modify the IRS. The significant correlation between MOR levels and IL-10 may be explained through central activation of the HPA-axis and increased B-cell numbers expressing MOR as a response to cytokine over-secretion in MDD.",2019
Predictors of Postpartum Depression: A Comprehensive Review of the Last Decade of Evidence.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most frequent complications of childbirth affecting ~500,000 women annually (prevalence 10% to 15%). Despite the documented adverse outcomes for mother and child, there remains a great need to develop prospective approaches to identify women at risk. This review examines some of the best-characterized molecular and clinical risk factors for PPD. We illustrate that this is a growing literature but there remains a lack of reliable molecular predictors for PPD. Current best predictors are clinical assessments for psychiatric history and adverse life events, highlighting the need for increased depression screening across the perinatal period.",2018
Increased β-endorphin level in blood plasma as an indicator of positive response to depression treatment.,Preliminary data indicate that increased blood plasma level of β-endorphin in patients with nonpsychotic unipolar depression after 2 weeks of treatment correlates with the positive response to therapy. This parameter can be regarded as an objective indicator of potential improvements. Further studies aimed at determining the value of blood β-endorphin levels in patients with mood disorders for the diagnostics and estimating the therapeutic success in this disease are required.,2012
Histories of major depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder: Evidence for phenotypic differences.,"This study examined unique versus shared stress and pain-related phenotypes associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and prior major depressive disorder (MDD). Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis measures were assessed at rest and during mental stress, as well as sensitivity to cold pressor and tourniquet ischemic pain tasks in four groups of women: (1) non-PMDD with no prior MDD (N=18); (2) non-PMDD with prior MDD (N=9); (3) PMDD with no prior MDD (N=17); (4) PMDD with prior MDD (N=10). PMDD women showed blunted SNS responses to stress compared to non-PMDD women, irrespective of prior MDD; while women with prior MDD showed exaggerated diastolic blood pressure responses to stress versus never depressed women, irrespective of PMDD. However, only in women with histories of MDD did PMDD women have lower cortisol concentrations than non-PMDD women, and only in non-PMDD women was MDD associated with reduced cold pressor pain sensitivity. These results suggest both unique phenotypic differences between women with PMDD and those with a history of MDD, but also indicate that histories of MDD may have special relevance for PMDD.",2010
Prenatal beta-endorphin as an early predictor of postpartum depressive symptoms in euthymic women.,"After delivery, many women experience symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), and early identification of women at risk is therefore important. The opioid peptide beta-endorphin has been implicated in non-puerperal depression but its role in the development of PPD is unknown. Three hundred and seven women with a singleton, full-term (>37.0 weeks' GA) pregnancy were recruited early in pregnancy and followed up into the postpartum period. Blood samples were obtained at 15, 19, 25, 31 and 37 weeks' gestational age (GA) and at 9 weeks postpartum for assessment of beta-endorphin. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale at the last four pregnancy visits and with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale postpartum. Among women who were euthymic at 25 weeks' GA, those who proceeded to develop PPD symptoms had higher levels of beta-endorphin throughout pregnancy compared to women without PPD symptoms (all t>2.11, p<.05). At each assessment, women above the cut-off score for beta-endorphin were at more than three-fold risk for PPD symptoms (odds ratios 3.19-4.68) compared to women below the cut-off score. Self-report of depressive symptoms, no mental health history. Beta-endorphin may be a useful early predictor of PPD symptoms in women who do not report depressive symptoms in mid-pregnancy. If replicated, these findings have clinical implications for the identification and treatment of this at-risk group and further suggest that some of the pathways leading to this complex disorder may be specific to subgroups of women.",2010
The role of beta-endorphin in the pathophysiology of major depression.,"A role for beta-endorphin (beta-END) in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is suggested by both animal research and studies examining clinical populations. The major etiological theories of depression include brain regions and neural systems that interact with opioid systems and beta-END. Recent preclinical data have demonstrated multiple roles for beta-END in the regulation of complex homeostatic and behavioural processes that are affected during a depressive episode. Additionally, beta-END inputs to regulatory pathways involving feeding behaviours, motivation, and specific types of motor activity have important implications in defining the biological foundations for specific depressive symptoms. Early research linking beta-END to MDD did so in the context of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, where it was suggested that HPA axis dysregulation may account for depressive symptoms in some individuals. The primary aims of this paper are to use both preclinical and clinical research (a) to critically review data that explores potential roles for beta-END in the pathophysiology of MDD and (b) to highlight gaps in the literature that limit further development of etiological theories of depression and testable hypotheses. In addition to examining methodological and theoretical challenges of past clinical studies, we summarize studies that have investigated basal beta-END levels in MDD and that have used challenge tests to examine beta-END responses to a variety of experimental paradigms. A brief description of the synthesis, location in the CNS and behavioural pharmacology of this neuropeptide is also provided to frame this discussion. Given the lack of clinical improvement observed with currently available antidepressants in a significant proportion of depressed individuals, it is imperative that novel mechanisms be investigated for antidepressant potential. We conclude that the renewed interest in elucidating the role of beta-END in the pathophysiology of MDD must be paralleled by consensus building within the research community around the heterogeneity inherent in mood disorders, standardization of experimental protocols, improved discrimination of POMC products in analytical techniques and consistent attention paid to important confounds like age and gender.",2009
Interaction between serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and beta-endorphins modulates antidepressant response.,"Interactions between serotonergic and the endogenous opioid systems have been suggested to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of depression and in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors has been shown to increase plasma beta-endorphin (beta-END) levels in animal studies and in healthy humans. To assess interaction abnormalities between 5-HT1A receptors and the endogenous opioid system in patients with major depression and the possible modulating effect of citalopram. The beta-END response to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone (30 mg), was measured in 30 patients with major depression and in 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls before and after an 8-week treatment with citalopram. Pre-treatment score of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was >or=17. Antidepressant response was defined by a 50% decrease in the HRSD. Pre- and post-treatment maximum peak response (Deltamax) and the area under the curve (AUC) of beta-END response were compared. Three time points were measured (60, 90 and 120 min). We also examined the correlations between the beta-END response and the antidepressant response. Buspirone plasma levels were not measured. At baseline, beta-END response was similar in patients and controls. After 8 weeks of citalopram treatment depressed patients showed a significant decrease in the beta-END response (Deltamax: p<.001; AUC: p<.001). A significant correlation between the beta-END reduction in the response and the reduction in the HRSD score (r=.656; p<.001) was observed. Changes in interaction between 5-HT1A receptor system and the endogenous opioid system may play a role both in the mechanism of action and response to antidepressant drugs.",2008
Adapted cold shower as a potential treatment for depression.,"Depression is a debilitating mood disorder that is among the top causes of disability worldwide. It can be characterized by a set of somatic, emotional, and behavioral symptoms, one of which is a high risk of suicide. This work presents a hypothesis that depression may be caused by the convergence of two factors: (A) A lifestyle that lacks certain physiological stressors that have been experienced by primates through millions of years of evolution, such as brief changes in body temperature (e.g. cold swim), and this lack of ""thermal exercise"" may cause inadequate functioning of the brain. (B) Genetic makeup that predisposes an individual to be affected by the above condition more seriously than other people. To test the hypothesis, an approach to treating depression is proposed that consists of adapted cold showers (20 degrees C, 2-3 min, preceded by a 5-min gradual adaptation to make the procedure less shocking) performed once or twice daily. The proposed duration of treatment is several weeks to several months. The following evidence appears to support the hypothesis: Exposure to cold is known to activate the sympathetic nervous system and increase the blood level of beta-endorphin and noradrenaline and to increase synaptic release of noradrenaline in the brain as well. Additionally, due to the high density of cold receptors in the skin, a cold shower is expected to send an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain, which could result in an anti-depressive effect. Practical testing by a statistically insignificant number of people, who did not have sufficient symptoms to be diagnosed with depression, showed that the cold hydrotherapy can relieve depressive symptoms rather effectively. The therapy was also found to have a significant analgesic effect and it does not appear to have noticeable side effects or cause dependence. In conclusion, wider and more rigorous studies would be needed to test the validity of the hypothesis.",2008
Long-term immune-endocrine effects of bereavement: relationships with anxiety levels and mood.,"Psychological, endocrine and immune parameters were measured over a 6-month period in 14 healthy subjects who underwent an unpredictable acute emotional stress (e.g. sudden death of a loved one) compared with 14 controls who did not. Probands were profoundly stressed as assessed 10 days after bereavement by their scores on the Hamilton Rating Scales of Anxiety and Depression, adrenocorticotropin and cortisol plasma concentrations, and non-suppression in response to dexamethasone. Functional alterations of immune parameters, such as responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens, were found 40 days after bereavement. Despite a normal number of circulating lymphocyte subsets, the functional activity of natural killer (NK) cells was markedly reduced at day 40. Changes in the intracellular concentration of beta-endorphin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlated with anxiety and depression scores. Controls showed no changes in psychometric, endocrine and immune measures during the 6-month study. Cluster analysis revealed two groups of bereaved subjects with different patterns of immune and endocrine changes: (1) Five subjects, characterized by harm-avoidant temperament and long-lasting dysphoric mood, showed reduced responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens, decreased NK cell activity and non-suppression in response to dexamethasone that persisted for 6 months. (2) Nine subjects showed significant changes only during the early phase after bereavement. Our data suggest that the immunological consequences of stress do not simply overlap with psychological and endocrine alterations, and are particularly severe and long-lasting in a subgroup of subjects, indicating the importance of individual variability in the capacity to cope with stress.",2003
Fewer beta-endorphin expressing arcuate nucleus neurons and reduced beta-endorphinergic innervation of paraventricular neurons in schizophrenics and patients with depression.,"In order to elucidate whether the hypothalamic expression of beta-endorphin is altered in patients with mental disorders we studied the cellular localization of the peptide in arcuate nucleus neurons as well as the beta-endorphinergic innervation of paraventricular neurons in nine schizophrenics, six subjects with depression, and nine controls. A polyclonal antiserum against beta-endorphin was employed for the immunohistochemical detection of the peptide in sections of postmortem human brains. Quantitative analysis revealed that the number of beta-endorphin-containing arcuate neurons was statistically reduced in schizophrenics and depressives in comparison to controls. Moreover, the number of endorphinoceptive (i.e. beta-endorphin-innervated) paraventricular nerve cells was also lower in psychiatric patients than in control cases. Our results showing an altered endorphinergic system in human hypothalami of schizophrenics and depressives might contribute to a renewal of interest in this peptide as a possible factor of importance in psychiatric disorders.",2002
Clinical and biochemical observations during treatment of depression with electroacupuncture: a pilot study.,"Six patients suffering from major depression were treated with electroacupuncture. During 4 weeks of treatment, the total CPRS-S-A score decreased from 23.8 to 13.4 (p=0.0095). A decrease of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in plasma during the first 2 weeks of treatment was noted in five of the patients, all being women (p=0.0431). The decrease was negatively correlated with age (rs=-0.29; p=0.046). The results are in line with a putative antidepressive effect of electroacupuncture, along with an influence on NPY in plasma.",2002
A cross-national relationship between sugar consumption and major depression?,"We have preliminarily investigated the hypothesis that sugar consumption may impact the prevalence of major depression by correlating per capita consumption of sugar with the prevalence of major depression. Major depression prevalence data (annual rate/100) was obtained from the Cross-National Epidemiology of Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder study [Weissman et al., 1996]. Sugar consumption data from 1991 was obtained from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. For the primary analysis, sugar consumption rates (cal/cap/day) were correlated with the annual rate of major depression, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. For the six countries with available data for the primary analysis, there was a highly significant correlation between sugar consumption and the annual rate of depression (Pearson correlation 0.948, P=0.004). Naturally, a correlation does not necessarily imply etiology. Caveats such as the limited number of countries with available data must be considered. Although speculative, there are some mechanistic reasons to consider that sugar consumption may directly impact the prevalence of major depression. Possible relationships between sugar consumption, beta-endorphins, and oxidative stress are discussed.",2002
Possible role of the endogenous opioid system in the placebo response in depression.,,2002
Plasma corticotropin-releasing factor in depressed patients before and after the dexamethasone suppression test.,"Plasma cortisol, beta-endorphin, corticotropin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and salivary cortisol concentrations, resting and after ingestion of 1 mg of dexamethasone, were investigated in depressed patients and controls. Fourteen outpatients from the psychiatric department diagnosed with depressive disorder (ICD-10 Classification) participated in the study. The comparison group consisted of 12 healthy volunteers from the hospital staff. All hormones were measured using direct iodine-125 radioimmunoassay, except corticotropin-releasing factor, which included a sample preextraction and concentration step. The basal plasma cortisol and corticotropin-releasing factor levels in depressive disorder were significantly higher than in the healthy group. After dexamethasone administration, corticotropin-releasing factor plasma values decreased significantly in the depressed group, but showed no significant changes in the controls. In depressive disorder baseline values correlated significantly for salivary cortisol and plasma cortisol, salivary cortisol and plasma corticotropin-releasing factor and plasma corticotropin and beta-endorphin. Similar correlations were found in the healthy subjects, except for salivary cortisol and plasma corticotropin-releasing factor. These findings indicate that the increased corticotropin-releasing factor plasma concentrations demonstrated in depressive disorder reflect the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor hypersecretion evidenced in this illness. Therefore, measurements of plasma corticotropin-releasing factor levels can be considered a reliable tool for investigating the role of this peptide in the pathophysiology of depression.",2002
Hormonal evidence for altered responsiveness to social stress in major depression.,"In patients with major depression, abnormalities in baseline cortisol secretion and resistance to negative feedback are well established. However, it is unclear if patients with major depression have alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to stressors. While other challenges to the HPA axis have used endocrine stimuli such as insulin-induced hypoglycemia, we now report of the response to a social stressor in patients with major depression and matched control subjects. We used the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a public speaking task followed by mental arithmetic challenge in front of a panel of judges. The results suggest that depressed patients manifest normal cortisol response to a social stressor, despite increased pre-stressor plasma cortisol. However, the beta-endorphin response to the TSST was significantly smaller in the depressed patients compared to matched controls. These data are similar to data found with exogenous corticotropin-releasing-hormone challenge studies and suggest that elevated baseline cortisol can modulate the pituitary corticotroph response to a stressor, but that changes in adrenal sensitivity to ACTH result in a robust cortisol response to this stressor.",2000
Normal pituitary response to metyrapone in the morning in depressed patients: implications for circadian regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion.,"Excess secretion of cortisol in depressed patients has been documented by a number of investigators, which is presumed secondary to increased corticotropin (ACTH) and ACTH-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion. To unmask the proposed increased central (CRH) drive, we administered metyrapone in the AM to 13 depressed and 13 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Metyrapone administration resulted in a prompt decrease in plasma cortisol and in an increase in 11-deoxycortisol, the inactive precursor, in all subjects. Both depressed patients and normal control subjects demonstrated clear increases in ACTH and beta-lipotropin/beta-endorphin production. There were no significant differences between patients and controls in any hormonal measures following metyrapone administration. These data suggest that: 1) in the absence of negative feedback (cortisol blockade), mildly to moderately depressed outpatients do not manifest increased central drive in the morning; and 2) the secretory capacity of the corticotropes do not differ between such depressed patients and controls.",1997
The association between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and other mood disorders.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a premenstrual mood disorder that cyclically recurs during the majority of menstrual cycles. It is included under the category of ""depressive disorders not otherwise specified"" in DSM-IV. Given the placement of PMDD with other mood disorders in DSM-IV, the evidence suggesting an association between PMDD and other mood disorders is examined. Primary reports on the epidemiology, phenomenology, family history, psychobiology, and treatment of PMDD were examined for features that are commonly found in other mood disorders. There is an overlap in the symptoms experienced by women with PMDD and patients with other mood disorders. As in patients with other mood disorders, past episodes of mood disorder and family history of mood disorder are common in women with PMDD. Selected biological markers differentiate women with PMDD from controls, and some but not all antidepressants are effective in the treatment of PMDD. Many features of PMDD support its inclusion in the DSM-IV category of mood disorders. However, a number of factors (biological and cognitive studies, treatment response) differentiate PMDD from other mood disorders.",1997
Stimulatory effects of L-5-hydroxytryptophan on postdexamethasone beta-endorphin levels in major depression.,"Recently it has been shown that acute administration of 200 mg L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) PO may increase post-dexamethasone (DST) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels in major, but not minor, depressed subjects. This study aimed to examine the effects of 200 mg L-5-HTP PO on post-DST beta-endorphin levels in the same depressed subjects. It was found that in major, but not minor, depressed subjects, L-5-HTP significantly increased post-DST beta-endorphin concentrations as compared to placebo. The L-5-HTP-induced post-DST beta-endorphin responses were significantly higher in major than in minor depressed subjects. There was a significant and positive relationship between L-5-HTP-induced post-DST beta-endorphin and ACTH or cortisol responses. There was a significant and positive relationship between L-5-HTP-induced post-DST beta-endorphin values and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score. The results show that the acute administration of L-5-HTP may increase the escape of beta-endorphin secretion from suppression by dexamethasone in major, but not minor, depression.",1996
Beta-endorphin concentration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of elderly depressed patients--effects of phosphatidylserine therapy.,"beta-Endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 10 elderly women with major depressive disorders, 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls and 10 young healthy controls. beta-EP values were measured in resting condition and after stimulation with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). In patients, beta-EP values were measured in drug-free condition and after 30 days of treatment with phosphatidylserine (BCPS), 200 mg/day, p.o. Basal and CRH-stimulated beta-EP concentrations were the same in patients and controls; in patients they did not change after BCPS, in spite of significant improvement of the depressive symptomatology.",1996
Evidence against changes in corticotroph CRF receptors in depressed patients.,"Previous studies by a number have investigators have documented a decreased adrenocortotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin/beta-endorphin (beta-End) response to ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (oCRF) in depressed patients. Since depressed patients demonstrate higher plasma cortisol concentrations at the time of oCRF challenge, it is difficult to determine if the decreased ACTH response is due to enhanced negative feedback of cortisol on ACTH release or an alteration in CRF receptors in depressed patients. To evaluate the response to oCRF in an ""open feedback loop"" system, we administered metyrapone 750 mg at 4 PM and 7:30 PM, followed by administration of oCRF 0.3 microgram/kg at 8 PM in 10 normal controls and 10 depressed patients. Administration of metyrapone at this time in the circadian rhythm clamped plasma cortisol concentrations to less than 2 micrograms/dl but did not result in rebound ACTH or beta-End secretion in control subjects. In control subjects, metyrapone administration produced a 85% blockade of the cortisol response as well as a 3-fold greater beta-End response compared to administration of the same dose of oCRF without metyrapone. The 10 depressed patients and their matched controls demonstrated identical beta-End responses (integrated response for controls = 291 +/- 61, for patients = 352 +/- 86) and cortisol responses (integrated response for controls = 187 +/- 38, for patients = 206 +/- 52) to oCRF following metyrapone pretreatment. These data confirm that corticotroph CRF receptors are normal in depressed patients, and that cortisol feedback plays an essential role in the abnormal ACTH and beta-End response to oCRF in depressed patients.",1995
"Adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin and cortisol responses to oCRH in unipolar depressed patients pretreated with dexamethasone.","1. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (ovine CRH, 100 micrograms intravenous bolus) was given to 63 unipolar depressed inpatients following the 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST). The depressed patients included 18 minor, 24 simple major and 21 melancholic subtypes. 2. Baseline or postdexamethasone plasma levels of intact adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin (beta END/beta LPH), cortisol, and dexamethasone were measured, as well as the post DST+CRH hormone responses. 3. CRH administration 9.5 hr after dexamethasone resulted in a significant enhancement of ACTH, beta END/beta LPH and cortisol secretion. The post DST+CRH ACTH and beta END/beta LPH- but not cortisol-values exceeded their baseline hormone levels. The post DST+CRH ACTH--but not beta END/beta LPH or cortisol-levels were significantly higher in major depressives compared to minor depressives. The post DST+CRH ACTH and beta END/beta LPH--but not cortisol-levels were significantly higher in DST nonsuppressors than suppressors. The post DST+CRH ACTH levels were significantly and positively related to severity of illness. 4. The results provide evidence that the pathophysiology underlying the abnormal DST+CRH and DST tests in melancholia is localized at the pituitary level and may consist of a CRH-driven breakthrough of corticotropic cell secretion synergized by central and peripheral agents, in conjunction with a decrease in glucocorticoid feedback suppressibility.",1994
Effects of the menstrual cycle on dependent variables in mood disorder research.,"The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the effects of the menstrual cycle on dependent variables in mood disorder research to inform investigators which physiological measures are likely to be significantly affected by menstrual cycle fluctuations and precisely how they might be affected. The following variables are discussed: prolactin; growth hormone; the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (including thyrotropin, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine); the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol, corticotropin, and beta-endorphin); melatonin; sleep; body temperature; and neurotransmitter activity (serotonergic and adrenergic systems). Body temperature and plasma and urinary norepinephrine vary predictably over the menstrual cycle. Prolactin and beta-endorphin may have peaks in the periovulatory phase, whereas serotonin levels in platelet-poor plasma may reach a nadir at that time. Triiodothyronine, thyroxine, cortisol, and melatonin do not appear to vary systematically over the course of the menstrual cycle, whereas the data for growth hormone, thyrotropin, corticotropin, and sleep are inconclusive.",1994
Increased evening activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in depressed patients.,"To determine whether depressed patients demonstrate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation during the late afternoon and evening, a time when the HPA axis is usually quiescent in normal subjects. We administered metyrapone, an 11-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor of cortisol synthesis, to normal controls and depressed patients between 4 and 10 PM. Metyrapone blockade of cortisol secretion would amplify any HPA axis secretion. In 10 normal control subjects, administration of metyrapone lowered plasma cortisol levels to a mean of 36 nmol/L. No rebound corticotropin or beta-endorphin secretion was seen in these normal controls between 4 and 10 PM, supporting the existence of a period of minimal endogenous corticotropin releasing factor drive. Compared with a group of placebo-treated depressed patients (n = 10), metyrapone-treated depressed subjects (n = 17) had significantly decreased plasma cortisol concentrations. However, in contrast to normal controls treated with metyrapone, metyrapone-treated depressed patients demonstrated rebound corticotroph secretion, particularly between 7:30 and 10 PM (P = .036 for patients vs normal controls for beta-endorphin secretion from 4:30 to 10 PM). These data support the hypothesis of increased corticotropin releasing factor drive in the evening in depressed subjects and are in agreement with the longstanding observation of ""early escape"" from dexamethasone suppression between 4 and 11 PM in depressed patients.",1994
"Glutamate plus glutamine to GABA ratio as a predictor of ketamine response in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, randomized, open-label extension study.","Approximately 30 % of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD.",2025
Alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate neurotransmission linked to intermittent theta-burst stimulation in depression: a sham-controlled study.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13) = 0.54, p = 0.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11) = 0.66, p = 0.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",2025
Lack of association between pretreatment glutamate/GABA and major depressive disorder treatment response.,"Studies have shown gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and Glx (a combination of glutamate and glutamine) to be altered in major depressive disorder (MDD). Using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), this study aimed to determine whether lower pretreatment GABA and Glx levels in the medial frontal cortex, a region implicated in MDD pathophysiology, are associated with better antidepressant treatment response. Participants with MDD (N = 74) were antidepressant naïve or medication-free for at least three weeks before imaging. Two MEGA-PRESS <sup>1</sup>H-MRS acquisitions were collected, interleaved with a water unsuppressed reference scan. GABA and Glx concentrations were quantified from an average difference spectrum, with preprocessing using Gannet and spectral fitting using TARQUIN. Following imaging, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied with treatment type and age as covariates. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing was used to interpret the strength of the evidence. No significant association was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA, or Glx/GABA and depression remission status or the continuous outcome, percent change in symptom severity. In an exploratory analysis, no significant correlation was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA or Glx/GABA and days to response. Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence towards the null hypotheses in all cases. To date, there are no replicated biomarkers in psychiatry. To address this, well-powered, placebo-controlled trials need to be undertaken and reported. The present analysis suggests pretreatment GABA, Glx, or their ratio cannot predict antidepressant treatment response. Future direction including examining glutamate and glutamine separately or examining biological subtypes of MDD separately.Trial Name: Advancing Personalized Antidepressant Treatment Using PET/MRI.Registration Number: NCT02623205 URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02623205.",2025
"Venlafaxine treatment is associated with improved mood, but not decreased cocaine self-administration, in depressed people who use cocaine.","Individuals seeking treatment for their cocaine use often report depressive systems and nearly half meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). This descriptive study aimed to assess the effects of the antidepressant venlafaxine alone and in combination with gabapentin on depressive symptoms, subjective effects of cocaine, and cocaine self-administration in depressed and non-depressed people who use cocaine. The effects of medication condition on mood and on the effects of smoked cocaine were compared between a group of clinically depressed people who use cocaine (n = 5) and a control group of non-depressed people who use cocaine (n = 5) using laboratory-based measures. In the MDD group, venlafaxine (300 mg/day) was associated with reduced mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores (35 to <5) and marginally lower ratings of ""good drug effect"" without affecting cocaine ""wanting"" or cocaine (0-50 mg) self-administration. In both groups, venlafaxine treatment increased resting heart rate, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure. The addition of gabapentin (2400 mg/day) had no effect relative to venlafaxine alone for either group. Conclusions regarding venlafaxine's effectiveness in treating depression in the MDD group are tempered by the lack of a venlafaxine placebo condition and by reductions in BDI scores associated with abstinence prior to venlafaxine administration. Further research is necessary to identify effective treatments for depressed people who use cocaine.",2025
The impact of ACTH levels on neurotransmitters and antioxidants in patients with major depressive disorder: A novel investigation.,"The relationship between neurotransmitters and oxidative stress in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients, considering HPA axis activity and psychological and cognitive states, is unclear. This study examines changes in neurotransmitters (GABA, Glx) and antioxidants (GSH) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of MDD patients under varying levels of ACTH, and their relationship with psychological and cognitive conditions. Forty-five MDD patients were divided into high-ACTH (>65 pg/mL; n = 16) and normal-ACTH (7-65 pg/mL; n = 29) groups based on blood ACTH levels, along with 12 healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent HAM-D, HAM-A assessments, and most completed MMSE and MoCA tests. GABA+, Glx, and GSH levels in the dACC were measured using the MEGA-PRESS sequence. Intergroup differences and correlations between clinical factors, HPA axis activity, and metabolites were analyzed. Compared to HC, the normal ACTH group showed higher Glx and lower GSH levels. Glx and GSH were negatively correlated with MDD severity. In the high-ACTH MDD group, Glx positively correlated with delayed memory, and GSH positively correlated with abstraction. Factors influencing GABA included ACTH levels, depression duration, and negative events. Predictive factors for HAM-D scores were GSH and GABA. The sample size is small. MDD patients exhibit neurochemical differences in the brain related to HPA axis levels, MDD severity, and cognitive function. Clinical factors, neurotransmitters, and neuroendocrine levels significantly influence depression severity.",2024
Novel insight into astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission modulates the synaptic plasticity in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a form of glial cell-based synaptic dysfunction disease in which glial cells interact closely with neuronal synapses and perform synaptic information processing. Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, are active components of the brain and are responsible for synaptic activity through the release gliotransmitters. A reduced density of astrocytes and astrocyte dysfunction have both been identified the brains of patients with MDD. Furthermore, gliotransmission, i.e., active information transfer mediated by gliotransmitters between astrocytes and neurons, is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. However, the mechanism by which astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission contributes to depression remains unknown. This review therefore summarizes the alterations in astrocytes in MDD, including astrocyte marker, connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, Cx43 gap junctions, and Cx43 hemichannels, and describes the regulatory mechanisms of astrocytes involved in synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms acting of the glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and purinergic systems that modulate synaptic function and the antidepressant mechanisms of the related receptor antagonists. Further, we summarize the roles of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, d-serine, and adenosine triphosphate in depression, providing a basis for the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for MDD.",2024
Medial prefrontal cortex neurotransmitter abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder with and without comorbidity to major depression.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric condition that follows exposure to a traumatic stressor. Though previous in vivo proton (<sup>1</sup>H) MRS) research conducted at 4 T or lower has identified alterations in glutamate metabolism associated with PTSD predisposition and/or progression, no prior investigations have been conducted at higher field strength. In addition, earlier studies have not extensively addressed the impact of psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD) on PTSD-associated <sup>1</sup>H-MRS-visible brain metabolite abnormalities. Here we employ 7 T <sup>1</sup>H MRS to examine concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and glutathione in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of PTSD patients with MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD+</sub>; N = 6) or without MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD-</sub>; N = 5), as well as trauma-unmatched controls without PTSD but with MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD+</sub>; N = 9) or without MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub>; N = 18). Participants with PTSD demonstrated decreased ratios of GABA to glutamine relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls but no single-metabolite abnormalities. When comorbid MDD was considered, however, MDD but not PTSD diagnosis was significantly associated with increased mPFC glutamine concentration and decreased glutamate:glutamine ratio. In addition, all participants with PTSD and/or MDD collectively demonstrated decreased glutathione relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls. Despite limited findings in single metabolites, patterns of abnormality in prefrontal metabolite concentrations among individuals with PTSD and/or MDD enabled supervised classification to separate them from healthy controls with 80+% sensitivity and specificity, with glutathione, glutamine, and myoinositol consistently among the most informative metabolites for this classification. Our findings indicate that MDD can be an important factor in mPFC glutamate metabolism abnormalities observed using <sup>1</sup>H MRS in cohorts with PTSD.",2024
Association of Lower Rostral Anterior Cingulate GABA+ and Dysregulated Cortisol Stress Response With Altered Functional Connectivity in Young Adults With Lifetime Depression: A Multimodal Imaging Investigation of Trait and State Effects.,"Preclinical work suggests that excess glucocorticoids and reduced cortical γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may affect sex-dependent differences in brain regions implicated in stress regulation and depressive phenotypes. The authors sought to address a critical gap in knowledge, namely, how stress circuitry is functionally affected by glucocorticoids and GABA in current or remitted major depressive disorder (MDD). Multimodal imaging data were collected from 130 young adults (ages 18-25), of whom 44 had current MDD, 42 had remitted MDD, and 44 were healthy comparison subjects. GABA+ (γ-aminobutyric acid and macromolecules) was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and task-related functional MRI data were collected under acute stress and analyzed using data-driven network modeling. Across modalities, trait-related abnormalities emerged. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both clinical groups were characterized by lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) GABA+ and frontoparietal network amplitude but higher amplitude in salience and stress-related networks. For the remitted MDD group, differences from the healthy comparison group emerged in the context of elevated cortisol levels, whereas the MDD group had lower cortisol levels than the healthy comparison group. In the comparison group, frontoparietal and stress-related network connectivity was positively associated with cortisol level (highlighting putative top-down regulation of stress), but the opposite relationship emerged in the MDD and remitted MDD groups. Finally, rACC GABA+ was associated with stress-induced changes in connectivity between overlapping default mode and salience networks. Lifetime MDD was characterized by reduced rACC GABA+ as well as dysregulated cortisol-related interactions between top-down control (frontoparietal) and threat (task-related) networks. These findings warrant further investigation of the role of GABA in the vulnerability to and treatment of MDD.",2024
"Effects of GABA, Sex, and Stress on Reward Learning in Current and Remitted Major Depression.","Neurocognitive factors including aberrant reward learning, blunted GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), and potentiated stress sensitivity have been linked to anhedonia, a hallmark depressive symptom, possibly in a sex-dependent manner. However, previous research has not investigated the putative associations among these factors or the extent to which they represent trait- or state-based vulnerabilities for depression. Young adults with current major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 44), remitted MDD (n = 42), and healthy control participants (HCs) (n = 44), stratified by sex assigned at birth, underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess macromolecular contaminated GABA (GABA+) and then a reward learning task before and after acute stress. We assessed changes in reward learning after stress and associations with GABA+. Results revealed blunted baseline reward learning in participants with remitted MDD versus participants with current MDD and HCs but, surprisingly, no differences between participants with current MDD and HCs. Reward learning was reduced following acute stress regardless of depressive history. GABA+ in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, but not the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was associated with reduced baseline reward learning only in female participants. GABA+ did not predict stress-related changes in reward learning. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate associations among GABA, reward learning, and stress reactivity in current versus past depression. Hypothesized depression-related differences in reward learning did not emerge, precluding claims about state versus trait vulnerabilities. However, our finding that blunted GABA was associated with greater reward learning in female participants provides novel insights into sex-selective associations between the frontal GABAergic inhibitory system and reward processing.",2024
Neurophysiological evidence that frontoparietal connectivity and GABA-A receptor changes underpin the antidepressant response to ketamine.,"Revealing the acute cortical pharmacodynamics of an antidepressant dose of ketamine in humans with depression is key to determining the specific mechanism(s) of action for alleviating symptoms. While the downstream effects are characterised by increases in plasticity and reductions in depressive symptoms-it is the acute response in the brain that triggers this cascade of events. Computational modelling of cortical interlaminar and cortico-cortical connectivity and receptor dynamics provide the opportunity to interrogate this question using human electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during a ketamine infusion. Here, resting-state EEG was recorded in a group of 30 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline and during a 0.44 mg/kg ketamine dose comprising a bolus and infusion. Fronto-parietal connectivity was assessed using dynamic causal modelling to fit a thalamocortical model to hierarchically connected nodes in the medial prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule. We found a significant increase in parietal-to-frontal AMPA-mediated connectivity and a significant decrease in the frontal GABA time constant. Both parameter changes were correlated across participants with the antidepressant response to ketamine. Changes to the NMDA receptor time constant and inhibitory intraneuronal input into superficial pyramidal cells did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and were not correlated with the antidepressant response. These results provide evidence that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may be mediated by acute fronto-parietal connectivity and GABA receptor dynamics. Furthermore, it supports the large body of literature suggesting the acute mechanism underlying ketamine's antidepressant properties is related to GABA-A and AMPA receptors rather than NMDA receptor antagonism.",2024
Astrocytic GABAergic Regulation in Alcohol Use and Major Depressive Disorders.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). Most GABAergic neurons synthesize GABA from glutamate and release it in the synaptic cleft in the CNS. However, astrocytes can also synthesize and release GABA, activating GABA receptors in the neighboring neurons in physiological and pathological conditions. As the primary homeostatic glial cells in the brain, astrocytes play a crucial role in regulating GABA homeostasis and synaptic neurotransmission. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that astrocytic GABA dysregulation is implicated in psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the most prevalent co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Several current medications and emerging pharmacological agents targeting GABA levels are in clinical trials for treating AUD and MDD. This review offers a concise summary of the role of astrocytic GABA regulation in AUD and MDD. We also provide an overview of the current understanding and areas of debate regarding the mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate GABA in the CNS and their potential significance in the molecular basis of AUD and MDD, paving the way toward future research directions and potential therapeutic target areas within this field.",2024
"Zuranolone, a neuroactive drug, used in the treatment of postpartum depression by modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.","Postpartum depression [PPD] is a prevalent and debilitating mood disorder that affects mothers in the weeks to months after childbirth. Zuranolone (Zurzuvae) is a novel pharmaceutical agent that was approved by the US FDA on 4 August 2023 for the management of PPD. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of zuranolone, focusing on its dosing, chemistry, mechanism of action, clinical trials, adverse drug reaction, and overall conclusion regarding its utility in the management of PPD. It also discusses the recommended dosing strategies to achieve optimal efficacy while minimizing adverse effects as the dosage regimen of zuranolone is critical for its therapeutic application. Moreover, it gives insights into neurobiological pathways involved in PPD. Data from randomized controlled trials and observational studies was collected to provide a comprehensive understanding of zuranolone in the management and treatment of PPD. Zuranolone represents a promising therapeutic option for women suffering from postpartum depression. However, ongoing research and post-marketing surveillance are essential to further elucidate its long-term safety and efficacy. The integration of zuranolone into clinical practice may significantly improve the quality of life for mothers facing the challenges of postpartum depression.",2024
NAc-DBS corrects depression-like behaviors in CUMS mouse model via disinhibition of DA neurons in the VTA.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include loss of motivation and anhedonia. If multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy fail in some patients with MDD, their condition is then termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MDD can be associated with abnormalities in the reward-system-dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, in which the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) play major roles. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the NAc alleviates the depressive symptoms of MDD. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of this DBS has remained elusive. In this study, using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we investigated the behavioral and neurobiological effects of NAc-DBS on the multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by CUMS by integrating behavioral, in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), calcium imaging, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation methods in freely moving mice. We found that long-term and repeated, but not single, NAc-DBS induced robust antidepressant responses in CUMS mice. Moreover, even a single trial NAc-DBS led to the elevation of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, accompanied by the increase in dopamine (DA) neuron activity in the VTA. Both the inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity and knockdown of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α1 gene in VTA-GABA neurons blocked the antidepressant effect of NAc-DBS in CUMS mice. Our results showed that NAc-DBS could disinhibit VTA-DA neurons by regulating the level of GABA and the activity of VTA-GABA in the VTA and could finally correct the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mouse model.",2024
The impact of matching for reproductive status on the comparison of magnetic spectroscopic measurements of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid + in the medial prefrontal cortex of women with major depression.,"The role played by medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the pathophysiology and the treatment of major depression (MD) is increasingly recognized. Although measurements of MPFC GABA and Glu have been shown to be sensitive to physiological fluctuations of female hormones, none of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) investigations of MPFC Glu and GABA in MD have controlled for possible bias effect of the reproductive stage of the women included. MPFC Glu and GABA+ (which include homocarnosine and macromolecules) referenced to creatine and phosphocreatine, were measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using a 3-Tesla magnet in 24 women with MD and 24 healthy women paired for reproductive status. All participants were unmedicated. There were no statistical differences in either MPFC Glu [95 % CI: (-0.025, 0.034)] or MPFC GABA+ [95 % CI: (-0.005, 0.017)] between women with MD and healthy controls. Our investigation does not support abnormalities in measurement of MPFC Glu and GABA in MD women when stringent control for reproductive status is performed. As a result of the inherent limitations of MRS methodology, our results do not preclude glutamatergic and GABAergic dysregulations in the MPFC of women with MD.",2024
"Dysfunction of neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the severity of depression in first-diagnosed, drug-naïve depressed patients.","Biochemical changes of neurotransmitters underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) are unknown. This study preliminarily explored the association between neurotransmitters with MDD and the possibility of objective laboratory prediction of neurotransmitter involvement in MDD. A total of 87 first-diagnosed, drug-naïve patients with depression and 50 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the cross-sectional study. The levels and turnovers of neurotransmitters (glutamine (GLN), glutamic acid (GLU), γ-2Aminobutiric acid (GABA), kainate (KA), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), 3-methoxy 4-hydroxyphenyl ethylene glycol (MHPG), noradrenaline (NE), homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), dopamine (DA), tryptophane (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) were determined and the confounding factors were adjusted. Then a correlation and a predictive analysis towards neurotransmitters for MDD were performed. After adjusting confounding factors, GLU (OR = 1.159), (GLU+ GABA)/GLN (OR = 1.217), DOPAC (OR = 1.106), DOPAC/DA (OR = 1.089) and (DOPAC+ HVA)/DA (OR = 1.026) enacted as risk factors of MDD, while KYN (OR = 0.992) was a protective factor. GABAergic and TRPergic pathways were associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with depression. The predictive model for MDD (AUC = 0.775, 95%CI 0.683-0.860) consisted of KYN (OR = 0.990) and (GLU + GABA)/GLN (OR = 4.101). First-diagnosed, drug-naïve depression patients showed abnormal neurotransmitter composition. GLU, (GLU + GABA)/GLN, DOPAC, DOPAC/DA and (DOPAC + HVA)/DA were risk factors of MDD, while KYN was a protective factor. GABAergic and TRPergic pathways were correlated with MDD clinical characteristics. KYN and (GLU + GABA)/GLN may have a predictive value for MDD.",2024
GABAA Receptor Availability in Relation to Cortical Excitability in Depressed and Healthy: A Positron Emission Tomography and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) deficiency is suggested in depressive disorders, along with alterations in cortical excitability. However, whether these excitability changes are related to GABAA receptor availability is largely unknown. Our aim was to assess the correlation between these measures in depressed patients and healthy controls. Twenty-eight patients with a major depressive episode, measured before and after participating in a clinical trial with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and 15 controls underwent [11C]flumazenil positron emission tomography to assess GABAA receptor availability and paired pulse TMS (ppTMS) to evaluate cortical excitability. Both whole-brain voxel-wise GABAA receptor availability and mean values from left hand motor cortex and left paracentral lobule were correlated to the ppTMS outcomes: short-interval intracortical inhibition reflecting GABAA receptor activity, long-interval intracortical inhibition representing GABAB receptor activity, intracortical facilitation reflecting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activity, as well as the resting motor threshold (rMT), considered a global measure of corticospinal excitability. No significant differences in baseline GABAA receptor availability or cortical excitability were found between patients and controls. Additionally, no correlations were observed between baseline measurements of GABAA receptor availability and TMS outcomes. Changes in GABAA receptor availability in the hand motor cortex, between pre- and post-assessments, were inversely related to pre-post changes in hand rMT. We found that a change in GABAA receptor availability was inversely related to a change in rMT, suggesting a link between GABA deficiency and increased rMT previously observed in depressive episodes. The results highlight the complex mechanisms governing cortical excitability measures and offer new insight into their properties during the depressive state.",2024
GABAergic neuroactive steroid response to sertraline in premenstrual dysphoric disorder.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects approximately 5% of menstruating individuals, with significant negative mood symptoms in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. PMDD's pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms are poorly characterized, but may involve altered neuroactive steroid function in the brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a first-line PMDD treatment, reportedly alter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuroactive steroid levels in PMDD. The aims of this study were to determine whether the SSRI sertraline increased serum levels of neuroactive steroids that modulate the effect of GABA at GABA-A receptors (GABAAR) and if so, whether an increase was associated with improvement in PMDD symptoms. Participants included controls and individuals with PMDD. Serum levels of 9 neuroactive steroids were measured (3α,5α-THP; 3α5β-THP; pregnenolone; 3α,5α-androsterone; 3α,5β-androsterone; 3α,5α-A-diol; 3α5β-A-diol; 3α,5α-THDOC; 3α5β-THDOC) in the follicular and luteal phases. In the subsequent luteal phase, neuroactive steroids were measured during sertraline treatment (50 mg sertraline from approximate ovulation to menses onset) in the PMDD group. Mixed models assessed associations among diagnostic group, menstrual cycle phase, and sertraline treatment. Participants included 38 controls and 32 women with PMDD. There were no significant differences in neuroactive steroid levels between controls and participants with PMDD in the luteal phase (p > 0.05). Within the PMDD group, sertraline treatment significantly increased serum pregnanolone levels and the pregnanolone:progesterone ratio, and decreased 3α,5α-androsterone. This was the first study to assess the impact of SSRI treatment on peripheral levels of GABAergic neuroactive steroids in PMDD. Within the PMDD group, sertraline treatment was associated with a significant increase in luteal phase serum pregnanolone levels and a significantly increased pregnanolone:progesterone ratio, a novel finding. Future research should examine alterations in the metabolic pathways among GABAergic neuroactive steroids in individuals with PMDD, in a placebo-controlled design.",2024
Cryo-EM structures reveal native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor assemblies and pharmacology.,"Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are the principal inhibitory receptors in the brain and the target of a wide range of clinical agents, including anaesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics and antidepressants<sup>1-3</sup>. However, our understanding of GABA<sub>A</sub>R pharmacology has been hindered by the vast number of pentameric assemblies that can be derived from 19 different subunits<sup>4</sup> and the lack of structural knowledge of clinically relevant receptors. Here, we isolate native murine GABA<sub>A</sub>R assemblies containing the widely expressed α1 subunit and elucidate their structures in complex with drugs used to treat insomnia (zolpidem (ZOL) and flurazepam) and postpartum depression (the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (APG)). Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis and single-molecule photobleaching experiments, we uncover three major structural populations in the brain: the canonical α1β2γ2 receptor containing two α1 subunits, and two assemblies containing one α1 and either an α2 or α3 subunit, in which the single α1-containing receptors feature a more compact arrangement between the transmembrane and extracellular domains. Interestingly, APG is bound at the transmembrane α/β subunit interface, even when not added to the sample, revealing an important role for endogenous neurosteroids in modulating native GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Together with structurally engaged lipids, neurosteroids produce global conformational changes throughout the receptor that modify the ion channel pore and the binding sites for GABA and insomnia medications. Our data reveal the major α1-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R assemblies, bound with endogenous neurosteroid, thus defining a structural landscape from which subtype-specific drugs can be developed.",2023
Potentiated GABAergic neuronal activities in the basolateral amygdala alleviate stress-induced depressive behaviors.,"Major depressive disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder that afflicts ~17% of the world population. Neuroimaging investigations of depressed patients have consistently reported the dysfunction of the basolateral amygdala in the pathophysiology of depression. However, how the BLA and related circuits are implicated in the pathogenesis of depression is poorly understood. Here, we combined fiber photometry, immediate early gene expression (c-fos), optogenetics, chemogenetics, behavioral analysis, and viral tracing techniques to provide multiple lines of evidence of how the BLA neurons mediate depressive-like behavior. We demonstrated that the aversive stimuli elevated the neuronal activity of the excitatory BLA neurons (BLA<sup>CAMKII</sup> neurons). Optogenetic activation of CAMKII neurons facilitates the induction of depressive-like behavior while inhibition of these neurons alleviates the depressive-like behavior. Next, we found that the chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the BLA (BLA<sup>GABA</sup> ) increased the firing frequency of CAMKII neurons and mediates the depressive-like phenotypes. Finally, through fiber photometry recording and chemogenetic manipulation, we proved that the activation of BLA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons inhibits BLA<sup>CAMKII</sup> neuronal activity and alleviates depressive-like behavior in the mice. Thus, through evaluating BLA<sup>GABA</sup> and BLA<sup>CAMKII</sup> neurons by distinct interaction, the BLA regulates depressive-like behavior.",2024
"Novel neurosteroid therapeutics for post-partum depression: perspectives on clinical trials, program development, active research, and future directions.","This article reviews novel neurosteroid therapeutics for post-partum depression, with a focus on their development, clinical trial data, current practices, and future directions in this exciting field. We discuss the clinical impact of brexanolone and several other neurosteroids, particularly as they relate to the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) and major depressive disorders outside of the perinatal period. There has been increasing interest in GABA signaling and modulation as it pertains to the development of altered circuity and depressive states. This scientific underpinning served as the rationale for the initial development of brexanolone. We review the clinical trials supporting its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as the first rapidly acting antidepressant specific for PPD, and the subsequent development of a clinical brexanolone program at an academic medical center, highlighting new research and data from that site as well as the challenges with the delivery of this I.V. drug. In addition to the GABA signaling hypothesis, we discuss the new evidence demonstrating that brexanolone inhibits inflammatory signaling post-infusion, suggesting that inflammatory signaling may contribute to the etiology of PPD. Finally, we describe new and future directions in neurosteroid therapeutics, including the development of an oral agent, zuranolone, and the IV and oral formulations of ganaxolone. Ultimately, the hope is that these novel neurosteroid therapeutics will provide fast-acting treatment for these impairing disorders and improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of depressive disorders.",2024
Metabolites for monitoring symptoms and predicting remission in patients with depression who received electroconvulsive therapy: a pilot study.,"The lack of biomarkers to monitor and predict the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has hindered its optimal use. To establish metabolomic markers for monitoring and predicting the treatment efficacy of ECT, we comprehensively evaluated metabolite levels in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by performing targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses using plasma samples before and after the first, third, and final ECT sessions, and 3-7 days after the final session. We compared the plasma metabolomes of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Thirteen hospitalized patients with MDD and their corresponding HCs were included in this study. We observed that patients with MDD exhibited lower levels of amino acids, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and metabolites involved in tryptophan metabolism and the kynurenine pathway, and higher levels of cortisol at baseline. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between metabolite levels and depression severity across seven measurement timepoints along with one correlation analysis and found that amino acids, including GABA and tryptophan catabolites, were significantly correlated with the severity of depression. Despite the exploratory nature of this study due to the limited sample size necessitating further validation, our findings suggest that the blood metabolic profile has potential as a biomarker for ECT.",2023
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors as targets for treating affective and cognitive symptoms of depression.,"In the past 20 years, our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression has evolved from a focus on an imbalance of monoaminergic neurotransmitters to a multifactorial picture including an improved understanding of the role of glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. FDA-approved treatments targeting the glutamatergic [esketamine for major depressive disorder (MDD)] and GABAergic (brexanolone for peripartum depression) systems have become available. This review focuses on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) system as a target for novel antidepressants and discusses the mechanisms by which modulation of δ-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with neuroactive steroids (NASs) or of α5-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs results in antidepressant or antidepressant-like actions and discusses clinical data on NASs. Moreover, a potential mechanism by which α5-GABA<sub>A</sub>R-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) may improve cognitive deficits in depression is presented.",2023
GABA-ergic Modulators: New Therapeutic Approaches to Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is characterized by the predictable onset of mood and physical symptoms secondary to gonadal steroid fluctuation during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Although menstrual-related affective dysfunction is responsible for considerable functional impairment and reduction in quality of life worldwide, currently approved treatments for PMDD are suboptimal in their effectiveness. Research over the past two decades has suggested that the interaction between allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid derivative of progesterone, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system represents an important relationship underlying symptom genesis in reproductive-related mood disorders, including PMDD. The objective of this narrative review is to discuss the plausible link between changes in GABAergic transmission secondary to the fluctuation of allopregnanolone during the luteal phase and mood impairment in susceptible individuals. As part of this discussion, we explore promising findings from early clinical trials of several compounds that stabilize allopregnanolone signaling during the luteal phase, including dutasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor; isoallopregnanolone, a GABA-A modulating steroid antagonist; and ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator. We then reflect on the implications of these therapeutic advances, including how they may promote our knowledge of affective regulation more generally. We conclude that these and other studies of PMDD may yield critical insight into the etiopathogenesis of affective disorders, considering that (1) symptoms in PMDD have a predictable onset and offset, allowing for examination of affective state kinetics, and (2) GABAergic interventions in PMDD can be used to better understand the relationship between mood states, network regulation, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain.",2023
"Quercetin Antagonizes the Sedative Effects of Linalool, Possibly through the GABAergic Interaction Pathway.","Sedatives promote calmness or sleepiness during surgery or severely stressful events. In addition, depression is a mental health issue that negatively affects emotional well-being. A group of drugs called anti-depressants is used to treat major depressive illnesses. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of quercetin (QUR) and linalool (LIN) on thiopental sodium (TS)-induced sleeping mice and to investigate the combined effects of these compounds using a conventional co-treatment strategy and <i>in silico</i> studies. For this, the TS-induced sleeping mice were monitored to compare the occurrence, latency, and duration of the sleep-in response to QUR (10, 25, 50 mg/kg), LIN (10, 25, 50 mg/kg), and diazepam (DZP, 3 mg/kg, i.p.). Moreover, an in silico investigation was undertaken to assess this study's putative modulatory sedation mechanism. For this, we observed the ability of test and standard medications to interact with various gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>) subunits. Results revealed that QUR and LIN cause dose-dependent antidepressant-like and sedative-like effects in animals, respectively. In addition, QUR-50 mg/kg and LIN-50 mg/kg and/or DZP-3 mg/kg combined were associated with an increased latency period and reduced sleeping times in animals. Results of the in silico studies demonstrated that QUR has better binding interaction with GABA<sub>A</sub> α3, β1, and γ2 subunits when compared with DZP, whereas LIN showed moderate affinity with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Taken together, the sleep duration of LIN and DZP is opposed by QUR in TS-induced sleeping mice, suggesting that QUR may be responsible for providing sedation-antagonizing effects through the GABAergic interaction pathway.",2023
Brain-wide changes in excitation-inhibition balance of major depressive disorder: a systematic review of topographic patterns of GABA- and glutamatergic alterations.,"The excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is an important molecular pathological feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) as altered GABA and glutamate levels have been found in multiple brain regions in patients. Healthy subjects show topographic organization of the E/I balance (EIB) across various brain regions. We here raise the question of whether such EIB topography is altered in MDD. Therefore, we systematically review the gene and protein expressions of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic signaling-related molecules in postmortem MDD brain studies as proxies for EIB topography. Searches were conducted through PubMed and 45 research articles were finally included. We found: i) brain-wide GABA- and glutamatergic alterations; ii) attenuated GABAergic with enhanced glutamatergic signaling in the cortical-subcortical limbic system; iii) that GABAergic signaling is decreased in regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) while it is increased in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). These together demonstrate abnormal GABA- and glutamatergic signaling-based EIB topographies in MDD. This enhances our pathophysiological understanding of MDD and carries important therapeutic implications for stimulation treatment.",2023
"Glutamate plus glutamine to GABA ratio as a predictor of ketamine response in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, randomized, open-label extension study.","Approximately 30 % of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD.",2025
Alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate neurotransmission linked to intermittent theta-burst stimulation in depression: a sham-controlled study.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13) = 0.54, p = 0.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11) = 0.66, p = 0.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",2025
Lack of association between pretreatment glutamate/GABA and major depressive disorder treatment response.,"Studies have shown gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and Glx (a combination of glutamate and glutamine) to be altered in major depressive disorder (MDD). Using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), this study aimed to determine whether lower pretreatment GABA and Glx levels in the medial frontal cortex, a region implicated in MDD pathophysiology, are associated with better antidepressant treatment response. Participants with MDD (N = 74) were antidepressant naïve or medication-free for at least three weeks before imaging. Two MEGA-PRESS <sup>1</sup>H-MRS acquisitions were collected, interleaved with a water unsuppressed reference scan. GABA and Glx concentrations were quantified from an average difference spectrum, with preprocessing using Gannet and spectral fitting using TARQUIN. Following imaging, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied with treatment type and age as covariates. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing was used to interpret the strength of the evidence. No significant association was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA, or Glx/GABA and depression remission status or the continuous outcome, percent change in symptom severity. In an exploratory analysis, no significant correlation was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA or Glx/GABA and days to response. Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence towards the null hypotheses in all cases. To date, there are no replicated biomarkers in psychiatry. To address this, well-powered, placebo-controlled trials need to be undertaken and reported. The present analysis suggests pretreatment GABA, Glx, or their ratio cannot predict antidepressant treatment response. Future direction including examining glutamate and glutamine separately or examining biological subtypes of MDD separately.Trial Name: Advancing Personalized Antidepressant Treatment Using PET/MRI.Registration Number: NCT02623205 URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02623205.",2025
Decreased prefrontal glutamatergic function is associated with a reduced astrocyte-related gene expression in treatment-resistant depression.,"Glutamatergic dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, few physiological studies have evaluated its pathophysiology in vivo in individuals with TRD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) techniques can assess intracortical facilitation (ICF), which reflects glutamatergic neurophysiological function in specific cortical regions. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare glutamatergic receptor-mediated function as indexed with ICF TMS-EEG in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) between participants with TRD and healthy controls (HCs) and (2) to explore the relationships between cell-specific gene expression levels and the group difference in glutamatergic neural propagation using virtual histology approach. Sixty participants with TRD and thirty HCs were examined with ICF TMS-EEG measure (80 single-pulse TMS and paired-pulse ICF) in the left DLPFC. Both sensor and source-level ICF measures were computed to compare them between the TRD and HC groups. Furthermore, we conducted spatial correlation analyses interregionally between ICF glutamatergic activity and cell-specific gene expression levels employing the Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset. DLPFC-ICF at the sensor level was not significantly different between the two groups, whereas DLPFC-ICF at the source level was reduced in the TRD group compared with the HC group (p = 0.026). Moreover, the reduced ICF signal propagation of TRD correlated with astrocyte-specific gene expression level (p < 0.0001). The glutamatergic neural activities indexed by ICF in the left DLPFC were decreased in participants with TRD. Additionally, a relative reduction in glutamatergic signal propagation originating from the DLPFC in TRD may be associated with astrocytic abnormality.",2024
Quantification of Glutathione and Its Associated Spontaneous Neuronal Activity in Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial antioxidant in the human brain. Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy sequence is highly recommended, limited literature has measured cortical GSH using this method in major psychiatric disorders. By combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we quantified brain GSH and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus and explored relationships between GSH levels and intrinsic neuronal activity as well as clinical symptoms among healthy control (HC) participants (n = 30), people with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 28), and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n = 28). GSH concentrations were lower in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in both the MDD and OCD groups than in the HC group. In the HC group, positive correlations were noted between GSH and glutamate levels and between GSH and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in both regions. However, while these correlations were absent in both patient groups, there was a weak positive correlation between glutamate and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Moreover, GSH levels were negatively correlated with depressive and compulsive symptoms in MDD and OCD, respectively. These findings suggest that reduced GSH levels and an imbalance between GSH and glutamate could increase oxidative stress and alter neurotransmitter signaling, thereby leading to disruptions in GSH-related neurochemical-neuronal coupling and psychopathologies across MDD and OCD. Understanding these mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the processes that underlie these disorders and potentially become a springboard for future directions and advancing our knowledge of their neurobiological foundations.",2025
Novel insight into astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission modulates the synaptic plasticity in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a form of glial cell-based synaptic dysfunction disease in which glial cells interact closely with neuronal synapses and perform synaptic information processing. Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, are active components of the brain and are responsible for synaptic activity through the release gliotransmitters. A reduced density of astrocytes and astrocyte dysfunction have both been identified the brains of patients with MDD. Furthermore, gliotransmission, i.e., active information transfer mediated by gliotransmitters between astrocytes and neurons, is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. However, the mechanism by which astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission contributes to depression remains unknown. This review therefore summarizes the alterations in astrocytes in MDD, including astrocyte marker, connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, Cx43 gap junctions, and Cx43 hemichannels, and describes the regulatory mechanisms of astrocytes involved in synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms acting of the glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and purinergic systems that modulate synaptic function and the antidepressant mechanisms of the related receptor antagonists. Further, we summarize the roles of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, d-serine, and adenosine triphosphate in depression, providing a basis for the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for MDD.",2024
Glutamatergic Modulators for Major Depression from Theory to Clinical Use.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, burdensome, highly prevalent disease that is characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia. MDD is especially burdensome as approved monoamine antidepressant treatments have weeks-long delays before clinical benefit and low remission rates. In the past 2 decades, a promising target emerged to improve patient outcomes in depression treatment: glutamatergic signaling. This narrative review provides a high-level overview of glutamate signaling in synaptogenesis and neural plasticity and the implications of glutamate dysregulation in depression. Based on this preclinical evidence implicating glutamate in depression and the rapid improvement of depression with ketamine treatment in a proof-of-concept trial, a range of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-targeted therapies have been investigated. While an array of treatments has been investigated in registered phase 2 or 3 clinical trials, the development of most of these agents has been discontinued. Multiple glutamate-targeted antidepressants are actively in development, and two are approved. Nasal administration of esketamine (Spravato<sup>®</sup>) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression and in 2020 for adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. Oral combination dextromethorphan-bupropion (AXS-05, Auvelity<sup>®</sup> extended-release tablet) was FDA approved in 2022 for the treatment of MDD in adults. These approvals bolster the importance of glutamate in depression and represent an exciting breakthrough in contemporary psychiatry, providing new avenues of treatment for patients as first-line therapy or with either poor response or unacceptable side effects to monoaminergic antidepressants.",2024
"An Astroglial Basis of Major Depressive Disorder: Molecular, Cellular, and Circuit Features.","Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Astrocytes play a role in the maintenance of the function of the central nervous system, both physiologically and pathologically. Accumulated evidence indicates that the astrocyte is an important contributor to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder including blood-brain barrier integrity, gap junctions, gliotransmission, glutamate homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Here, we comprehensively summarize an astroglial basis for major depressive disorder based on molecular, cellular, and circuit properties, suggesting that astrocytes appear to be highly sensitive to stress and are likely to be uniquely positioned to integrate peripheral and central stress responses.",2025
Medial prefrontal cortex neurotransmitter abnormalities in posttraumatic stress disorder with and without comorbidity to major depression.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric condition that follows exposure to a traumatic stressor. Though previous in vivo proton (<sup>1</sup>H) MRS) research conducted at 4 T or lower has identified alterations in glutamate metabolism associated with PTSD predisposition and/or progression, no prior investigations have been conducted at higher field strength. In addition, earlier studies have not extensively addressed the impact of psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD) on PTSD-associated <sup>1</sup>H-MRS-visible brain metabolite abnormalities. Here we employ 7 T <sup>1</sup>H MRS to examine concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and glutathione in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of PTSD patients with MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD+</sub>; N = 6) or without MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD-</sub>; N = 5), as well as trauma-unmatched controls without PTSD but with MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD+</sub>; N = 9) or without MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub>; N = 18). Participants with PTSD demonstrated decreased ratios of GABA to glutamine relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls but no single-metabolite abnormalities. When comorbid MDD was considered, however, MDD but not PTSD diagnosis was significantly associated with increased mPFC glutamine concentration and decreased glutamate:glutamine ratio. In addition, all participants with PTSD and/or MDD collectively demonstrated decreased glutathione relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls. Despite limited findings in single metabolites, patterns of abnormality in prefrontal metabolite concentrations among individuals with PTSD and/or MDD enabled supervised classification to separate them from healthy controls with 80+% sensitivity and specificity, with glutathione, glutamine, and myoinositol consistently among the most informative metabolites for this classification. Our findings indicate that MDD can be an important factor in mPFC glutamate metabolism abnormalities observed using <sup>1</sup>H MRS in cohorts with PTSD.",2024
Planar cell polarity proteins mediate ketamine-induced restoration of glutamatergic synapses in prefrontal cortical neurons in a mouse model for chronic stress.,"Single administration of low-dose ketamine has both acute and sustained anti-depressant effects. Sustained effect is associated with restoration of glutamatergic synapses in medial prefrontal cortic (mFPC) neurons. Ketamine induced profound changes in a number of molecular pathways in a mouse model for chronic stress. Cell-cell communication analyses predicted that planar-cell-polarity (PCP) signaling was decreased after chronic administration of corticosterone but increased following ketamine administration in most of the excitatory neurons. Similar decrease of PCP signaling in excitatory neurons was predicted in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (dl-PFC) neurons of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). We showed that the basolateral amygdala (BLA)-projecting infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL PFC) neurons regulate immobility time in the tail suspension test and food consumption. Conditionally knocking out Celsr2 and Celsr3 or Prickle2 in the BLA-projecting IL PFC neurons abolished ketamine-induced synapse restoration and behavioral remission. Therefore, PCP proteins in IL PFC-BLA neurons mediate synapse restoration induced by of low-dose ketamine.",2024
The impact of matching for reproductive status on the comparison of magnetic spectroscopic measurements of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid + in the medial prefrontal cortex of women with major depression.,"The role played by medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the pathophysiology and the treatment of major depression (MD) is increasingly recognized. Although measurements of MPFC GABA and Glu have been shown to be sensitive to physiological fluctuations of female hormones, none of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) investigations of MPFC Glu and GABA in MD have controlled for possible bias effect of the reproductive stage of the women included. MPFC Glu and GABA+ (which include homocarnosine and macromolecules) referenced to creatine and phosphocreatine, were measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using a 3-Tesla magnet in 24 women with MD and 24 healthy women paired for reproductive status. All participants were unmedicated. There were no statistical differences in either MPFC Glu [95 % CI: (-0.025, 0.034)] or MPFC GABA+ [95 % CI: (-0.005, 0.017)] between women with MD and healthy controls. Our investigation does not support abnormalities in measurement of MPFC Glu and GABA in MD women when stringent control for reproductive status is performed. As a result of the inherent limitations of MRS methodology, our results do not preclude glutamatergic and GABAergic dysregulations in the MPFC of women with MD.",2024
"Dysfunction of neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the severity of depression in first-diagnosed, drug-naïve depressed patients.","Biochemical changes of neurotransmitters underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) are unknown. This study preliminarily explored the association between neurotransmitters with MDD and the possibility of objective laboratory prediction of neurotransmitter involvement in MDD. A total of 87 first-diagnosed, drug-naïve patients with depression and 50 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the cross-sectional study. The levels and turnovers of neurotransmitters (glutamine (GLN), glutamic acid (GLU), γ-2Aminobutiric acid (GABA), kainate (KA), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), 3-methoxy 4-hydroxyphenyl ethylene glycol (MHPG), noradrenaline (NE), homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), dopamine (DA), tryptophane (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) were determined and the confounding factors were adjusted. Then a correlation and a predictive analysis towards neurotransmitters for MDD were performed. After adjusting confounding factors, GLU (OR = 1.159), (GLU+ GABA)/GLN (OR = 1.217), DOPAC (OR = 1.106), DOPAC/DA (OR = 1.089) and (DOPAC+ HVA)/DA (OR = 1.026) enacted as risk factors of MDD, while KYN (OR = 0.992) was a protective factor. GABAergic and TRPergic pathways were associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with depression. The predictive model for MDD (AUC = 0.775, 95%CI 0.683-0.860) consisted of KYN (OR = 0.990) and (GLU + GABA)/GLN (OR = 4.101). First-diagnosed, drug-naïve depression patients showed abnormal neurotransmitter composition. GLU, (GLU + GABA)/GLN, DOPAC, DOPAC/DA and (DOPAC + HVA)/DA were risk factors of MDD, while KYN was a protective factor. GABAergic and TRPergic pathways were correlated with MDD clinical characteristics. KYN and (GLU + GABA)/GLN may have a predictive value for MDD.",2024
"Cortical glutamate, Glx, and total N-acetylaspartate: potential biomarkers of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment response and outcomes in major depression.","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have not improved with standard therapies. However, only 30-45% of patients respond to rTMS. Predicting response to rTMS will benefit both patients and providers in terms of prescribing and targeting treatment for maximum efficacy and directing resources, as individuals with lower likelihood of response could be redirected to more suitable treatment alternatives. In this exploratory study, our goal was to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine how glutamate (Glu), Glx, and total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) predict post-rTMS changes in overall MDD severity and symptoms, and treatment response. Metabolites were measured in a right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex voxel prior to a standard course of 10 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC in 25 individuals with MDD. MDD severity and symptoms were evaluated via the Inventory of Depression Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR). rTMS response was defined as ≥50% change in full-scale IDS-SR scores post treatment. Percent change in IDS-SR symptom domains were evaluated using principal component analysis and established subscales. Generalized linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between baseline Glu, Glx, and tNAA and outcomes while controlling for age and sex. Participants with baseline Glu and Glx levels in the lower range had greater percent change in full scale IDS-SR scores post-treatment (p < 0.001), as did tNAA (p = 0.007). Low glutamatergic metabolite levels also predicted greater percent change in mood/cognition symptoms (p ≤ 0.001). Low-range Glu, Glx, and tNAA were associated with greater improvement on the immuno-metabolic subscale (p ≤ 0.003). Baseline Glu predicted rTMS responder status (p = 0.025) and had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (p = 0.009), demonstrating excellent discriminative ability. Baseline Glu, Glx, and tNAA significantly predicted MDD improvement after rTMS; preliminary evidence also demonstrates metabolite association with symptom subdomain improvement post-rTMS. This work provides feasibility for a personalized medicine approach to rTMS treatment selection, with individuals with Glu levels in the lower range potentially being the best candidates.",2024
The mechanistic basis for the rapid antidepressant-like effects of ketamine: From neural circuits to molecular pathways.,"Conventional antidepressants that target monoaminergic receptors require several weeks to be efficacious. This lag represents a significant problem in the currently available treatments for serious depression. Ketamine, acting as an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, was shown to have rapid antidepressant-like effects, marking a significant advancement in the study of mood disorders. However, serious side effects and adverse reactions limit its clinical use. Considering the limitations of ketamine, it is crucial to further define the network targets of ketamine. The rapid action of ketamine an as antidepressant is thought to be mediated by the glutamate system. It is believed that synaptic plasticity is essential for the rapid effects of ketamine as an antidepressant. Other mechanisms include the involvement of the γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic), 5-HTergic systems, and recent studies have linked astrocytes to ketamine's rapid antidepressant-like effects. The interactions between these systems exert a synergistic rapid antidepressant effect through neural circuits and molecular mechanisms. Here, we discuss the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms underlying the action of ketamine. This work will help explain how molecular and neural targets are responsible for the effects of rapidly acting antidepressants and will aid in the discovery of new therapeutic approaches for major depressive disorder.",2024
[Ketamine: a neuropsychotropic drug with an innovative mechanism of action].,"Ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-glutamate receptor (R-NMDA), has a rapid (from 24 h post-dose) and prolonged (up to one week) antidepressant effect in treatment resistant depression and in rodent models of anxiety/depression. Arguments regarding its cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant activity mainly come from animal studies. However, debates still persist on the structural remodeling of frontocortical/hippocampal neurons and the role of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters involved in its behavioral effect. Neurochemical and behavioral changes are maintained 24 h after administration of ketamine, well beyond its plasma elimination half-life. The glutamatergic pyramidal cells of the medial prefrontal cortex are primarily implicated in the therapeutic effects of ketamine. Advances in knowledge of the consequences of R-NMDA blockade allowed to specify the underlying mechanisms involving the activation of AMPA glutamate receptors, which triggers a cascade of intracellular events dependent on the mechanistic target of rapamycin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and synaptic protein synthesis facilitating synaptic plasticity (number of dendritic spines, synaptogenesis). This review focuses on abnormalities of neurotransmitter systems involved in major depressive disorders, their potential impact on neural circuitry and beneficial effects of ketamine. Recent preclinical data pave the way for future studies to better clarify the mechanism of action of fast-acting antidepressant drugs for the development of novel, more effective therapies.",2023
The Importance of α-Klotho in Depression and Cognitive Impairment and Its Connection to Glutamate Neurotransmission-An Up-to-Date Review.,"Depression is a serious neuropsychiatric disease affecting an increasing number of people worldwide. Cognitive deficits (including inattention, poor memory, and decision-making difficulties) are common in the clinical picture of depression. Cognitive impairment has been hypothesized to be one of the most important components of major depressive disorder (MDD; referred to as clinical depression), although typical cognitive symptoms are less frequent in people with depression than in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD; sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder). The importance of α-Klotho in the aging process has been well-documented. Growing evidence points to the role of α-Klotho in regulating other biological functions, including responses to oxidative stress and the modulation of synaptic plasticity. It has been proven that a Klotho deficit may contribute to the development of various nervous system pathologies, such as behavioral disorders or neurodegeneration. Given the growing evidence of the role of α-Klotho in depression and cognitive impairment, it is assumed that this protein may be a molecular link between them. Here, we provide a research review of the role of α-Klotho in depression and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we propose potential mechanisms (related to oxidative stress and glutamatergic transmission) that may be important in α-Klotho-mediated regulation of mental and cognitive function.",2023
Neurometabolite changes in response to antidepressant medication: A systematic review of <sup>1</sup>H-MRS findings.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and (es)ketamine are used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD). These different types of medication may involve common neural pathways related to glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems, both of which have been implicated in MDD pathology. We conducted a systematic review of pharmacological proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) studies in healthy volunteers and individuals with MDD to explore the potential impact of these medications on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Embase and included randomized controlled trials or cohort studies, which assessed the effects of SSRIs, SNRIs, or (es)ketamine on glutamate, glutamine, Glx or GABA using single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI). Additionally, studies were included when they used a field strength > 1.5 T, and when a comparison of metabolite levels between antidepressant treatment and placebo or baseline with post-medication metabolite levels was done. We excluded animal studies, duplicate publications, or articles with <sup>1</sup>H-MRS data already described in another included article. Twenty-nine studies were included in this review. Fifteen studies investigated the effect of administration or treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs, and fourteen studies investigated the effect of (es)ketamine on glutamatergic and GABAergic metabolite levels. Studies on SSRIs and SNRIs were highly variable, generally underpowered, and yielded no consistent findings across brain regions or specific populations. Although studies on (es)ketamine were also highly variable, some demonstrated an increase in glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex in a time-dependent manner after administration. Our findings highlight the need for standardized study and acquisition protocols. Additionally, measuring metabolites dynamically over time or combining <sup>1</sup>H-MRS with whole brain functional imaging techniques could provide valuable insights into the effects of these medications on glutamate and GABAergic neurometabolism.",2023
Folate and Its Significance in Depressive Disorders and Suicidality: A Comprehensive Narrative Review.,"Depressive disorders pose significant challenges to global public health, necessitating effective prevention and management strategies. Notably, the occurrence of suicide frequently coincides with depressive episodes. Suicide is as a paramount global health concern that demands efficacious preventive strategies. Current psychiatric approaches heavily rely on pharmacological interventions but have had limited success in addressing the global burden of mental health issues. Suboptimal nutrition, with its impact on the neuroendocrine system, has been implicated in the underlying pathology of depressive disorders. Folate, a group of water-soluble compounds, plays a crucial role in various central nervous system functions. Depressed individuals often exhibit low levels of serum and red blood cell folate. Multiple studies and systematic reviews have investigated the efficacy of folic acid and its derivative, L-methylfolate, which can cross the blood-brain barrier, as stand-alone or adjunct therapies for depression. Although findings have been mixed, the available evidence generally supports the use of these compounds in depressed individuals. Recent studies have established links between the one-carbon cycle, folate-homocysteine balance, immune system function, glutamate excitation via NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and gut microbiome eubiosis in mood regulation. These findings provide insights into the complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of folate and related compounds in depression. Through a comprehensive review of the existing literature, this study aims to advance our understanding of the therapeutic potential of folic acid and related compounds in depression treatment. It also seeks to explore their role in addressing suicidal tendencies and shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms involved, leveraging the latest discoveries in depression research.",2023
Brain-wide changes in excitation-inhibition balance of major depressive disorder: a systematic review of topographic patterns of GABA- and glutamatergic alterations.,"The excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is an important molecular pathological feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) as altered GABA and glutamate levels have been found in multiple brain regions in patients. Healthy subjects show topographic organization of the E/I balance (EIB) across various brain regions. We here raise the question of whether such EIB topography is altered in MDD. Therefore, we systematically review the gene and protein expressions of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic signaling-related molecules in postmortem MDD brain studies as proxies for EIB topography. Searches were conducted through PubMed and 45 research articles were finally included. We found: i) brain-wide GABA- and glutamatergic alterations; ii) attenuated GABAergic with enhanced glutamatergic signaling in the cortical-subcortical limbic system; iii) that GABAergic signaling is decreased in regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) while it is increased in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). These together demonstrate abnormal GABA- and glutamatergic signaling-based EIB topographies in MDD. This enhances our pathophysiological understanding of MDD and carries important therapeutic implications for stimulation treatment.",2023
Effects of Psychotherapy on Glutamatergic Neurotransmission.,"Psychodynamic psychotherapy is an effective and widely used treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD); however, little is known about neurobiological changes associated with induced symptom improvement. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with a two-dimensional J-resolved sequence served to test the relationship between glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) levels, measured separately in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) as a control region, with change in depression symptoms after 6 months of weekly psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions in MDD patients. Depressed (N = 45) and healthy (N = 30) subjects participated in a baseline proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement and a subgroup of MDD subjects (N = 21) then received once-a-week psychodynamic psychotherapy and participated in a second proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement after 6 months. Change in depression symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Higher pretreatment pgACC Gln concentrations in MDD patients compared to healthy controls were associated with symptom severity. Patients and controls did not differ regarding Gln levels in aMCC nor regarding Glu levels in both regions. The association of pgACC Gln concentration and severity of depressive symptoms was reversed after 6 months of psychotherapy in MDD subjects. Regarding Gln in aMCC as well as Glu in both regions, there were no significant associations with improvement of depressive symptoms in the course of psychotherapy. Findings indicate specific regional effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy on glutamatergic neurotransmission and thereby highlight the key role of the pgACC in both depression pathophysiology and recovery.",2023
Brain metabolic derangements examined using <sup>1</sup>H MRS and their (in)consistency among different rodent models of depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is underlined by neurochemical changes in the brain. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS) is a useful tool for their examination as it provides information about the levels of metabolites. This review summarises the current knowledge of <sup>1</sup>H MRS findings from rodent models of MDD, assesses the results from both a biological and a technical perspective, and identifies the main sources of bias. From a technical point of view, bias-introducing factors are the diversity of the measured volumes and their positioning in the brain, the data processing, and the metabolite concentration expression. The biological variables are strain, sex, and species, as well as the model itself, and in vivo vs. ex vivo exploration. This review identified some consistency in the <sup>1</sup>H MRS findings in the models of MDD: lower levels of glutamine, glutamate + glutamine, and higher levels of myo-inositol and taurine in most of the brain regions of MDD models. This may suggest changes in regional metabolism, neuronal dysregulation, inflammation, and a compensatory effect reaction in the MDD rodent models.",2023
"Intrahippocampal injection of a selective blocker of NMDA receptors containing the GluN2B subunit, Ro25-6981, increases glutamate neurotransmission and induces antidepressant-like effects.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious public health problem, as it is the most common psychiatric disorder worldwide. Antidepressant drugs increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is required to induce some behavioral effects of antidepressants. Adult-born granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and the glutamate receptors subunits 2 (GluN2B) subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ionotropic receptors play an important role in these effects. However, the precise neurochemical role of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor on adult-born GCs for antidepressant-like effects has yet to be elucidated. The present study aims to explore the contribution of the GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) to the antidepressant drug treatment using a pharmacological approach. Thus, (αR)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-(βS)-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol (Ro25-6981), a selective antagonist of the GluN2B subunit, was acutely administered locally into the ventral DG (vDG, 1 μg each side) following a chronic fluoxetine (18 mg/kg/day) treatment-known to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis-in a mouse model of anxiety/depression. Responses in a neurogenesis-dependent task, the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), and neurochemical consequences on extracellular glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the vDG were measured. Here, we show a rapid-acting antidepressant-like effect of local Ro25-6981 administration in the NSF independent of fluoxetine treatment. Furthermore, we revealed a fluoxetine-independent increase in the glutamatergic transmission in the vDG. Our results suggest behavioral and neurochemical effects of GluN2B subunit independent of serotonin reuptake inhibition.",2023
Understanding Lamotrigine's Role in the CNS and Possible Future Evolution.,"The anti-epileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) has been widely used to treat various neurological disorders, including epilepsy and bipolar disorder. However, its precise mechanism of action in the central nervous system (CNS) still needs to be determined. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of LTG in modulating the activity of voltage-gated ion channels, particularly those related to the inhibition of neuronal excitability. Additionally, LTG has been found to have neuroprotective effects, potentially through the inhibition of glutamate release and the enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. LTG's unique mechanism of action compared to other anti-epileptic drugs has led to the investigation of its use in treating other CNS disorders, such as neuropathic pain, PTSD, and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, the drug has been combined with other anti-epileptic drugs and mood stabilizers, which may enhance its therapeutic effects. In conclusion, LTG's potential to modulate multiple neurotransmitters and ion channels in the CNS makes it a promising drug for treating various neurological disorders. As our understanding of its mechanism of action in the CNS continues to evolve, the potential for the drug to be used in new indications will also be explored.",2023
Glutamate shall not pass: a mechanistic role for astrocytic O-GlcNAc transferase in stress and depression.,"Major depressive disorder, characterized by aberrant glutamatergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Depression is highly comorbid with metabolic disorders, but a mechanistic link is elusive. In this issue of the JCI, Fan and coauthors report that elevated posttranslational modification with the glucose metabolite N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) contributed to stress-induced establishment of depression-like behaviors in mice. This effect was specific to medial PFC (mPFC) astrocytes, with glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) identified as an OGT target. Specifically, O-GlcNAcylation of GLT-1 resulted in diminished glutamate clearance from excitatory synapses. Further, astrocytic OGT knockdown restored stress-induced deficits in glutamatergic signaling, promoting resilience. These findings provide a mechanistic link between metabolism and depression and have relevance for antidepressant targets.",2023
The roles of neuroinflammation and glutamatergic excitotoxicity in treatment-resistant depression.,"Major depressive disorder affects nearly 20% of people during their lifetime. A growing body of evidence supports the theory that neuroinflammation plays a prominent role in the neurobiology of depression, which implicates glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid as key factors in the pathophysiology of the disease process. This article reviews the pathologic pathways of glutamate excess in the central nervous system and how they may be implicated in the underlying disorder of treatment-resistant depression and targeted for treatment.",2023
Allostatic Load and Metabolic Syndrome in Depressed Patients: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.,"Allostatic load (AL) is the cumulative wear and tear on the body due to the chronic adverse physical or psychosocial situations. The acute stress response activates the primary mediators of AL, which include cortisol, epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). Secondary outcomes, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), cardiovascular, and immune system changes, can result from long-term stress responses. Given these complex reactions to an acute stressor, a multidimensional stress assessment is required when investigating individual stress reactivity in an experimental setting. This study is aimed at examining the association between the primary mediators of AL and MetS in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. MDD patients (<i>n</i> = 164, age = 18-65 years old) with MetS+ (<i>n</i> = 46, weight = 93.10 ± 16.43 kg) and without MetS- (<i>n</i> = 118, weight = 73.08 ± 15.22 kg) were analyzed cross-sectionally. Stepwise binary regression and Welch's <i>t</i>-test were used to find the associations and differences between the two groups. The regression analysis was fully adjusted for age, sex, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II score. In unadjusted model, cortisol (<i>b</i> = -0.003, <i>p</i> = 0.034) was inversely associated with MetS. In fully adjusted model, EPI (<i>b</i> = -0.006, <i>p</i> = 0.007) was inversely associated with MetS. However, significant differences (<i>p</i> = 0.005) were observed for cortisol between MDD patients without MetS- (410.13 ± 144.63 nmol/l) and MDD patients with MetS+ (340.90 ± 132.98 nmol/l) with a small effect size (Cohen's <i>d</i> of 0.489). Significant differences (<i>p</i> = 0.001) were observed for EPI between MDD patients without MetS- (185.67 ± 124.44 pg/ml) and MDD patients with MetS+ (124.95 ± 84.38 pg/ml) with a moderate effect size (Cohen's <i>d</i> of 0.530). These observations are of clinical importance for the management of MDD patients.",2024
Major depressive disorder on a neuromorphic continuum.,"The heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) has hindered clinical translation and neuromarker identification. Biotyping facilitates solving the problems of heterogeneity, by dissecting MDD patients into discrete subgroups. However, interindividual variations suggest that depression may be conceptualized as a ""continuum,"" rather than as a ""category."" We use a Bayesian model to decompose structural MRI features of MDD patients from a multisite cross-sectional cohort into three latent disease factors (spatial pattern) and continuum factor compositions (individual expression). The disease factors are associated with distinct neurotransmitter receptors/transporters obtained from open PET sources. Increases cortical thickness in sensory and decreases in orbitofrontal cortices (Factor 1) associate with norepinephrine and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> density, decreases in the cingulo-opercular network and subcortex (Factor 2) associate with norepinephrine and 5-HTT density, and increases in social and affective brain systems (Factor 3) relate to 5-HTT density. Disease factor patterns can also be used to predict depressive symptom improvement in patients from the longitudinal cohort. Moreover, individual factor expressions in MDD are stable over time in a longitudinal cohort, with differentially expressed disease controls from a transdiagnostic cohort. Collectively, our data-driven disease factors reveal that patients with MDD organize along continuous dimensions that affect distinct sets of regions.",2025
"Dysregulation of Noradrenergic Activity: Its Role in Conceptualizing and Treating Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia, Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.","When discussing neurotransmitters whose signaling plays an important role in psychiatric illnesses, serotonin and dopamine may be the first that come to mind. Although serotonin and dopamine have significant roles, the impact of norepinephrine signaling is often overlooked. A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperactivity of norepinephrine signaling is an underlying issue in psychiatric disorders; conversely, there is evidence to suggest that deficits in the noradrenergic system are just as significant. Hence, alterations in noradrenergic activity are better characterized as dysregulation rather than a reductive, outdated formulation of ""too much"" or ""too little"" activity. Therefore, symptoms such as agitation, irritability, hyperarousal, and insomnia could be treated by targeting the underlying pathophysiology related to noradrenergic dysregulation with targeted treatments. In a recent consensus panel meeting, 5 experts reviewed the available evidence of altered noradrenergic activity and its potential role in some of the most common psychiatric disorders. This Academic Highlights article summarizes their discussion and presents the panel's conclusions.",2024
Role of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system in stress-related psychopathology and resilience: Clinical and pre-clinical evidences.,"Stressful events, from daily stressors to traumatic experiences, are common and occur at any age. Despite the high prevalence of trauma, not everyone develops stress-related disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a variation attributed to resilience, the ability to adapt and avoid negative consequences of significant stress. This review examines the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a critical component in the brain's stress response. It discusses the LC-NE system's anatomical and functional complexity and its role in individual variability in stress responses. How different etiological factors and stress modalities affect the LC-NE system, influencing both adaptive stress responses and psychopathologies, are discussed and supported by evidence from human and animal studies. It also explores molecular and cellular adaptations in the LC that contribute to resilience, including roles of neuropeptide, inflammatory cytokines, and genetic modulation, and addresses developmental and sex differences in stress vulnerability. The need for a multifaceted approach to understand stress-induced psychopathologies is emphasized and pave the way for more personalized interventions for stress-related disorders.",2024
Effect of esketamine on serum neurotransmitters in patients with postpartum depression: a randomized controlled trial.,"The development of postpartum depression has been linked to fluctuations in the levels of neurotransmitters in the human body, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (Norepinephrine, NE), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research has indicated that the antidepressant effect of esketamine are mediated by monoamine transmitters and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we postulate that intravenous administration of esketamine in patients with postpartum depression may alter the serum concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Three hundred fifteen patients with postpartum depression were selected and divided into two groups based on randomized numerical expression: esketamine (E) group (0. 25 mg/kg esketamine) and control (C) group (a same volume of 0.9% saline), all the drugs were pumped for 40 min. After the end of drug pumping, all patients were continuously observed for 2 h. Changes in serum levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, BDNF were recorded before drug administration and on the 3rd day after drug administration. The scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were calculated before drug administration, and on the 3rd day and on the 30th day after drug administration. Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and feeling of detachment occurred were recorded within 2 h after drug administration. Before drug administration, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (0. 91 ± 0. 19 vs. 0. 98 ± 0. 21, P = 0. 181), (2. 38 ± 0. 35 vs. 2. 32 ± 0. 32, P = 0. 491), (3. 07 ± 0. 89 vs 3. 02 ± 0. 88, P = 0. 828), (39. 79 ± 7. 78 vs 41. 34 ± 10. 03, P = 0. 506). On the third day post-medication, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (1. 42 ± 0. 35 vs. 0. 96 ± 0. 24, P < 0. 001), (3. 99 ± 0. 17 vs. 2. 41 ± 0. 28, P < 0. 001),(5. 45 ± 0. 81 vs 3. 22 ± 0. 76, P < 0. 001),(44. 36 ± 9. 98 vs 40. 69 ± 11. 75, P = 0. 198). Before medication, the EPDS scores were (16. 15 ± 3. 02 vs 17. 85 ± 3. 89, P = 0. 064). on the third day after medication, the Group E had significantly reduced scores (12. 98 ± 2. 39 vs 16. 73 ± 3. 52, P < 0. 001). On the 30rd day after medication, EPDS scores between the two groups were (16. 34 ± 3. 43 vs 16. 91 ± 4. 02, p = 0. 203). Within 2 h of medication, the rate of adverse events was similar between the two groups.

Genetically encoded sensors for in vivo detection of neurochemicals relevant to depression.,"Depressive disorders are a common and debilitating form of mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying causes and mechanisms of depressive disorders are still poorly understood. Neurochemical systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, have been implicated in the development and perpetuation of depressive symptoms. Current treatments for depression target these neuromodulator systems, but there is a need for a better understanding of their role in order to develop more effective treatments. Monitoring neurochemical dynamics during depressive symptoms is crucial for gaining a better a understanding of their involvement in depressive disorders. Genetically encoded sensors have emerged recently that offer high spatial-temporal resolution and the ability to monitor neurochemical dynamics in real time. This review explores the neurochemical systems involved in depression and discusses the applications and limitations of current monitoring tools for neurochemical dynamics. It also highlights the potential of genetically encoded sensors for better characterizing neurochemical dynamics in depression-related behaviors. Furthermore, potential improvements to current sensors are discussed in order to meet the requirements of depression research.",2024
"Effect of esketamine on postpartum depression after labor analgesia and potential mechanisms: a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial.","To evaluate the effect of esketamine combined with ropivacaine hydrochloride on the occurrence of postpartum depression (PPD) after labor analgesia under epidural analgesia pump and explore the possible mechanisms. A total of 120 women aged 24 to 36 years old who underwent labor analgesia by epidural analgesia pump, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status II were enrolled. According to the formula of epidural analgesia pump, all participants were randomly divided into two groups: esketamine group (Group E) and control group (Group C). Epidural anaesthesia were operated in all women between L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> after cervical dilation up to 2 ~ 3 cm. After successful puncture, the epidural catheter was placed 3.5 cm toward the head and 1% lidocaine was injected for 3 ml. The epidural analgesia pump was connected. Esketamine (0.2 mg/kg) combined with 0.75% ropivacaine hydrochloride (20 ml) were diluted by normal saline up to 100 ml in Group E, when only the equal dose of ropivacaine hydrochloride was used in Group C. The visual analogue scale (VAS) before analgesia (T<sub>1</sub>), 5 (T<sub>2</sub>), 10 (T<sub>3</sub>) and 20 (T<sub>4</sub>) minutes after analgesia were measured. The duration of the first and second stage of labor, the Apgar score of fetus at delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, consumption of esketamine and ropivacaine were recorded. The incidence of PPD was recorded at 1 week and 6 weeks after delivering. The occurrence of side effects such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and nightmares were also recorded for 48 h after delivering. The levels of leptin, norepinephrine(NE), and epinephrine(E) in the peripheral venous blood were measured before labor analgesia and at 24 h, 1 week, and 6 weeks after delivering. Compared with Group C, the VAS score at T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> were significantly lower in Group E (P < 0.01). Compared with Group C, the incidence of PPD was significantly lower at 1 week and 6 weeks after delivering in Group E (P < 0.01). Compared with Group C, the levels of leptin were significantly higher at 24 h and 1 week after delivering in Group E (P < 0.01), while NE and E (P < 0.01) were lower at the same time (P < 0.01). There were no significant difference of the duration of the first and second stage of labor, the Apgar score of fetus at delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, consumption of ropivacaine and the side effects for 48 h after delivering between the two groups. Esketamine combined with ropivacaine hydrochloride used in labor analgesia can significantly reduce the incidence of postpartum depression after delivering without increasing related side effects, which may be related to the regulation of leptin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the serum.

Association of serotonin reuptake inhibitors with asthma control.,"<b>Background:</b> Clinical trials demonstrated that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can improve asthma control in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and that this effect may be greater than the effect of SSRIs on depression. These findings suggest that SSRIs may improve asthma control in patients without MDD. <b>Objective:</b> The current retrospective study examined the effect of SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) on asthma control in adult patients. We hypothesized that patients would have fewer asthma exacerbations after treatment with an SSRI or SNRI. <b>Methods:</b> Electronic health record data of adult patients (N = 592) who were seen at a University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) hospital or clinic and had (1) an SSRI or SNRI prescription, (2) a previous asthma diagnosis, and (3) no mood disorder diagnosis were extracted by using the UTSW Clinical Data Exchange Network. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare oral corticosteroid prescriptions and asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in the 12 months before and after the start of an SSRI/SNRI. <b>Results:</b> Therapy with SSRIs/SNRIs was associated with a significant decrease in oral corticosteroid use (p = 0.003), ED visits (p = 0.002), and hospitalizations (p < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Results from the current study add to the existing literature by demonstrating a reduced rate of severe exacerbations in patients with asthma by using an SSRI/SNRI without limiting the analytic sample to a high-illness-severity subgroup defined by symptoms of asthma or depression. Future work should include a prospective, placebo controlled study with individuals who have asthma and no comorbid mental health condition, verified by a mental health professional.",2023
Moving from serotonin to serotonin-norepinephrine enhancement with increasing venlafaxine dose: clinical implications and strategies for a successful outcome in major depressive disorder.,"Mental health disorders, especially depressive and anxiety disorders, are associated with substantial health-related burden. While the second-generation antidepressants are widely accepted as first-line pharmacological treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), patient response to such treatment is variable, with more than half failing to achieve complete remission, and residual symptoms are frequently present. Here, the pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine XR are reviewed in relation to its role as both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and we look at how these pharmacodynamic properties can be harnessed to guide clinical practice, asking the question 'is it possible to develop a symptom-cluster-based approach to the treatment of MDD with comorbid anxiety utilizing venlafaxine XR?.' Additionally, three illustrative clinical cases provide practical examples of the utility of venlafaxine-XR in real-world clinical practice. The place of venlafaxine XR in managing fatigue/low energy, a frequent residual symptom in MDD, is explored using pooled data from clinical trials of venlafaxine XR. Venlafaxine XR should be considered as a first-line treatment for MDD with or without comorbid anxiety, and there are clear pharmacodynamic signals supporting a symptom cluster-based treatment paradigm for venlafaxine XR.",2023
Real-world characteristics of European patients receiving SNRIs as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder.,"Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are among the most frequently prescribed antidepressants (ADs) for major depressive disorder (MDD), with an increasing trend in the last decade. Given the relative dearth of information regarding rationales for their preferred use as first-line ADs in the broad clinical routine, the present study systematically investigated real-world characteristics of MDD patients prescribed either SNRIs or other AD substances across different countries and treatment settings. In the present secondary analyses based on a large European, multi-site, naturalistic and cross-sectional investigation with a retrospective assessment of treatment outcome, we firstly defined the proportion of MDD patients receiving SNRIs as first-line AD psychopharmacotherapy and secondly compared their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to those patients prescribed alternative first-line ADs during their current major depressive episode (MDE). Within the total sample of 1410 MDD patients, 336 (23.8 %) received first-line SNRIs. Compared to other ADs, SNRIs were significantly associated with inpatient care, suicidality and treatment resistance during the current MDE, and a longer lifetime duration of psychiatric hospitalizations. Moreover, greater severity of depressive symptoms at study entry, higher daily doses of the administered ADs, as well as more frequent prescriptions of psychopharmacotherapeutic add-on strategies in general and antipsychotic augmentation in particular, were significantly related to first-line SNRIs. Considering the limitations of a cross-sectional and retrospective study design, our data point towards a preferred use of first-line SNRIs in a generally more severely ill MDD patients, although they did not lead to superior treatment outcomes compared to alternative ADs.",2023
Linking individual variability in functional brain connectivity to polygenic risk in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous disease, which brings great difficulties to clinical diagnosis and therapy. Its mechanism is still unknown. Prior neuroimaging studies mainly focused on mean differences between patients and healthy controls (HC), largely ignoring individual differences between patients. This study included 112 MDD patients and 93 HC subjects. Resting-state functional MRI data were obtained to examine the patterns of individual variability of brain functional connectivity (IVFC). The genetic risk of pathways including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and synaptic plasticity was assessed by multilocus genetic profile scores (MGPS), respectively. The IVFC pattern of the MDD group was similar but higher than that in HCs. The inter-network functional connectivity in the default mode network contributed to altered IVFC in MDD. 5-HT, NE, and HPA pathway genes affected IVFC in MDD patients. The age of onset, duration, severity, and treatment response, were correlated with IVFC. IVFC in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex had a mediating effect between MGPS of the 5-HT pathway and baseline depression severity. Environmental factors and differences in locations of functional areas across individuals were not taken into account. This study found MDD patients had significantly different inter-individual functional connectivity variations than healthy people, and genetic risk might affect clinical manifestations through brain function heterogeneity.",2023
Bupropion XL unapproved use in the prisons: Two cases focused on the bupropion pharmacology.,"Bupropion (BUP) is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor frequently used in prisons. Although its positive effects on depression treatment are often presented, there are many questions about its approved use in prisons and similar facilities. In this context, this article aims to present two case reports of BUP XL unapproved use and a review of the mechanism of action, formulations, and the clinical profile of BUP. Two case reports. The patients' data for the case reports were obtained from their medical records. A PubMed search was conducted using the terms BUP, inmates, and efficacy to identify randomized and non-randomized controlled trials and case reports to evaluate the possible effects of BUP in prison settings. Only approved medications were included. The positive effects of BUP XL on major depressive disorder treatment are well-reported, but few reports are on the pharmacokinetics of BUP XL in prisons. The exact mechanism of its effect on the central nervous system is predominantly connected with its unique pharmacokinetics. This paper shows that BUP XL will continue to play an essential role in treating a major depressive disorder in adults in prisons and other related disorders, although a different treatment strategy should be preferred in patients with high addictive potential. Because of a similar mechanism of action, the most appropriate alternatives for BUP XL could be mirtazapine, agomelatine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine, although clinical trials are needed to confirm these alternatives.",2022
Attempting to Increase the Effectiveness of the Antidepressant Trazodone Hydrochloride Drug Using π-Acceptors.,"Major depressive disorder is a prevalent mood illness that is mildly heritable. Cases with the highest familial risk had recurrence and onset at a young age. Trazodone hydrochloride is an antidepressant medicine that affects the chemical messengers in the brain known as neurotransmitters, which include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. In the present research, in solid and liquid phases, the 1:1 charge-transfer complexes between trazodone hydrochloride (TZD) and six different π-acceptors were synthesized and investigated using different microscopic techniques. The relation of dative ion pairs [TZD+, A-], where A is the acceptor, was inferred via intermolecular charge-transfer complexes. Additionally, a molecular docking examination was utilized to compare the interactions of protein receptors (serotonin-6BQH) with the TZD alone or in combination with the six distinct acceptor charge-transfer complexes. To refine the docking results acquired from AutoDock Vina and to better examine the molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions, a 100 ns run of molecular dynamics simulation was used. All the results obtained in this study prove that the 2,6-dichloroquinone-4-chloroimide (DCQ)/TZD complex interacts with serotonin receptors more efficiently than reactant donor TZD only and that [(TZD)(DCQ)]-serotonin has the highest binding energy value of all π-acceptor complexes.",2022
Noradrenaline activation of hippocampal dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors promotes antidepressant effects.,"Dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors (D<sub>1</sub>Rs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are essential for antidepressant effects. However, the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, the major source of dopamine in the brain, only sparsely project to DG, suggesting possible activation of DG D<sub>1</sub>Rs by endogenous substances other than dopamine. We have examined this possibility using electrophysiological and biochemical techniques and found robust activation of D<sub>1</sub>Rs in mouse DG neurons by noradrenaline. Noradrenaline at the micromolar range potentiated synaptic transmission at the DG output and increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase A substrates in DG via activation of D<sub>1</sub>Rs and β adrenergic receptors. Neuronal excitation preferentially enhanced noradrenaline-induced synaptic potentiation mediated by D<sub>1</sub>Rs with minor effects on β-receptor-dependent potentiation. Increased voluntary exercise by wheel running also enhanced noradrenaline-induced, D<sub>1</sub>R-mediated synaptic potentiation, suggesting a distinct functional role of the noradrenaline-D<sub>1</sub>R signaling. We then examined the role of this signaling in antidepressant effects using mice exposed to chronic restraint stress. In the stressed mice, an antidepressant acting on the noradrenergic system induced a mature-to-immature change in the DG neuron phenotype, a previously proposed cellular substrate for antidepressant action. This effect was evident only in mice subjected to wheel running and blocked by a D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist. These results suggest a critical role of noradrenaline-induced activation of D<sub>1</sub>Rs in antidepressant effects in DG. Experience-dependent regulation of noradrenaline-D<sub>1</sub>R signaling may determine responsiveness to antidepressant drugs in depressive disorders.",2022
Retinal markers of therapeutic responses in major depressive disorder: Effects of antidepressants on retinal function.,"One goal of research into major depressive disorder (MDD) is to develop markers to predict and monitor the response to psychotropic treatments. The retina is endowed with a complex neurotransmission system, composed of the main neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. The retina is therefore a relevant site of investigation for the identification of reliable and robust markers. However, the effects of antidepressants on the human retina are poorly studied. Here, we seek to study the potential specific effects of various antidepressants on retinal function in MDD patients. We assessed retinal function using flash (fERG), pattern (PERG) and multifocal (mfERG) electroretinogram in 19 MDD patients treated using antidepressants at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 and 12. We observed reduced b-wave amplitude of photopic fERG 3.0 in patients treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in comparison with patients treated with Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCAD). We also showed that SNRIs were associated both with a decrease in PERG P50 implicit time and an increase in fERG 3.0 b-wave amplitude. TCADs were associated with an increase in fERG flicker 3.0 a- and b-wave amplitude. This is the first study in real-life conditions to show a specific effect of various antidepressants on retinal function evaluated by electroretinogram. Further investigations should be led to specify the effects of antidepressants on ERG in order to isolate reliable and reproducible markers for predicting and monitoring the response to antidepressants.",2022
A Review of Treatments and Clinical Guidelines for Perinatal Depression.,"Perinatal depression occurs in approximately 1 in 7 women and is considered the most common complication of pregnancy and childbearing. Management of perinatal depression may include a combination of nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies depending on the severity of symptoms, the stage of gestation, and maternal preference. Healthcare providers are recommended to review current guidelines and provide information to women during pregnancy and postpartum regarding the risks and benefits of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment options for perinatal depression. In addition, healthcare providers should consider common barriers to treatment including inadequate screening and social stigma. This article reviews common treatments of perinatal depression as well as the clinical guidelines provided by the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Discussion of nonpharmacological therapies includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). Pharmacological treatments are reviewed by drug class and include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Adjunctive treatments of severe depression, including second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), are also discussed.",Unknown
Duloxetine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation by suppressing iNOS expression in BV-2 microglial cells.,"It is known that both selective serotonin and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SSRI, SNRI) are first-line drugs for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It has also been considered that both SSRI and SNRI can improve the symptoms of major depressive disorder by increasing the concentration of monoamine in the synaptic cleft based on the monoamine hypothesis. However, accumulating evidence has indicated that inflammation in the brain may be a key factor in the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the development of major depressive disorder. It has been advocated that microglial cells may regulate the inflammatory response under pathological conditions such as major depressive disorder. In this study, we focused on whether duloxetine can ameliorate the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BV-2 microglial cells. Our results indicated that duloxetine significantly decreased the NO production induced by LPS. The increase in the protein expression level of iNOS induced by LPS was significantly decreased by treatment with duloxetine. Moreover, the increases in the protein expression levels of phosphorylated-IκBα, phosphorylated-Akt and Akt induced by LPS were also significantly decreased. Unexpectedly, the protein expression levels of other pro-inflammatory factors such as COX-2 and the phosphorylation ratios for various molecules including IκBα and Akt were not changed by treatment with duloxetine. These findings suggest that duloxetine may have an anti-inflammatory effect, which could contribute to its therapeutic effectiveness for major depressive disorder.",2022
Determination of Patient Adherence for Duloxetine in Urine.,"Duloxetine, known by its brand name, CymbaltaTM, is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used to treat major depressive disorders. Determination of patient compliance for duloxetine is typically determined through medication possession ratio (MPR) or plasma concentrations. The purpose of this paper was to characterize normal urinary duloxetine concentrations in patients prescribed duloxetine to monitor patient adherence. Patient data collected from routine screens for duloxetine concentrations in urine were included in this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who were prescribed duloxetine and (i) tested positive for duloxetine, (ii) tested negative for illicit substances and (iii) included creatinine, age and duloxetine dose administered. Of the 5,592 patient urines screened, 2,004 of the results fit into the inclusion criteria. Positive urine concentrations of duloxetine ranged from 50 to 2,722 ng/mL. Duloxetine urine concentrations were normalized to creatinine and dose further characterized by sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and dose in milligrams. Sample distribution included urines collected from 1,487 females and 517 males. The age range of the specimen donors was between 15 and 90 years old with an average age of 52. BMI levels ranged from 13.9 (underweight) to 88.1 (obese), with the average BMI being 33.5. The most common dose of duloxetine prescribed was a daily, oral dose of 60 mg. Analysis of the normalized, transformed creatinine concentrations showed that there was a significant statistical difference (P < 0.05) in the urinary duloxetine concentrations by sex and by dose (mg). Female patients further showed a statistical difference in urinary duloxetine concentration in age groups 18-64 and 64 and older. By characterizing urinary duloxetine concentrations in patients prescribed the medication, normalized distributions of data ranges have been established. These data ranges for urinary duloxetine concentrations can be used to determine patient compliance with duloxetine in routine, clinical samples.",2022
"The Relationships Among Metal Homeostasis, Mitochondria, and Locus Coeruleus in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders: Potential Pathogenetic Mechanism and Therapeutic Implications.","While alterations in the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system are present during early stages of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is unclear what causes these changes and how they contribute to other pathologies in these conditions. Data suggest that the onset of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia is associated with metal dyshomeostasis that causes glial cell mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperactivation in the locus coeruleus. The effect of the overactive locus coeruleus on the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex can be responsible for some of the psychiatric symptoms. Although locus coeruleus overactivation may diminish over time, neuroinflammation-induced alterations are presumably ongoing due to continued metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In early Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction likely induce locus coeruleus hyperactivation, pathological tau or α-synuclein formation, and neurodegeneration, while reduction of glymphatic and cerebrospinal fluid flow might be responsible for β-amyloid aggregation in the olfactory regions before the onset of dementia. It is possible that the overactive noradrenergic system stimulates the apoptosis signaling pathway and pathogenic protein formation, leading to further pathological changes which can occur in the presence or absence of locus coeruleus hypoactivation. Data are presented in this review indicating that although locus coeruleus hyperactivation is involved in pathological changes at prodromal and early stages of these neuropsychiatric disorders, metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction are critical factors in maintaining ongoing neuropathology throughout the course of these conditions. The proposed mechanistic model includes multiple pharmacological sites that may be targeted for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders commonly.",2023
"Disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolism in drug-naïve, first-episode major depressive disorder: a comparative study on adult and adolescent cohorts.","Neurotransmitter metabolism plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, whether the neurotransmitter metabolism in adolescent MDD is differentiated from adult MDD is still elusive. In the current study, plasma concentrations of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters as well as their metabolites, including tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine (NE), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), glutamine (GLN), glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were measured and compared in two cohorts of subjects (adult cohort: 31 first-episode MDD vs. 35 healthy controls; adolescent cohort: 33 first-episode MDD vs. 30 healthy controls). To assess the effects of antidepressant treatment, we also analyzed the concentrations of these indexes pre- and post-treatment in adult and adolescent cohorts. At baseline, the deficits of neurotransmitter metabolism in adult MDD were manifested in all the neurotransmitter systems. In contrast, for adolescent MDD, the dysregulation of neurotransmission was mainly indicated in the catecholaminergic systems. After antidepressant treatment, adult MDD showed increased TRP, KYN, KYNA and GLU levels, together with decreased levels of 5-HIAA and DOPAC. Adolescent MDD illustrated an increased level of 5-HT and decreased levels of TRP and GABA. The improvements of Hamilton total scores correlated with the changes in plasma TRP and the turnover of KYN/TRP after treatment in all MDD patients. However, these correlations were only manifested in the adult MDD rather than in adolescent MDD patients. The findings highlight the shared and distinguished neurotransmitter pathways in MDD and emphasize the different antidepressant responses between adults and adolescents. Potentially, the neurotransmitters above could serve as diagnostic biomarkers and provide a novel pharmacological treatment strategy for MDD.",2022
Medications with Potential for Fetal Risk Prescribed to Veterans.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Women service members of the past 20 years experienced high rates of traumatizing events resulting in pharmacological treatment. Post-military lives may include having children. Typically, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients' pregnancies are managed outside the VHA. This study examined medication exposures during pregnancy. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The Center for Maternal and Infant Outcomes Research in Translation (COMFORT) study collected primary survey data and linked secondary health care data from the VHA from 2015 to 2021. Medication fills and covariates were extracted for three 9-month periods: preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum. Multiple regression assessed factors associated with use during pregnancy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or of non-recommended, potentially risky drugs, and of discontinuation of those medications from prepregnancy to pregnancy. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The cohort comprised 501 women-29% Black, 65% White, and 6% other races, of whom 63% had 50%-100% service-connected disability. During pregnancy, 36% had a pain-related disorder, 19% major depression, and 18% post-traumatic stress disorder. The median number of drug classes prescribed during pregnancy was 5. The use of SSRI/SNRI antidepressants dropped from 36% preconception to 26% during pregnancy including new starts; 15% discontinued SSRI/SNRI. Comorbidity predicted medication use. Depression predicted discontinuing SSRI/SNRI during pregnancy; no predictors of discontinuing potentially risky drugs were identified. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Based on prescriptions filled within the VHA only-ignoring potential community-based fills-women veterans were prescribed numerous medications during pregnancy and discontinued antidepressants alarmingly. Veterans of childbearing potential should receive counseling about medication use before pregnancy occurs. Their non-VHA obstetricians and VHA providers should share information to optimize outcomes, reviewing medications as soon as pregnancy is detected as well as after pregnancy concludes.",2022
The Antidepressant Duloxetine Inhibits Platelet Function and Protects against Thrombosis.,"While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the primary cause of disability, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Interestingly, there is evidence that CVD is more prevalent in people with MDD. It is well established that neurotransmitters, namely serotonin and norepinephrine, are involved in the biochemical mechanisms of MDD, and consequently, drugs targeting serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake, such as duloxetine, are commonly prescribed for MDD. In this connection, serotonin and norepinephrine are also known to play critical roles in primary hemostasis. Based on these considerations, we investigated if duloxetine can be repurposed as an antiplatelet medication. Our results-using human and/or mouse platelets show that duloxetine dose-dependently inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation, compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, it also blocked agonist-induced dense and α-granule secretion, integrin αIIbβ3 activation, phosphatidylserine expression, and clot retraction. Moreover duloxetine-treated mice had a significantly prolonged occlusion time. Finally, duloxetine was also found to impair hemostasis. Collectively, our data indicate that the antidepressant duloxetine, which is a serotonin-norepinephrine antagonist, exerts antiplatelet and thromboprotective effects and inhibits hemostasis. Consequently, duloxetine, or a rationally designed derivative, presents potential benefits in the context of CVD, including that associated with MDD.",2022
Association between selective serotonin and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor therapy and hematuria.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are used as first-line treatment for many psychiatric diseases, especially major depressive disorder. However, an important side effect of these drugs is the risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of hematuria in patients using SSRI/SNRIs and to compare with a control group. This study included patients who were followed up and treated with SSRI/SNRI in the psychiatric outpatient clinic of the Antalya Medical Park Hospital between 1 January 2021 and 31 March 2021 and a control group comprising patients who presented to the medical check-up outpatient clinic between the same dates. Complete urinalysis was performed for all patients and the results were compared between the groups. Each group included 100 patients with a female/male ratio of 1. The mean age was 41.45 ± 13.47 (16-74) years in the study group and 40.51 ± 13.75 (20-70) years in the control group (<i>p</i> = 0.519). Mean duration of SSRI/SNRI use in the study group was 13.35 ± 1.32 (1-64) months. The prevalence of hematuria was 17% in the SSRI/SNRI group and 6% in the control group (<i>p</i> = 0.015). All cases of hematuria were microscopic hematuria. Hematuria is significantly more common in patients receiving SSRI/SNRI treatment. The use of SSRI/SNRI should also be taken into account when investigating the etiology of hematuria.",2023
Microvascular β-Adrenergic Receptor-Mediated Vasodilation Is Attenuated in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with sympathetic overactivity and alterations in peripheral adrenergic receptor function; however, no studies have directly assessed vasoconstrictor responsiveness in adults with MDD. We tested the hypotheses that β-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilation would be blunted in adults with MDD compared with healthy nondepressed adults (HA) and would functionally contribute to exaggerated norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction. In 13 HA (8 female; 24±4 years) and in 12 adults with MDD (8 female; 22±3 yrs), red blood cell flux was measured during graded intradermal microdialysis perfusion of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (10<sup>-10</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>4</sup> mol/L) and, separately, during the perfusion of norepinephrine (10<sup>-</sup><sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup> mol/L), alone and in combination with the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 mmol/L). Nonadrenergic vasoconstriction was assessed via perfusion of angiotensin II (10<sup>-</sup><sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>4</sup> mol/L). Isoproterenol-induced vasodilation was blunted in adults with MDD (188.9±70.1 HA versus 128.3±39.4 au MDD, <i>P</i>=0.025). Net norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was exaggerated in adults with MDD (-0.16±0.54 HA versus -0.75±0.56 au MDD, <i>P</i>=0.014); however, there were no group differences in angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Propranolol potentiated norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in HA (-0.16±0.54 norepinephrine versus -1.60±1.40 au propranolol, <i>P</i><0.01) but had no effect in adults with MDD (-0.75±0.56 norepinephrine versus -1.58±1.56 au propranolol, <i>P</i>=0.08). β-adrenergic receptor-mediated microvascular vasodilation was blunted in adults with MDD and contributed to exaggerated adrenergic vasoconstriction. The relative loss of the vasoprotective effect of β-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilation may contribute to increased peripheral resistance, thereby driving the development of hypertension in adults with MDD.",2022
The Role of the Locus Coeruleus in Pain and Associated Stress-Related Disorders.,"The locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenergic system is the main source of noradrenaline in the central nervous system and is involved intensively in modulating pain and stress-related disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder and anxiety) and in their comorbidity. However, the mechanisms involving the LC that underlie these effects have not been fully elucidated, in part owing to the technical difficulties inherent in exploring such a tiny nucleus. However, novel research tools are now available that have helped redefine the LC system, moving away from the traditional view of LC as a homogeneous structure that exerts a uniform influence on neural activity. Indeed, innovative techniques such as DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) and optogenetics have demonstrated the functional heterogeneity of LC, and novel magnetic resonance imaging applications combined with pupillometry have opened the way to evaluate LC activity in vivo. This review aims to bring together the data available on the efferent activity of the LC-noradrenergic system in relation to pain and its comorbidity with anxiodepressive disorders. Acute pain triggers a robust LC stress response, producing spinal cord-mediated endogenous analgesia while promoting aversion, vigilance, and threat detection through its ascending efferents. However, this protective biological system fails in chronic pain, and LC activity produces pain facilitation, anxiety, increased aversive memory, and behavioral despair, acting at the medulla, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala levels. Thus, the activation/deactivation of specific LC projections contributes to different behavioral outcomes in the shift from acute to chronic pain.",2022
Evaluation of Nanocurcumin Effects on Depressive-Like Behaviors in Rats and Determination of Serum BDNF and Serotonin Levels.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric condition worldwide, and it is the leading cause of disability globally. Turmeric, an aromatic perennial herb widely used in traditional Asian medicine and cuisine, contains curcumin, which has several biological effects, including a pseudoantidepressant effect. However, curcumin's low bioavailability limits its effectiveness. This study evaluated nanocurcumin (NCUR) effects on depressive-like behaviors and examined serum BDNF and serotonin levels in a chronic stress model in rats. Behavioral assessments and biochemical indicators elucidated NCUR's antidepressant-like properties. In this experimental study, 30 adult male rats were randomly divided into six groups and exposed to unexpected chronic mild stress (UCMS). The groups included: control (CG), stress control (SCG), fluoxetine (FLU) treatment (20 mg/kg), and three NCUR doses (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg). Before UCMS exposure, rats underwent a sucrose preference test (SPT). Depressive behaviors were then assessed using the open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) on days 27 and 28. Blood samples were collected on day 28 to measure serum Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NCUR treatment significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors in stressed rats. The sucrose preference index of the SCG decreased after 26 days of stress, while NCUR (all doses) and FLU reversed this effect. In the FST and TST, immobility time was significantly reduced in the NCUR and FLU groups compared to the SCG (p < 0.05). The OFT also showed that the SCG had significantly fewer crossings compared to treated groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, NCUR treatment significantly increased serum BDNF and serotonin levels compared to the SCG. This study demonstrates that NCUR exerts antidepressant-like effects, improving depressive behaviors and increasing BDNF and serotonin levels in rats exposed to chronic stress. NCUR may offer a promising alternative for the treatment of MDD.",2025
Antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of a combination of Saffron and Chamomile in rats and their relationship with serotonin using methods.,"To explore the potential of combining natural herbs like chamomile and saffron for the management of anxiety and depression. A rodent model of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety, secondary to streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus was made. A total of 6 rat groups were chosen; healthy and diseased controls; and diseased test groups of fluoxetine, saffron, chamomile, and combined saffron and chamomile treated (<i>n =</i> 6/group). Activity by forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and correlations with biochemical markers like serum glucose, tryptophan, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydrox-ytryptamine 2C receptor (5HT2CR) expression, were assessed at the end of the 3rd week of the treatment. A one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test was applied. The combined herbal treatment group showed significantly better (<i>P <</i>0.05) than all other groups in terms of anti-hyperglycemic effect. All treatments improved the CRP levels; however, the combination group was also significantly better than fluoxetine and the individual herb groups. Only the herb groups showed efficacy in the FST with added benefits of the combination group over the healthy controls and similar trends in the EPMT. However, expression of 5HT2CR was repressed while BDNF was elevated through treatment. This study shows that in comparison to treatment with a SSRI, and individual herbs, the combination of chamomile and saffron showed overall improved outcomes.",2025
Effect of antidepressants and social defeat stress on the activity of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons in free-moving animals.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most common mental disorders worldwide and is characterized by dysregulated reward processing associated with anhedonia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for MDD; however, their onset of action is delayed. Recent reports have shown that serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are activated by rewards and play a vital role in reward processing. However, whether antidepressant treatment affects the DRN serotonin neuronal response to rewards in awake animals remains unknown. In this study, we measured the activity of DRN serotonin neurons in awake mice and determined the effects of antidepressants and chronic stress on DRN serotonin neuronal activity. We found that acute treatment with citalopram, an SSRI, significantly decreased sucrose-induced activation of DRN serotonin neurons. The decrease in response to acute citalopram treatment was attenuated by chronic citalopram treatment. Acute treatment with (S)-WAY100135, a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist, dose-dependently inhibited the response to acute citalopram treatment. These results indicate that autoinhibition by activating 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors via acute SSRI treatment may blunt the reward response, which can be recovered after chronic SSRI treatment.",2025
"Metabolomics signatures of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (duloxetine) and cognitive-behavioral therapy on key neurotransmitter pathways in major depressive disorder.","Metabolomics provides powerful tools that can inform about heterogeneity in disease and response to treatments. In this exploratory study, we employed an electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics platform to assess the metabolic effects of three randomly-assigned treatments: escitalopram, duloxetine, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in 163 treatment-naïve outpatients with major depressive disorder. Serum samples from baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment were analyzed using targeted liquid chromatography-electrochemistry for metabolites related to tryptophan, tyrosine metabolism and related pathways. Changes in metabolite concentrations related to each treatment arm were identified and compared to define metabolic signatures of exposure. In addition, association between metabolites and depressive symptom severity (assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD<sub>17</sub>]) and anxiety symptom severity (assessed with the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HRSA<sub>14</sub>]) were evaluated, both at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Significant reductions in serum serotonin level and increases in tryptophan-derived indoles that are gut bacterially derived were observed with escitalopram and duloxetine arms but not in CBT arm. These include indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) and Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin. Purine-related metabolites were decreased across all arms. Different metabolites correlated with improved symptoms in the different treatment arms revealing potentially different mechanisms between response to antidepressant medications and to CBT.",2025
Efficacy of probiotic adjuvant therapy in women with major depressive disorder: insights from a case series study.,"The therapeutic targeting of the intestinal microbiota has gained increasing attention as a promising avenue for addressing mood disorders. This study aimed to assess the potential effect of supplementing standard pharmacological treatment with the probiotic kefir in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Thirty-eight female participants diagnosed with moderate MDD by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) were selected to receive the probiotic kefir in conjunction with antidepressant therapy for 12 weeks. The participants were evaluated at baseline (T0) and 90 days after probiotic kefir supplementation (T90). HAM-D scores and blood samples were collected at both time points. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduced MDD severity, as evidenced by lower HAM-D scores compared to baseline. Probiotic consumption for 90 days also significantly decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels compared to baseline. However, probiotic kefir supplementation did not significantly affect serum serotonin levels. Additionally, after 90 days of probiotic consumption, insulin and morning cortisol levels were significantly reduced. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in serum levels of prolactin, vitamin D, and afternoon cortisol. This study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of probiotics, specifically kefir, as adjunctive therapy for female patients with MDD. The findings highlight promising results in ameliorating depressive symptoms and modulating inflammatory and hormonal markers.",2025
"Benefits and Challenges of Ultra-Fast, Short-Acting Psychedelics in the Treatment of Depression.","Unlike classical antidepressants, psychedelics such as psilocybin have been shown to induce a rapid antidepressant response. In the wake of this development, interest has emerged in ultra-fast, short-acting psychedelics such as 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with the expectation that these can produce rapid antidepressant effects following an intense but brief psychedelic intervention. The current paper reviews the clinical pharmacology of 5-MeO-DMT and DMT and their potential benefits and challenges in the treatment of depression. Both compounds display affinities for a variety of monoamine receptors and transporters, but mostly so for serotonergic (5HT) receptors, including 5HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5HT<sub>2A</sub>. Early clinical trials in small samples have shown that short interventions (15-30 min) with 5-MeO-DMT and DMT are safe and well tolerated and can induce marked improvement in symptoms of depression within 24 hours that sustain for at least 1 week. Data on long-term efficacy are currently scarce but do suggest a prolongation of the treatment response. Potential benefits of these treatments include flexible, single day dosing regimens, achievement of treatment efficacy independent from integrative therapy, and ease of clinical implementation. Future challenges include establishing the duration of the antidepressant effect and strategies on how to sustain the antidepressant response, optimization of treatment delivery parameters, and a mechanistic understanding of the clinical response. Acceptance of ultra-fast, short-acting psychedelics will depend on future randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a focus on replication, duration and maintenance of antidepressant efficacy in large patient samples.",2025
Effect of esketamine on serum neurotransmitters in patients with postpartum depression: a randomized controlled trial.,"The development of postpartum depression has been linked to fluctuations in the levels of neurotransmitters in the human body, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (Norepinephrine, NE), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research has indicated that the antidepressant effect of esketamine are mediated by monoamine transmitters and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we postulate that intravenous administration of esketamine in patients with postpartum depression may alter the serum concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Three hundred fifteen patients with postpartum depression were selected and divided into two groups based on randomized numerical expression: esketamine (E) group (0. 25 mg/kg esketamine) and control (C) group (a same volume of 0.9% saline), all the drugs were pumped for 40 min. After the end of drug pumping, all patients were continuously observed for 2 h. Changes in serum levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, BDNF were recorded before drug administration and on the 3rd day after drug administration. The scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were calculated before drug administration, and on the 3rd day and on the 30th day after drug administration. Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and feeling of detachment occurred were recorded within 2 h after drug administration. Before drug administration, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (0. 91 ± 0. 19 vs. 0. 98 ± 0. 21, P = 0. 181), (2. 38 ± 0. 35 vs. 2. 32 ± 0. 32, P = 0. 491), (3. 07 ± 0. 89 vs 3. 02 ± 0. 88, P = 0. 828), (39. 79 ± 7. 78 vs 41. 34 ± 10. 03, P = 0. 506). On the third day post-medication, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (1. 42 ± 0. 35 vs. 0. 96 ± 0. 24, P < 0. 001), (3. 99 ± 0. 17 vs. 2. 41 ± 0. 28, P < 0. 001),(5. 45 ± 0. 81 vs 3. 22 ± 0. 76, P < 0. 001),(44. 36 ± 9. 98 vs 40. 69 ± 11. 75, P = 0. 198). Before medication, the EPDS scores were (16. 15 ± 3. 02 vs 17. 85 ± 3. 89, P = 0. 064). on the third day after medication, the Group E had significantly reduced scores (12. 98 ± 2. 39 vs 16. 73 ± 3. 52, P < 0. 001). On the 30rd day after medication, EPDS scores between the two groups were (16. 34 ± 3. 43 vs 16. 91 ± 4. 02, p = 0. 203). Within 2 h of medication, the rate of adverse events was similar between the two groups. Small doses of esketamine can increase the serum concentration of 5-HT,DA,BDNF, and in the short term, decrease EPDS scores, and improve postpartum depressive symptoms. Retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300078343, 2023/12/05).",2024
Involvement of serotonergic receptors in depressive processes and their modulation by β-arrestins: A review.,"Over time, several studies have been conducted to demonstrate the functions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), better known as serotonin. This neurotransmitter is associated with the modulation of various social and physiological behaviors, and its dysregulation has consequences at the behavioral level, leading to various neurophysiological disorders. Disorders such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, sexual disorders, and eating disorders, have been closely linked to variations in 5-HT concentrations and modifications in brain structures, including the raphe nuclei (RN), prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, among others. The involvement of β-arrestin proteins has been implicated in the modulation of the serotonergic receptor response, as well as the activation of different signaling pathways related to the serotonergic system, this is particularly relevant in depressive disorders. This review will cover the implications of alterations in 5-HT receptor expression in depressive disorders in one hand and how β-arrestin proteins modulate the response mediated by these receptors in the other hand.",2024
Histone serotonylation in dorsal raphe nucleus contributes to stress- and antidepressant-mediated gene expression and behavior.,"Mood disorders are an enigmatic class of debilitating illnesses that affect millions of individuals worldwide. While chronic stress clearly increases incidence levels of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), stress-mediated disruptions in brain function that precipitate these illnesses remain largely elusive. Serotonin-associated antidepressants (ADs) remain the first line of therapy for many with depressive symptoms, yet low remission rates and delays between treatment and symptomatic alleviation have prompted skepticism regarding direct roles for serotonin in the precipitation and treatment of affective disorders. Our group recently demonstrated that serotonin epigenetically modifies histone proteins (H3K4me3Q5ser) to regulate transcriptional permissiveness in brain. However, this non-canonical phenomenon has not yet been explored following stress and/or AD exposures. Here, we employed a combination of genome-wide and biochemical analyses in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of male and female mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress, as well as in DRN of human MDD patients, to examine the impact of stress exposures/MDD diagnosis on H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics, as well as associations between the mark and depression-related gene expression. We additionally assessed stress-induced/MDD-associated regulation of H3K4me3Q5ser following AD exposures, and employed viral-mediated gene therapy in mice to reduce H3K4me3Q5ser levels in DRN and examine its impact on stress-associated gene expression and behavior. We found that H3K4me3Q5ser plays important roles in stress-mediated transcriptional plasticity. Chronically stressed mice displayed dysregulated H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics in DRN, with both AD- and viral-mediated disruption of these dynamics proving sufficient to attenuate stress-mediated gene expression and behavior. Corresponding patterns of H3K4me3Q5ser regulation were observed in MDD subjects on vs. off ADs at their time of death. These findings thus establish a neurotransmission-independent role for serotonin in stress-/AD-associated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity, observations of which may be of clinical relevance to human MDD and its treatment.",2024
Beyond the serotonin deficit hypothesis: communicating a neuroplasticity framework of major depressive disorder.,"The serotonin deficit hypothesis explanation for major depressive disorder (MDD) has persisted among clinicians and the general public alike despite insufficient supporting evidence. To combat rising mental health crises and eroding public trust in science and medicine, researchers and clinicians must be able to communicate to patients and the public an updated framework of MDD: one that is (1) accessible to a general audience, (2) accurately integrates current evidence about the efficacy of conventional serotonergic antidepressants with broader and deeper understandings of pathophysiology and treatment, and (3) capable of accommodating new evidence. In this article, we summarize a framework for the pathophysiology and treatment of MDD that is informed by clinical and preclinical research in psychiatry and neuroscience. First, we discuss how MDD can be understood as inflexibility in cognitive and emotional brain circuits that involves a persistent negativity bias. Second, we discuss how effective treatments for MDD enhance mechanisms of neuroplasticity-including via serotonergic interventions-to restore synaptic, network, and behavioral function in ways that facilitate adaptive cognitive and emotional processing. These treatments include typical monoaminergic antidepressants, novel antidepressants like ketamine and psychedelics, and psychotherapy and neuromodulation techniques. At the end of the article, we discuss this framework from the perspective of effective science communication and provide useful language and metaphors for researchers, clinicians, and other professionals discussing MDD with a general or patient audience.",2024
Depression and type 2 diabetes: A causal relationship and mechanistic pathway.,"Depression is a mood disorder that may increase risk for the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and vice versa. However, the mechanistic pathway linking depression and T2D is not fully elucidated. The aim of this narrative review, therefore, was to discuss the possible link between depression and T2D. The coexistence of T2D and depression is twice as great compared to the occurrence of either condition independently. Hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia promote the incidence of depression by enhancing inflammation and reducing brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5HT]). Dysregulation of insulin signalling in T2D impairs brain 5HT signalling, leading to the development of depression. Furthermore, depression is associated with the development of hyperglycaemia and poor glycaemic control. Psychological stress and depression promote the development of T2D. In conclusion, T2D could be a potential risk factor for the development of depression through the induction of inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress that affect brain neurotransmission. In addition, chronic stress in depression may induce the development of T2D through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increase circulating cortisol levels, which triggers IR and T2D.",2024
Scn1a haploinsufficiency in the prefrontal cortex leads to cognitive impairment and depressive phenotype.,"Altered development and function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during adolescence is implicated in the origin of mental disorders. Deficits in the GABAergic system prominently contribute to these alterations. Nav1.1 is a voltage-gated Na+ channel critical for normal GABAergic activity. Here, we studied the role of Nav1.1 in PFC function and its potential relationship with the aetiology of mental disorders. Dysfunction of Nav1.1 activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) of adolescent mice enhanced the local excitation/inhibition ratio, resulting in epileptic activity, cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviour in adulthood, along with a gene expression profile linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). Additionally, it reduced extracellular serotonin concentration in the dorsal raphe nucleus and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the hippocampus, two MDD-related brain areas beyond the PFC. We also observed alterations in oscillatory activity and impaired hippocampal-mPFC coherence during sleep. Finally, we found reduced expression levels of SCN1A, the gene encoding Nav1.1, in post-mortem PFC samples from human MDD subjects. Collectively, our results provide a novel mechanistic framework linking adolescence-specific alterations in Nav1.1 function in the PFC to the pathogenesis of epilepsy and comorbidities such as cognitive impairment and depressive disorders.",2024
Peripheral serotonin levels as a predictor of antidepressant treatment response: A systematic review.,"There are currently no reliable biomarkers to predict clinical response to pharmacological treatments of depressive disorders. Peripheral blood 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has been suggested as a biomarker of antidepressant treatment response, but there has not been an attempt to systematically summarize and evaluate the scientific evidence of this hypothesis. In this systematic review we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Twenty-six relevant studies investigating peripheral 5-HT as an antidepressant biomarker were identified. In all, we did not find robust support for an association between baseline 5-HT and treatment response. Several larger studies with lower risk of bias, however, showed that higher baseline 5-HT was associated with a greater antidepressant response to SSRIs, prompting future studies to investigate this hypothesis. Our results also confirm previous reports that SSRI treatment is associated with a decrease in peripheral 5-HT levels; however, we were not able to confirm that larger decreases of 5-HT are associated with better treatment outcome as results were inconclusive.",2024
"Pentoxifylline as a Novel Add-on Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder in Adult Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Evidence indicates an association between immune dysregulation and major depressive disorder (MDD). Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms and pro-inflammatory markers after administration of PTX as an adjunctive agent to citalopram in patients with MDD. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to either citalopram (20 mg/day) plus placebo (twice daily) (n=50) or citalopram (20 mg/day) plus PTX (400 mg) (twice daily) (n=50). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAM-D-17) scores at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and serum levels of interleukin1-β (IL-1-β), tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, IL-6, serotonin, IL-10, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at baseline and week 12 were evaluated. HAM-D-17 score in the PTX group significantly reduced in comparison to the control group after weeks 4, 6, 8,10, and 12 ((LSMD): - 2.193, p=0.021; - 2.597, p=0.036; - 2.916, p=0.019; - 4.336, p=0.005; and - 4.087, p=0.008, respectively). Patients who received PTX had a better response (83%) and remission rate (79%) compared to the placebo group (49% and 40%, p=0.006 and p=0.01, respectively). Moreover, the reduction in serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors and increase in serotonin and BDNF in the PTX group was significantly greater than in the placebo group (p<0.001). These findings support the safety and efficacy of PTX as an adjunctive antidepressant agent with anti-inflammatory effects in patients with MDD.",2024
Perspectives on the impact of vortioxetine on the treatment armamentarium of major depressive disorder.,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a mental health issue that significantly affects patients' quality of life and functioning. Despite available treatments, many patients continue to suffer due to incomplete symptom resolution and side effects. This manuscript examines Vortioxetine's role in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment, highlighting its potential to reshape therapeutic strategies due to its unique Multimodal action and proven broad-spectrum efficacy in multiple depressive domains. A detailed examination of Vortioxetine's pharmacological aspects, including indications, dosage, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, is provided, emphasizing its safety and effectiveness. The discussion extends to Vortioxetine's role in acute-phase treatment and maintenance of MDD and its profound impact on specialized depression domains. Vortioxetine is distinguished for its novel multimodal serotonin modulation mechanism, showcasing significant promise as an innovative treatment for MDD. Its efficacy, which is dose-dependent, along with a commendable tolerability profile, positions it as a potential leading option for initial treatment strategies. The discourse on dosage titration, particularly the strategy of initiating treatment at lower doses followed by gradual escalation, underscores the approach toward minimizing initial adverse effects while optimizing therapeutic outcomes, aligning with the principles of personalized medicine in psychiatric care.",2024
Serotonin effects on human iPSC-derived neural cell functions: from mitochondria to depression.,"Depression's link to serotonin dysregulation is well-known. The monoamine theory posits that depression results from impaired serotonin activity, leading to the development of antidepressants targeting serotonin levels. However, their limited efficacy suggests a more complex cause. Recent studies highlight mitochondria as key players in depression's pathophysiology. Mounting evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction significantly correlates with major depressive disorder (MDD), underscoring its pivotal role in depression. Exploring the serotonin-mitochondrial connection, our study investigated the effects of chronic serotonin treatment on induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and neurons from healthy controls and two case study patients. One was a patient with antidepressant non-responding MDD (""Non-R"") and another had a non-genetic mitochondrial disorder (""Mito""). The results revealed that serotonin altered the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function and dynamics in neurons and had an equalizing effect on calcium homeostasis in astrocytes, while ATP levels seemed increased. Serotonin significantly decreased cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium in neurons. Electrophysiological measurements evidenced that serotonin depolarized the resting membrane potential, increased both sodium and potassium current density and ultimately improved the overall excitability of neurons. Specifically, neurons from the Non-R patient appeared responsive to serotonin in vitro, which seemed to improve neurotransmission. While it is unclear how this translates to the systemic level and AD resistance mechanisms are not fully elucidated, our observations show that despite his treatment resistance, this patient's cortical neurons are responsive to serotonergic signals. In the Mito patient, evidence suggested that serotonin, by increasing excitability, exacerbated an existing hyperexcitability highlighting the importance of considering mitochondrial disorders in patients with MDD, and avoiding serotonin-increasing medication. Taken together, our findings suggested that serotonin positively affects calcium homeostasis in astrocytes and increases neuronal excitability. The latter effect must be considered carefully, as it could have beneficial or detrimental implications based on individual pathologies.",2024
Efficacy and safety of venlafaxine hydrochloride combined with tandospirone citrate for patients with vascular depression accompanied by somatic symptoms: An open-labeled randomized control trial.,"To explore the pharmacological treatment of vascular depression (VaDep) and whether the blood levels of neurotransmitters can reflect the VaDep severity. VaDep patients with somatic symptoms were enrolled and randomly received venlafaxine + tandospirone (Combined Group) or venlafaxine (Monotherapy Group). The treatment efficacy was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15). The levels of blood monoamine neurotransmitters were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both groups reported a progressive decrease in HAMD, HAMA, and PHQ-15 scores to below the baseline after the respective treatment. Compared with the Monotherapy Group, the Combined Group reported a significant decrease in HAMD score at week 2 and markedly lower HAMA and PHQ-15 scores at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. Both groups showed a decrease in the levels of blood monoamine neurotransmitters at weeks 4 and 8 when compared with the baseline. A strong positive association was evident between the plasma 5-HT levels and the HAMD score. The combined therapy rapidly acts on VaDep comorbid with anxiety and somatic symptoms and significantly alleviates the anxiety and somatic symptoms. The plasma levels of 5-HT may serve as potential objective candidates in evaluating VaDep severity and the efficacy of the undertaken treatment regimen.",2024
Affective disorders and the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential: Serotonin and beyond.,"Identifying additional noninvasive biomarkers for affective disorders, such as unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), could aid in the diagnosis and treatment of these prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric conditions. One such candidate biomarker is the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), an event-related potential that measures responsiveness of the auditory cortex to different intensities of sound. The LDAEP has been associated with MDD and BD, including therapeutic response to particular classes of antidepressant drugs, while also correlating with several other neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been suggested that increased values of the LDAEP indicate low central serotonergic neurotransmission, further implicating this EEG measure in depression. Here, we briefly review the literature on the LDAEP in affective disorders, including its association with serotonergic signaling, as well as with that of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine. We summarize key findings on the LDAEP and the genetics of these neurotransmitters, as well as prediction of response to particular classes of antidepressants in MDD, including SSRIs versus noradrenergic agents. The possible relationship between this EEG measure and suicidality is addressed. We also briefly analyze acute pharmacologic studies of serotonin and/or dopamine precursor depletion and the LDAEP. In conclusion, the existing literature suggests that serotonin and norepinephrine may modulate the LDAEP in an opposing manner, and that this event-related marker may be of use in predicting response to chronic treatment with particular pharmacologic agents in the context of affective disorders, such as MDD and BD, including in the presence of suicidality.",2024
The role of serotonin in depression-A historical roundup and future directions.,"Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 280 million people, with probably much higher unrecorded cases. Depression is associated with symptoms such as anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, sleep disturbances, and even suicidal thoughts. Tragically, more than 700 000 people commit suicide each year. Although depression has been studied for many decades, the exact mechanisms that lead to depression are still unknown, and available treatments only help a fraction of patients. In the late 1960s, the serotonin hypothesis was published, suggesting that serotonin is the key player in depressive disorders. However, this hypothesis is being increasingly doubted as there is evidence for the influence of other neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as larger systemic causes such as altered activity in the limbic network or inflammatory processes. In this narrative review, we aim to contribute to the ongoing debate on the involvement of serotonin in depression. We will review the evolution of antidepressant treatments, systemic research on depression over the years, and future research applications that will help to bridge the gap between systemic research and neurotransmitter dynamics using biosensors. These new tools in combination with systemic applications, will in the future provide a deeper understanding of the serotonergic dynamics in depression.",2024
Exploring Novel Antidepressants Targeting G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Key Membrane Receptors Based on Molecular Structures.,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a complex mental disorder that involves alterations in signal transmission across multiple scales and structural abnormalities. The development of effective antidepressants (ADs) has been hindered by the dominance of monoamine hypothesis, resulting in slow progress. Traditional ADs have undesirable traits like delayed onset of action, limited efficacy, and severe side effects. Recently, two categories of fast-acting antidepressant compounds have surfaced, dissociative anesthetics S-ketamine and its metabolites, as well as psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). This has led to structural research and drug development of the receptors that they target. This review provides breakthroughs and achievements in the structure of depression-related receptors and novel ADs based on these. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has enabled researchers to identify the structures of membrane receptors, including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptor. These high-resolution structures can be used for the development of novel ADs using virtual drug screening (VDS). Moreover, the unique antidepressant effects of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in various brain regions, and the pivotal roles of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TrkB) in regulating synaptic plasticity, emphasize their potential as therapeutic targets. Using structural information, a series of highly selective ADs were designed based on the different role of receptors in MDD. These molecules have the favorable characteristics of rapid onset and low adverse drug reactions. This review offers researchers guidance and a methodological framework for the structure-based design of ADs.",2024
Genetically encoded sensors for in vivo detection of neurochemicals relevant to depression.,"Depressive disorders are a common and debilitating form of mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying causes and mechanisms of depressive disorders are still poorly understood. Neurochemical systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, have been implicated in the development and perpetuation of depressive symptoms. Current treatments for depression target these neuromodulator systems, but there is a need for a better understanding of their role in order to develop more effective treatments. Monitoring neurochemical dynamics during depressive symptoms is crucial for gaining a better a understanding of their involvement in depressive disorders. Genetically encoded sensors have emerged recently that offer high spatial-temporal resolution and the ability to monitor neurochemical dynamics in real time. This review explores the neurochemical systems involved in depression and discusses the applications and limitations of current monitoring tools for neurochemical dynamics. It also highlights the potential of genetically encoded sensors for better characterizing neurochemical dynamics in depression-related behaviors. Furthermore, potential improvements to current sensors are discussed in order to meet the requirements of depression research.",2024

Antidepressant-like effects of psychedelics in a chronic despair mouse model: is the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor the unique player?,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders in the world. First-line treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) still have many limitations, including a resistance to treatment in 30% of patients and a delayed clinical benefit that is observed only after several weeks of treatment. Increasing clinical evidence indicates that the acute administration of psychedelic agonists of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R), such as psilocybin, to patients with MDD induce fast antidepressant effects, which persist up to five weeks after the treatment. However, the involvement of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in these antidepressant effects remains controversial. Furthermore, whether the hallucinogenic properties of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R agonists are mandatory to their antidepressant activity is still an open question. Here, we addressed these issues by investigating the effect of two psychedelics of different chemical families, DOI and psilocybin, and a non-hallucinogenic 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R agonist, lisuride, in a chronic despair mouse model exhibiting a robust depressive-like phenotype. We show that a single injection of each drug to wild type mice induces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in the novelty-suppressed feeding, sucrose preference and forced swim tests, which last up to 15 days. DOI and lisuride administration did not produce antidepressant-like effects in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas psilocybin was still effective. Moreover, neither 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R blockade nor dopamine D<sub>1</sub> or D<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade affected the antidepressant-like effects of psilocybin in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R agonists can produce antidepressant-like effects independently of hallucinogenic properties through mechanisms involving or not involving the receptor.",2024
The role of the cholinergic system in the signal attenuation rat model of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"In comparison to studies of the involvement of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), research on the involvement of the cholinergic system in this disorder has remained sparse. The aim of this study was to test the role of the cholinergic system in compulsive behavior using the signal attenuation rat model of OCD. In this model, ""compulsive"" behavior is induced by attenuating a signal indicating that a lever-press response was effective in producing food. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 mg/kg), the nicotinic agonist nicotine (0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.00 mg/kg), the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (1, 3, 5, and 8 mg/kg), the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (0.0075, 0.0150, and 0.0300 mg/kg), and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.15, 0.50, 1.00, and 1.50 mg/kg) were acutely administered to rats just before assessing their lever-press responding following signal attenuation (experiments 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively). Because the effects of signal attenuation are assessed under extinction conditions, drug doses that were effective in the above experiments were also tested in an extinction session of lever-press responding that was not preceded by signal attenuation (experiments 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Acute systemic administration of the cholinergic agents did not exert a selective anti- or pro-compulsive effect in the signal attenuation model. Acetylcholine does not seem to play a role in the signal attenuation rat model of OCD.",2013

On the role of prefrontal cortex glutamate for the antithetical phenomenology of obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"1. The objective of the present study was to compare the phenomenology and pathophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/deficits in attention, motor control and perception (ADHD/DAMP). 2. Through detailed studies of the literature on OCD and ADHD/DAMP, the phenomenology of these two conditions is compared, and possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involving interactions between glutamate, dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine are discussed, with emphasis on OCD. The present paper also discusses possible mechanisms of action for current pharmacological treatments of OCD and ADHD, as well as possible future treatment strategies for these disorders. 3. OCD and ADHD/DAMP are common neuropsychiatric conditions which in many regards appear to be each other's antipodes with respect to clinical manifestations, associated personality traits and brain biochemistry, notably prefrontal cortical glutamate activity. Future pharmacological treatments of these disorders may involve manipulations with glutamate, dopamine D , serotonin 2A and nicotine receptors. 4.

Behavior Changes in Quinpirole Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Rats Treated with 6-Hydroxydopamine and the Corresponding Dopaminergic Compulsive Loop Mechanism.,"Recent studies suggest that the anterior limb of the internal capsule may be an area of convergence for multiple compulsion loops. In this study, the role of different dopaminergic compulsion loops in the mechanism of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was investigated by selectively damaging dopaminergic neurons or fibers in the corresponding targets with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and depicting the anatomical map of various compulsion loops located in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. A total of 52 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to either saline (1 mL/kg, NS group, n = 6) or quinpirole (QNP, dopamine D2-agonist, 0.5 mg/kg, n = 46) twice weekly for 5 weeks. After each injection, the rats were placed on an open field to analyze aspects of their behaviour, including the number of home base visits (NOH), average time between each home base visit (ATBO), and total distance travelled (TDM). After model setup, 46 QNP rats were divided randomly into five groups: 6-OHDA anterior limb of internal capsule (AC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+AC group, n = 10), 6-OHDA mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) stereotactic injection group (QNP+MD group, n = 10), 6-OHDA nucleus accumbens (NAC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+NAC group, n = 10), saline stereotactic injection group (QNP+NS-S group, n = 10), and non-surgical group (QNP+Non-S group, n = 6). In the NS group, rats simultaneously received a 6-OHDA stereotactic injection (NS+6-OHDA-S group, n = 6: AC2, MD2, NAC2). All QNP-treated rats were then continued to be given QNP twice a week for 4 weeks, and their behaviour was observed after each infusion. After 4 weeks, immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the distribution of dopamine neurons and nerve fibers in different areas of the intervention nerve loops, and quantitative analysis was performed. Compulsive behaviour declined gradually in the QNP+AC and QNP+NAC groups 3 and 4 weeks after surgery, with the QNP+AC group decreasing more rapidly. The QNP+MD group had decreased by 3 weeks after surgery but increased to almost the same level as pre-surgery at 4 weeks post-surgery. Postoperative fluorescence staining and quantitative analysis suggested the number of dopamine (DA) neurons or nerve fibers in the corresponding target area of the 6-OHDA injection were significantly reduced compared with the QNP+Non-S group. 6-OHDA selectively damages the targets of dopaminergic neurons or nerve fibers within the OCD loop, which somewhat alleviates compulsive behaviours. The results suggest that the AC might be the best target for therapeutic interventions for OCD.",2025
Unveiling serotonergic dysfunction of obsessive-compulsive disorder on prefrontal network dynamics: a computational perspective.,"Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",2024
Probing midbrain dopamine function in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder via neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing psychiatric condition, which often onsets in childhood. Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N = 135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n = 64 had an OCD diagnosis. N = 47 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p = 0.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p = 0.004, Cohen's d = 0.51) and ventral tegmental area (p = 0.006, d = 0.50). Follow-up analyses indicated that more severe lifetime symptoms (t = -2.72, p = 0.009) and longer illness duration (t = -2.22, p = 0.03) related to lower neuromelanin-MRI signal. Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p < 0.001, d = 1.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response.",2023
Midbrain dopamine neurons arbiter OCD-like behavior.,"The neurobiological understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes dysregulated frontostriatal circuitry and altered monoamine transmission. Repetitive stereotyped behavior (e.g., grooming), a featured symptom in OCD, has been proposed to be associated with perturbed dopamine (DA) signaling. However, the precise brain circuits participating in DA's control over this behavioral phenotype remain elusive. Here, we identified that DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) orchestrate ventromedial striatum (VMS) microcircuits as well as lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) during self-grooming behavior. SNc-VMS and SNc-lOFC dopaminergic projections modulate grooming behaviors and striatal microcircuit function differentially. Specifically, the activity of the SNc-VMS pathway promotes grooming via D1 receptors, whereas the activity of the SNc-lOFC pathway suppresses grooming via D2 receptors. SNc DA neuron activity thus controls the OCD-like behaviors via both striatal and cortical projections as dual gating. These results support both pharmacological and brain-stimulation treatments for OCD.",2022
Case Report: Possible autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder with postpartum onset.,"Autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is rare. The case presented here is that of a female patient in her mid-thirties who developed postpartum OCD. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple juxtacortical hyperintensities that may have been post-inflammatory in origin. In tissue-based assays using mouse brain slices, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed novel anti-nucleoli autoantibodies in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons. The CSF dopamine and glutamate concentrations were dysregulated. The clinical course and diagnostic findings were compatible with possible autoimmune OCD with postpartum onset.",2022
Developmental impact of glutamate transporter overexpression on dopaminergic neuron activity and stereotypic behavior.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition that often begins in childhood. Genetic studies in OCD have pointed to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, with evidence suggesting that increased expression contributes to risk. In mice, midbrain Slc1a1 expression supports repetitive behavior in response to dopaminergic agonists, aligning with neuroimaging and pharmacologic challenge studies that have implicated the dopaminergic system in OCD. These findings suggest that Slc1a1 may contribute to compulsive behavior through altered dopaminergic transmission; however, this theory has not been mechanistically tested. To examine the developmental impact of Slc1a1 overexpression on compulsive-like behaviors, we, therefore, generated a novel mouse model to perform targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in dopaminergic neurons. Mice with life-long overexpression of Slc1a1 showed a significant increase in amphetamine (AMPH)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that Slc1a1 overexpression was associated with increased firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dLight1.1 fiber photometry showed that these behavioral abnormalities were associated with increased dorsal striatum dopamine release. In contrast, no impact of overexpression was observed on anxiety-like behaviors or SKF-38393-induced grooming. Importantly, overexpression solely in adulthood failed to recapitulate these behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that overexpression during development is necessary to generate AMPH-induced phenotypes. However, doxycycline-induced reversal of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression in adulthood normalized both the increased dopaminergic firing and AMPH-induced responses. These data indicate that the pathologic effects of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression on dopaminergic neurotransmission and AMPH-induced stereotyped behavior are developmentally mediated, and support normalization of EAAT3 activity as a potential treatment target for basal ganglia-mediated repetitive behaviors.",2022
Comprehensive exploration of the genetic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways to psychiatric disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent and display considerable clinical and genetic overlap. Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission have been shown to play an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Here we aim to assess the genetic contribution of these systems to eight psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (ANO), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and Tourette's syndrome (TS)) using publicly available GWAS analyses performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium that include more than 160,000 cases and 275,000 controls. To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic examination of genes encoding proteins essential to the function of these two neurotransmitter systems in these disorders. Our results support a pleiotropic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in several psychiatric conditions.",2022
Dorsal striatal dopamine induces fronto-cortical hypoactivity and attenuates anxiety and compulsive behaviors in rats.,"Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",2022
"Altering the development of the dopaminergic system through social play in rats: Implications for anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and compulsivity.","Dopamine is essential to many functions like reward, motivation, and attention; when its neural pathways do not function properly, various disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, compulsions) can arise. Truncated-DAT rats display persistent stereotypies and aggressiveness; hence they are a new valuable animal model to study the pathogenesis of these disorders. The focus of research is often on the individual epigenetic determinants and much less on the impact of social experiences. Here, we investigate the developmental impact of the social environment on adolescent wild type (WT) rats. We divided subjects at weaning into three groups: living with another adolescent (WT Peer), with a WT adult, or with a truncated-DAT one, and we observed homecage social behavior of these pairs (play, jump, victory, and ""bullying"") during whole adolescence. When adult, we observed the same subjects in plus maze, forced swim, and social preference tests to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and quality of social interactions. Compared to the other groups, WT rats that had spent their adolescence with a truncated-DAT adult as companion show more anxious, depressive, hyperactive, impulsive, and compulsive behaviours. Results confirm that social interactions and healthy play (i.e., when play has behavioural, social, and psychomotor rewards that support the cognitive, emotional and physical development of the individual) are essential to neurobehavioral maturation. Conversely, anomalous interactions like poor play and ""bullying"" in developing rats may impact onto their dopaminergic system. Consequently, an impoverished social play could be one of the factors contributing to the appearance of putative indexes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and\or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",2021
Disruption of prepulse inhibition is associated with compulsive behavior severity and nucleus accumbens dopamine receptor changes in Sapap3 knockout mice.,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with disruption of sensorimotor gating, which may contribute to difficulties inhibiting intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals. Neural mechanisms underlying these disturbances are unclear; however, striatal dopamine is implicated in regulation of sensorimotor gating and OCD pathophysiology. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between sensorimotor gating, compulsive behavior, and striatal dopamine receptor levels in Sapap3 knockout mice (KOs), a widely used preclinical model system for OCD research. We found a trend for disruption of sensorimotor gating in Sapap3-KOs using the translational measure prepulse inhibition (PPI); however, there was significant heterogeneity in both PPI and compulsive grooming in KOs. Disruption of PPI was significantly correlated with a more severe compulsive phenotype. In addition, PPI disruption and compulsive grooming severity were associated with reduced dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC). Compulsive grooming progressively worsened in Sapap3-KOs tested longitudinally, but PPI disruption was first detected in high-grooming KOs at 7 months of age. Through detailed characterization of individual differences in OCD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical measures, our findings suggest that NAcC dopamine receptor changes may be involved in disruption of sensorimotor gating and compulsive behavior relevant to OCD.",2021
Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD.,"Effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments are well established for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are first-line treatment and are of benefit to about half of patients. Augmentation of SRI treatment with low-dose neuroleptics is an evidence-based second-line strategy. Specialty psychotherapy is also used as both first-line and second-line treatment and can benefit many. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to these treatments. New alternatives are urgently needed. This review summarizes evidence for these established pharmacotherapeutic strategies, and for others that have been investigated in refractory disease but are not supported by the same level of evidence. We focus on three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We summarize evidence from genetic, neuroimaging, animal model, and other lines of investigation that probe these three systems in patients with OCD. We also review recent work on predictors of response to current treatments. While many studies suggest abnormalities that may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, most studies have been small, and non-replication of reported findings has been common. Nevertheless, the gradual accrual of evidence for neurotransmitter dysregulation may in time lead the way to new pharmacological strategies.",2021
Dissociable dopaminergic and pavlovian influences in goal-trackers and sign-trackers on a model of compulsive checking in OCD.,"Checking is a functional behaviour that provides information to guide behaviour. However, in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), checking may escalate to dysfunctional levels. The processes underpinning the transition from functional to dysfunctional checking are unclear but may be associated with individual differences that support the development of maladaptive behaviour. We examined one such predisposition, sign-tracking to a pavlovian conditioned stimulus, which we previously found associated with dysfunctional checking. How sign-tracking interacts with another treatment with emerging translational validity for OCD-like checking, chronic administration of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist quinpirole, is unknown. We tested how functional and dysfunctional checking in the rat observing response task (ORT) was affected by chronic quinpirole administration in non-autoshaped controls and autoshaped animals classified as sign-trackers or goal-trackers. Sign-trackers or goal-trackers were trained on the ORT before the effects of chronic quinpirole administration on checking were assessed. Subsequently, the effects on checking of different behavioural challenges, including reward omission and the use of unpredictable reinforcement schedules, were tested. Prior autoshaping increased checking. Sign-trackers and goal-trackers responded differently to quinpirole sensitization, reward omission and reinforcement uncertainty. Sign-trackers showed greater elevations in dysfunctional checking, particularly during uncertainty. By contrast, goal-trackers predominantly increased functional checking responses, possibly in response to reduced discrimination accuracy in the absence of cues signalling which lever was currently active. The results are discussed in terms of how pavlovian associations influence behaviour that becomes compulsive in OCD and how this may be dependent on striatal dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors.",2020
Dopaminergic drug treatment remediates exaggerated cingulate prediction error responses in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been found to show exaggerated error responses and prediction error learning signals in a variety of EEG and fMRI tasks, with data converging on the anterior cingulate cortex as a key locus of dysfunction. Considerable evidence has linked prediction error processing to dopaminergic function. In this study, we investigate potential dopaminergic dysfunction during reward processing in the context of OCD. We studied OCD patients (n = 18) and controls (n = 18) whilst they learned probabilistic associations between abstract stimuli and monetary rewards in the fMRI scanner involving administration (on separate visits) of a dopamine receptor agonist, pramipexole 0.5 mg; a dopamine receptor antagonist, amisulpride 400 mg; and placebo. We fitted a Q-learning computational model to fMRI prediction error responses; group differences were examined in anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens regions of interest. There were no significant group, drug, or interaction effects in the number of correct choices; computational modeling suggested a marginally significant difference in learning rates between groups (p = 0.089, partial ƞ<sup>2</sup> = 0.1). In the imaging results, there was a significant interaction of group by drug (p = 0.013, partial ƞ<sup>2</sup> = 0.13). OCD patients showed abnormally strong cingulate signaling of prediction errors during omission of an expected reward, with unexpected reduction by both pramipexole and amisulpride (p = 0.014, partial ƞ<sup>2</sup> = 0.26, 1-β error probability = 0.94). Exaggerated cingulate prediction error signaling to omitted reward in placebo was related to trait subjective difficulty in self-regulating behavior in OCD. Our data support cingulate dysfunction during reward processing in OCD, and bidirectional remediation by dopaminergic modulation, suggesting that exaggerated cingulate error signals in OCD may be of dopaminergic origin. The results help to illuminate the mechanisms through which dopamine receptor antagonists achieve therapeutic benefit in OCD. Further research is needed to disentangle the different functions of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists during bidirectional modulation of cingulate activation.",2019
Neural dynamics in co-morbid schizophrenia and OCD: A computational approach.,"The co-morbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia is higher than what would be expected by chance and the common underlying neuropathophysiology is not well understood. Repetitive stereotypes and routines can be caused by perseverative thoughts and motor sequences in both of these disorders. We extended a previously published computational model to investigate cortico-striatal network dynamics. Given the considerable overlap in symptom phenomenology and the high degree of co-morbidity between OCD and schizophrenia, we examined the dynamical consequences of functional connectivity variations in the overlapping network. This was achieved by focusing on the emergence of network oscillatory activity and examining parameter sensitivity. Opposing activity levels are present in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in schizophrenia and OCD. We found that with over-compensation of the primary pathology, emergence of the other disorder can occur. The oscillatory behavior is delicately modulated by connections between the OFC/ACC to the ventral and dorsal striatum and by the coupling between the ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Modulation on cortical self-inhibition (e.g. serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment) together with dopaminergic input to the striatum (e.g. anti-dopaminergic medication) has non-trivial complex effects on the network oscillatory behavior, with an optimal modulatory window. Additionally, there are several disruption mechanisms and compensatory processes in the cortico-striato-thalamic network which may contribute to the underlying neuropathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity in schizo-obsessive spectrum disorders. Our mechanistic model predicts that dynamic over-compensation of the primarily occuring neuropathophysiology can lead to the secondary co-morbid disease.",2019
Striatal dopamine regulates systemic glucose metabolism in humans and mice.,"The brain is emerging as an important regulator of systemic glucose metabolism. Accumulating data from animal and observational human studies suggest that striatal dopamine signaling plays a role in glucose regulation, but direct evidence in humans is currently lacking. We present a series of experiments supporting the regulation of peripheral glucose metabolism by striatal dopamine signaling. First, we present the case of a diabetes patient who displayed strongly reduced insulin requirements after treatment with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Next, we show that DBS in this striatal area, which induced dopamine release, increased hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in 14 nondiabetic patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Conversely, systemic dopamine depletion reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. Supporting these human data, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that striatal neuronal activity regulates systemic glucose metabolism.",2018
Effect of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) haplotypes on general psychopathology in patients with eating disorders.,"Among the many candidate genes analyzed in eating disorder (ED) patients, those involved in dopaminergic functions may be of special relevance, as dopamine is known to play a significant role in feeding behavior, the distortion of body image, hyperactivity and reward and reinforcement processes. We aimed to determine the effect of functional polymorphisms and haplotypes in the Dopamine Receptor D4 (DRD4) gene on general psychopathological symptoms in ED patients. Two-hundred-and-seventy-three ED patients [199 with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and 74 with Bulimia Nervosa (BN)] completed the SCL-90R inventory and were genotyped for four functional, clinically relevant DRD4 polymorphisms: three variants in the promoter region [120-bp tandem repeat (TR, long vs. short allele), C-616G and C-521 T] and a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in exon 3 (7R vs. non-7R allele). After correcting for multiple testing, none of the assayed polymorphisms were individually associated with SCL-90R results. Four DRD4 haplotypes (*1-*4) were detected in the patients with a frequency > 0.1. In the BN group, haplotype *2 (non7R-TR long-C-C) was associated with higher scores in the three global SCL-90R indices (GSI, PSDI and PST) after Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0.01 in all instances). Furthermore, carriers of this haplotype displayed higher scores (worst symptomatology) in Somatization, Obsessive-Compulsive, Anxiety, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation and the test additional items (p-values for the differences between carriers vs. non-carriers ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0110).

Altered serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in a mice model of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"There is ample evidence that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is based on reduced serotonergic function. Replicated bidirectional selection for thermoregulatory nest-building behavior in the laboratory house mouse (Mus musculus) resulted in compulsive-like, non-compulsive-like and randomly bred control mice that represent a non-induced animal model of OCD. The present study aimed at investigating the neurochemical patterns in specific brain regions of compulsive-like (HA) versus non-compulsive-like (LA) and normal (CA) mice. The neurochemical investigation of several brain regions of the corticostriato-thalamocortical circuity, i.e., nucleus caudatus (CPU), nucleus accumbens (NAc), globus pallidus (GP), hippocampus (HPC), amygdala (AM), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) was performed by electrochemical (serotonin and dopamine) and fluorescence (glutamate and GABA) HPLC detection. HA mice displayed significantly decreased 5-HT concentrations in the mPFC and LA mice displayed a significant increase in GABA concentrations in the mPFC. This supports the pathophysiological relevance of serotonin in the manifestation of OCD and adding to the construct validity of the non-induced mouse model of OCD.",2018
OCD candidate gene <i>SLC1A1</i>/EAAT3 impacts basal ganglia-mediated activity and stereotypic behavior.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, disabling condition with inadequate treatment options that leave most patients with substantial residual symptoms. Structural, neurochemical, and behavioral findings point to a significant role for basal ganglia circuits and for the glutamate system in OCD. Genetic linkage and association studies in OCD point to <i>SLC1A1</i>, which encodes the neuronal glutamate/aspartate/cysteine transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3)/excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAC1). However, no previous studies have investigated EAAT3 in basal ganglia circuits or in relation to OCD-related behavior. Here, we report a model of <i>Slc1a1</i> loss based on an excisable STOP cassette that yields successful ablation of EAAT3 expression and function. Using amphetamine as a probe, we found that EAAT3 loss prevents expected increases in (<i>i</i>) locomotor activity, (<i>ii</i>) stereotypy, and (<i>iii</i>) immediate early gene induction in the dorsal striatum following amphetamine administration. Further, <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice showed diminished grooming in an SKF-38393 challenge experiment, a pharmacologic model of OCD-like grooming behavior. This reduced grooming is accompanied by reduced dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor binding in the dorsal striatum of <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice. <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice also exhibit reduced extracellular dopamine concentrations in the dorsal striatum both at baseline and following amphetamine challenge. Viral-mediated restoration of <i>Slc1a1</i>/EAAT3 expression in the midbrain but not in the striatum results in partial rescue of amphetamine-induced locomotion and stereotypy in <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice, consistent with an impact of EAAT3 loss on presynaptic dopaminergic function. Collectively, these findings indicate that the most consistently associated OCD candidate gene impacts basal ganglia-dependent repetitive behaviors.",2017
Prazosin addition to fluvoxamine: A preclinical study and open clinical trial in OCD.,"The efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in psychiatric disorders may be ""augmented"" through the addition of atypical antipsychotic drugs. A synergistic increase in dopamine (DA) release in the prefrontal cortex has been suggested to underlie this augmentation effect, though the mechanism of action is not clear yet. We used in vivo microdialysis in rats to study DA release following the administration of combinations of fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg) and quetiapine (10 mg/kg) with various monoamine-related drugs. The results confirmed that the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (0.05 mg/kg) partially blocked the fluvoxamine-quetiapine synergistic effect (maximum DA increase dropped from 325% to 214%). A novel finding is that the α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin (1 mg/kg), combined with fluvoxamine, partially mimicked the effect of augmentation (maximum DA increase 205%; area-under-the-curve 163%). As this suggested that prazosin augmentation might be tested in a clinical study, we performed an open clinical trial of prazosin 20 mg addition to SRI in therapy-resistant patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder applying for neurosurgery. A small, non-significant reduction in Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores was observed in 10 patients and one patient was classified as a responder with a reduction in Y-BOCS scores of more than 25%. We suggest that future clinical studies augmenting SRIs with an α1-adrenergic blocker in less treatment resistant cases should be considered. The clinical trial ""Prazosin in combination with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for patients with Obsessive Compulsive disorder: an open label study"" was registered at 24/05/2011 under trial number ISRCTN61562706: http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN61562706.",2016
Symmetry symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder: clinical and genetic correlates.,"In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), symmetry-related symptoms may be important. Although clinical correlates of symmetry-related symptoms have been identified in OCD, few data exist on genetic associations. Animal studies indicate involvement of dopamine in symmetry-related behavior, suggesting this may be relevant to analogous symptoms in OCD. Alterations in dopamine may also reflect environmental influences. However, the association of symmetry-related symptomatology, early adversity, and polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes has not been investigated in OCD. Clinical information and polymorphisms in key dopaminergic genes were compared between OCD patients with primary symmetry symptoms and those without. OCD patients with primary symmetry symptoms comprised 46.6% (n=210) of the sample (n=451), and were older (p < 0.01), had longer illness duration (p < 0.01), higher OCD severity scores (p = 0.01), and greater comorbidity (p < 0.01) than those without. In Caucasians (n=343), genotype frequency differed significantly between groups for ANKK1 rs1800497, with more OCD patients with symmetry symptoms being homozygous for the A2 (CC) genotype (χ2 = 7.296; p = 0.026). Symmetry symptoms have some distinct clinical features and may represent a marker of severity in OCD. However, clinical associations, in combination with the association found with the ANKK1 rs1800497 A2 variant, suggest that primary symmetry symptoms may represent a distinctive clinical and psychobiological profile.",2016
Stereotypic behavior in nonhuman primates as a model for the human condition.,"Stereotypies that develop spontaneously in nonhuman primates can provide an effective model for repetitive stereotyped behavior in people with neurodevelopmental or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The behaviors are similar in form, are similarly affected by environmental conditions, and are improved with similar treatment methods such as enrichment, training, and drug therapy. However, because of a greater number of commonalities in these factors, nonhuman primates may serve as a better model for stereotyped behavior in individuals with autism or intellectual disability than for compulsions in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because animal models may not be exact in all features of the disorder being studied, it is important to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of using a nonhuman primate model for stereotyped behavior in people with psychological disorders.",2014

Obsessive-compulsive disorder: an integrative genetic and neurobiological perspective.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive thoughts and behaviours that are experienced as unwanted. Family and twin studies have demonstrated that OCD is a multifactorial familial condition that involves both polygenic and environmental risk factors. Neuroimaging studies have implicated the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit in the pathophysiology of the disorder, which is supported by the observation of specific neuropsychological impairments in patients with OCD, mainly in executive functions. Genetic studies indicate that genes affecting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, and the interaction between them, play a crucial part in the functioning of this circuit. Environmental factors such as adverse perinatal events, psychological trauma and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk genes and, hence, trigger the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive behaviours.",2014
"L-3,4-Dihydroxy-6-[F-18]fluorophenylalanine positron emission tomography demonstrating dopaminergic system abnormality in the brains of obsessive-compulsive disorder patients.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling neuropsychiatric disorder. Current treatment modalities, such as pharmacological and behavioral methods, are sometimes unsatisfactory. The mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway is supposed to have a role in the pathogenesis of OCD. In this study, L-3,4-Dihydroxy-6-[F-18]fluorophenylalanine (F-18 FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) is exploited to investigate the possible abnormality of dopaminergic neuronal circuits in the brains of OCD patients in vivo. The study subjects were recruited after psychological assessment and gave written informed consent to participate. The F-18 FDOPA PET scans were performed on five OCD patients and six healthy volunteers at 120 min after 185 MBq of F-18 FDOPA intravenous injection. The PET results were analyzed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping tool. Compared to the healthy subjects, the OCD brains showed increased dopaminergic metabolism in the left frontal premotor cortex (P < 0.001), along with trends toward an increase in the left posterior cingulate gyrus, the left cuneus, the left lingual gyrus, the right cuneus and precuneus, the right lingual gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, the left cerebellum, and the right cerebellum (P < 0.01). Our observations suggest that the increased dopaminergic neuronal function in these brain areas may be implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD.",2014
Deep brain stimulation induces striatal dopamine release in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic psychiatric disorder related to dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has recently become an effective treatment for therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, but its effect on dopaminergic transmission is unknown. We measured the effects of NAc DBS in 15 patients on the dopamine D2/3 receptor availability in the striatum with [(123)I]iodobenzamide ([(123)I]IBZM) single photon emission computed tomography. We correlated changes in [(123)I]IBZM binding potential (BP) with plasma levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and clinical symptoms. Acute (1-hour) and chronic (1-year) DBS decreased striatal [(123)I]IBZM BP compared with the nonstimulated condition in the putamen. BP decreases were observed after 1 hour of stimulation, and chronic stimulation was related to concurrent HVA plasma elevations, implying DBS-induced dopamine release. BP decreases in the area directly surrounding the electrodes were significantly correlated with changes in clinical symptoms (45% symptom decrease). NAc DBS induced striatal dopamine release, which was associated with increased HVA plasma levels and improved clinical symptoms, suggesting that DBS may compensate for a defective dopaminergic system.",2014
Stereotypies and behavioural medicine: confusions in current thinking.,"Stereotypies are defined as being repetitive, unvarying behaviours that appear to have no goal or function. This group of behaviours presents itself commonly in clinical behavioural practice. In recent companion animal behaviour literature the nomenclature has been changed to obsessive-compulsive disorder without considering the confusion this may create. Theories about the role endorphins play as a cause of stereotypies and an assumption about stereotypies playing a 'coping' role have been presented as scientific fact with little evidence supporting them. A failure to consider changes associated with stereotypy maturation and a reliance on anecdotal treatment success has lead to confusion regarding certain aspects of the development, diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. In this paper I present the idea that much of our confusion surrounding stereotypies is created by attempts to oversimplify a complex phenomenon.",2003
Association of beta-endorphin with specific clinical symptoms of depression.,"Abnormalities in plasma concentrations of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-endorphin) have been reported in depressed patients. This study was done to test the hypothesis that specific clinical characteristics of depression are associated with plasma beta-endorphin concentration. Plasma beta-endorphin was evaluated in 20 depressed patients diagnosed according to DSM-III-R and in 23 age- and sex-matched comparison subjects, and each was evaluated with the structured Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS). Twelve SADS items involving dysphoric mood and related symptoms were chosen for analysis. Within the group of all 43 subjects and within the depressed group, beta-endorphin level correlated significantly with psychic anxiety and with phobia. In the depressed group only, beta-endorphin also correlated significantly with obsessions/compulsions. Concentration of beta-endorphin was not significantly correlated with score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or Beck Depression Inventory or with scores on other SADS symptom items, including somatic anxiety, insomnia, subjective anger, overt anger, agitation, psychomotor retardation, panic attacks, appetite loss, or total weight loss. In the group of 23 comparison subjects, beta-endorphin did not correlate with Beck or Hamilton depression score or with any of the SADS clinical variables. High levels of plasma beta-endorphin may be associated with more severe anxiety, phobia, and obsessions/compulsions in depressed patients.",1992
"Immunoreactive beta-endorphin, cortisol, and growth hormone plasma levels in obsessive-compulsive disorder.","Basal morning plasma levels of immunoreactive-beta-endorphin (ir-beta-EP), cortisol, and growth hormone (GH) were assessed in 13 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients in comparison to 20 healthy controls. All subjects were drug free for at least 1 year. The mean plasma level of ir-beta-EP was significantly lower (36%) in the OCD patients when compared with the control subjects. The decrease in ir-beta-EP was not accompanied by alteration in cortisol and GH plasma levels.",1990
[The nature of the neurohormonal reorganizations in patients with neuroses].,"Neurohormonal balance was studied in patients suffering from neurasthenic, hysteric of obsessive-phobic neuroses. The peculiarities of functional restructuring in sympathoadrenal, opioid and pituitary-adrenal cortex systems were considered as related to clinical form or stage of the disease. Irrespective of the neurosis clinical form, a considerable rise in the endorphin blood levels with increasing sympathoadrenal and adrenocortical activities were typical of its initial stages. With long-lasting neuroses, the neurohormonal shifts characteristic of chronic emotional stress were detected.",1988

Altered glutamate concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with resting-state functional connectivity in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",2025
The relationship between oxidative stress markers and 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in obsessive compulsive disorder.,"The purpose of this study was to examine N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid complex (Glx)/Cr levels in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy controls' orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) method and to investigate their relationship with oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This study included patients with OCD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) ranging in age from 18 to 65. We used the ELISA method to evaluate serum SOD and GPx levels. Levels of NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus were measured using the 1H-MRS method. Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3 T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",2024
Glutamatergic abnormalities in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy: A controlled study.,"In this study, we utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to understand the role of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of OCD patients in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). In total, 54 patients with OCD and 54 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex were included in the study. They underwent MRS in the pgACC region to calculate the concentrations of Glu, Gln, GABA, and Glu + Gln (Glx). After quality control of the MRS data, 21 OCD and 21 HC were statistically analyzed. The severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale. The results indicate that patients with OCD present a disturbance in glutamatergic metabolism in the pgACC. The results also demonstrate that these changes correlate with the severity of compulsions.",2023
Cortical glutamate and GABA are related to compulsive behaviour in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and healthy controls.,"There has been little analysis of neurochemical correlates of compulsive behaviour to illuminate its underlying neural mechanisms. We use 7-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to assess the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by measuring glutamate and GABA levels in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) of healthy volunteers and participants with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Within the SMA, trait and clinical measures of compulsive behaviour are related to glutamate levels, whereas a behavioural index of habitual control correlates with the glutamate:GABA ratio. Participants with OCD also show the latter relationship in the ACC while exhibiting elevated glutamate and lower GABA levels in that region. This study highlights SMA mechanisms of habitual control relevant to compulsive behaviour, common to the healthy sub-clinical and OCD populations. The results also demonstrate additional involvement of anterior cingulate in the balance between goal-directed and habitual responding in OCD.",2023
Cerebellar gamma-aminobutyric acid: Investigation of group effects in neurodevelopmental disorders.,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are thought to arise in part from the disruption in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the brain. Recent evidence has shown the involvement of the cerebellum in cognition and affect regulation, and cerebellar atypical function or damage is reported frequently in NDDs. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have reported decreases in GABA in cortical brain areas in the NDDs, however, GABA levels in the cerebellum have not been examined. To determine possible group effects, we used a MEGA-PRESS acquisition to investigate GABA+ levels in a cerebellar voxel in 343 individuals (aged 2.5-22 years) with ASD, ADHD, OCD and controls. Using a mixed effects model, we found no significant differences between groups in GABA+ concentration. Our findings suggest that cerebellar GABA+ levels do not differentiate NDD groups.",2023
Effects of Gaba Derivatives on Anxious and Compulsive Behavior in Offspring of Rats with Experimental Preeclampsia.,"We studied the effects of GABA derivatives on anxious and compulsive behavior of progeny of rats with experimental preeclampsia provoked by replacement of drinking water for 1.8% NaCl solution from the first day of pregnancy to delivery. In comparison with progeny of health rats, the offspring of dams with complicated pregnancy demonstrated high level of anxiety and the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder both at the early (40 and 70 days) and late (6 and 12 months) stages of ontogeny. GABA derivatives succicard, salifen, and phenibut reduced symptoms of experimental preeclampsia in offspring of various age by decreasing the level of anxiety and reducing compulsive behavior. The efficacy of the examined derivatives was similar to that of the reference drug Pantogam.",2020
Pregabalin augmentation for resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder: a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.,"Glutamate dysfunction has been shown to be associated with pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our objective is to survey the effects of pregabalin (a glutamate-modulating agent) as an augmenting treatment for resistant OCD. In this 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 56 patients with resistant OCD were randomly allocated to receive either pregabalin or placebo plus their current medication (sertraline). Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to evaluate the outcomes. Adverse effects were also registered. Of the 56 patients with resistant OCD who were randomly allocated in 2 groups of pregabalin (n = 28) and placebo group (n = 28), 42 patients (22 in pregabalin group and 20 in placebo group) completed the trial. Throughout the trial, the mean score decreased from 26.13± 7.03 to 8.81 ± 3.47 in the pregabalin group (p < 0) and from 26.85 ± 4.34 to 17.63 ± 4.22 in the placebo group (p < 0). At the end of trial, 16 (57.14%) patients in the pregabalin group and 2 (7.14%) patients in the placebo group showed more than 35% decline in YBOCS (p < .01). The pregabalin group showed good tolerability and safety. Our study revealed that pregabalin, as an augmenting medication, is more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with resistant OCD.",2020
Investigation of anterior cingulate cortex gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate-glutamine levels in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common and disabling psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in an effort to provide a better understanding of the role of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pathophysiology of OCD. We hypothesized that beyond the separate effects of these neurotransmitter systems, a disruption in the balance between GABA and glutamate could be particularly relevant to OCD. We obtained MRS measures of GABA and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex from 23 adult patients with OCD and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy community volunteers. Established clinical rating scales were used to assess the severities of OCD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Statistical analysis involved the assessment of patient-control group differences in the individual measures of GABA and glutamate, as well as in the ratio of the GABA to glutamate measures. Additionally, we explored whether differences in the MRS measures existed between two subgroups of patients formed according to the severity of their OCD symptoms. Finally, we assessed the relations of demographic and clinical variables to the MRS measures. Patients with OCD displayed a higher estimated GABA level and a higher GABA to glutamate ratio than healthy participants, but no significant group differences were observed in the measure of glutamate. The MRS measures did not vary by subgroup and showed no correlations with demographic and clinical variables. These results indicate that GABA abnormalities within the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. The results fail to provide evidence that glutamate abnormalities alone are involved in adult OCD. Yet, it seems that a disruption in the balance between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission may have a particularly important role to play in OCD pathophysiology.",2019

Use of antiepileptic mood stabilizers in dermatology.,"Several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bipolar disorder (valproic acid, divalproex, lamotrigine, carbamazepine) and some cutaneous neuropathic pain syndromes (carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin). The AEDs may be effective in the management of (1) chronic pruritus, including pruritus due systemic disease, including uremia, neuropathic pain, neuropathic pruritus, and complex cutaneous sensory syndromes, especially where central nervous system (CNS) sensitization plays a role; (2) management of emotional dysregulation and the resultant repetitive self-excoriation or other cutaneous self-injury in patients who repetitively stimulate or manipulate their integument to regulate emotions (prurigo nodularis, lichen simplex chronicus, skin picking disorder, trichotillomania); (3) management of dermatologic clinical manifestations associated with autonomic nervous system activation (hyperhidrosis, urticaria, flushing; these often occur in conjunction with psychiatric disorders with prominent autonomic activation and dysregulation, eg, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder); and (4) when certain anticonvulsants have a direct therapeutic effect (eg, in psoriasis); currently the use of AEDs for such cases is largely experimental. Gabapentin (dosage range 300-3600 mg daily) is the most widely studied AED mood stabilizer in dermatology and is especially effective in situations where CNS sensitization is a mediating factor. Further larger-scale controlled studies of AEDs in dermatology are necessary.",2018
"Efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive gabapentin and memantine in obsessive compulsive disorder: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","In the search for additional pharmacologic treatments of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), the glutamatergic system is attracting growing interest. While adjuvant memantine to a standard medication with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) appears to reduce OCD symptoms, the adjuvant effect of gabapentin is less certain. The aim of the present randomized, double-blind and three-arm clinical trial was therefore to assess whether, compared to placebo, gabapentin (GAB) or memantine (MEM) adjuvant to a standard medication with an SSRI (fluoxetine; FLU) might lead to further improvements. A total of 99 outpatients (mean age: 29.59 years; 49.5% females) diagnosed with OCD were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: FLU + gabapentin (FLU + GAB); FLU + memantine (FLU + MEM); FLU + placebo (FLU + PLA). Experts rated patients' symptoms of OCD with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline, and 4 and 8 weeks later. YBOCS scores did not decrease over time. No group differences were observed. However, the significant Time by Group interaction showed that Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly over time in the FLU + PLA group. Response rates did not differ between the three study conditions. Typical side-effects were rash (FLU + MEM), drowsiness (FLU + GAB), anxiety (FLU + GAB; FLU + PLA), and drowsiness plus anxiety (FLU + GAB). The present pattern of results suggests that glutamatergic medications such as gabapentin and memantine adjuvant to a standard treatment with an SSRI have no additional positive impact on patients with OCD, as measured with the Y-BOCS. Additionally, side-effects were reported. Future studies should use more fine-grained tools to assess, for example, patients' sleep and cognitive functioning, and patients' view of symptoms.",2018
Altered serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in a mice model of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"There is ample evidence that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is based on reduced serotonergic function. Replicated bidirectional selection for thermoregulatory nest-building behavior in the laboratory house mouse (Mus musculus) resulted in compulsive-like, non-compulsive-like and randomly bred control mice that represent a non-induced animal model of OCD. The present study aimed at investigating the neurochemical patterns in specific brain regions of compulsive-like (HA) versus non-compulsive-like (LA) and normal (CA) mice. The neurochemical investigation of several brain regions of the corticostriato-thalamocortical circuity, i.e., nucleus caudatus (CPU), nucleus accumbens (NAc), globus pallidus (GP), hippocampus (HPC), amygdala (AM), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) was performed by electrochemical (serotonin and dopamine) and fluorescence (glutamate and GABA) HPLC detection. HA mice displayed significantly decreased 5-HT concentrations in the mPFC and LA mice displayed a significant increase in GABA concentrations in the mPFC. This supports the pathophysiological relevance of serotonin in the manifestation of OCD and adding to the construct validity of the non-induced mouse model of OCD.",2018
In vivo effects of ketamine on glutamate-glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Proof of concept.,"We previously reported the rapid and robust clinical effects of ketamine versus saline infusions in a proof-of-concept crossover trial in unmedicated adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study examined the concurrent neurochemical effects of ketamine versus saline infusions using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) during the clinical proof-of-concept crossover trial. Levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the excitatory neurochemicals glutamate+glutamine (Glx) were acquired in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), a region implicated in OCD pathology. Seventeen unmedicated OCD adults received two intravenous infusions at least 1 week apart, one of saline and one of ketamine, while lying supine in a 3.0 T GE MR scanner. The order of each infusion pair was randomized. Levels of GABA and Glx were measured in the MPFC before, during, and after each infusion and normalized to water (W). A mixed effects model found that MPFC GABA/W significantly increased over time in the ketamine compared with the saline infusion. In contrast, there were no significant differences in Glx/W between the ketamine and saline infusions. Together with earlier evidence of low cortical GABA in OCD, our findings suggest that models of OCD pathology should consider the role of GABAergic abnormalities in OCD symptomatology.",2015

Assessment of glutamate in striatal subregions in obsessive-compulsive disorder with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Glutamatergic signaling abnormalities in cortico-striatal circuits are hypothesized to lead to the repetitive thoughts and behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To test this hypothesis, studies have used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to measure glutamatergic compounds in the striatum of individuals with OCD. However, no studies have used methods that could measure glutamate minimally contaminated by glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in striatal subregions. Therefore, in this study, a proton MRS imaging (1H MRSI) technique with relatively high spatial resolution at 3.0 T was used to measure minimally contaminated glutamate levels in three striatal subregions (i.e., dorsal caudate, dorsal putamen, and ventral striatum) in 15 unmedicated adults with OCD and 16 matched healthy control subjects. No significant group differences in glutamate levels were found in any of the three striatal subregions. In contrast, a study in unmedicated pediatric OCD patients that measured glutamatergic compounds in the dorsal caudate by MRS at 1.5 T found significant elevations. Further studies are warranted to assess whether these discrepant MRS findings are due to differences in subject age or MRS methodology, or potentially are associated with glutamatergic gene variants implicated in OCD.",2015
Effects of mood stabilizers on marble-burying behavior in mice: involvement of GABAergic system.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent unwanted thoughts (obsessions), usually accompanied by repetitive behaviors (compulsions) intended to alleviate anxiety. Marble-burying behavior is a pharmacological model for study of OCD. In the present study, we examined the effects of mood stabilizers on marble-burying behavior in mice, as well as the role of GABA receptors in this behavior. The effects of treatment with valproate, carbamazepine, lithium carbonate, lamotrigine, muscimol and baclofen on marble-burying behavior in mice were evaluated. Valproate (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and carbamazepine (30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced marble-burying behavior without affecting total locomotor activity in ICR mice. Lamotrigine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly reduced marble-burying behavior in ddY mice. On the other hand, lithium carbonate (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced total locomotor activity without affecting marble-burying behavior in ddY mice. The selective GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1 mg/kg) significantly reduced marble-burying behavior without affecting total locomotor activity, whereas the selective GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (3 mg/kg) reduced total locomotor activity without affecting marble-burying behavior. Moreover, the selective GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (3 mg/kg) significantly counteracted the decrease in marble-burying induced by the administration of muscimol (1 mg/kg) and valproate (100 mg/kg). These results suggest that GABAergic mechanism is involved in marble-burying behavior, and that valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine reduce marble-burying behavior. Moreover, valproate reduces marble-burying behavior via a GABA(A) receptor-dependent mechanism.",2013
Investigation of cortical glutamate-glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid in obsessive-compulsive disorder by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Glutamatergic abnormalities in corticostriatal brain circuits are thought to underlie obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Whether these abnormalities exist in adults with OCD is not clear. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H MRS) to test our hypothesis that unmedicated adults with OCD have reduced glutamate plus glutamine (Glx) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with healthy controls. Levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were also explored. Twenty-four unmedicated adults with OCD and 22 matched healthy control subjects underwent ¹H MRS scans at 3.0 T. Resonances of both Glx and GABA were obtained using the standard J-editing technique and assessed as ratios relative to voxel tissue water (W) in the MPFC (the region of interest) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to explore the regional specificity of any finding. In the MPFC, Glx/W did not differ by diagnostic group (p=0.98) or sex (p=0.57). However, GABA/W was decreased in OCD (2.16±0.46 × 10⁻³) compared with healthy controls (2.43±0.45 × 10⁻³, p=0.045); moreover, age of OCD onset was inversely correlated with MPFC GABA/W (r=-0.50, p=0.015). MPFC GABA/W was higher in females than in males. In the DLPFC, there were no main effects of diagnosis or gender on Glx/W or GABA/W. These data indicate that unmedicated adults with OCD do not have Glx abnormalities in a MPFC voxel that includes the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. However, they may have decreased MPFC GABA levels. How GABA abnormalities might contribute to corticostriatal dysfunction in OCD deserves further study.",2012
"Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in primary care.","Anxiety disorders are frequently under-diagnosed conditions in primary care, although they can be managed effectively by general practitioners. This paper is a short and practical summary of the World Federation of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for the treatment in primary care. The recommendations were developed by a task force of 30 international experts in the field and are based on randomized controlled studies. First-line pharmacological treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for all disorders), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (for some) and pregabalin (for generalized anxiety disorder only). A combination of medication and cognitive behavior/exposure therapy was shown to be a clinically desired treatment strategy. This short version of an evidence-based guideline may improve treatment of anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD in primary care.",2012
Pregabalin augmentation in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder: a 16-week case series.,,2011
Pregabalin augmentation in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The therapeutic limitations of mainstay psychopharmacological treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) warrant the clinical testing of further add-on agents to improve patients' clinical symptoms. One such agent might be pregabalin, which has been found efficacious in other anxiety disorders. We report on the findings of a small, 8-week open-label trial of adjunctive pregabalin with a 4-week follow-up in 10 OCD patients resistant or only partial responders to a combination of serotonin reuptake inhibitors with atypical antipsychotics. Adjunctive pregabalin at 225-675 mg/d was well tolerated and led to patients' substantial improvement in their OCD symptoms, as reflected in their scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Despite the several limitations of the study, its results suggest that adjunctive pregabalin might be a safe and efficacious new augmentation agent in the treatment of drug-resistant OCD. We hypothesize that pregabalin's mechanism of action in OCD might consist in its inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission.",2011
"Cortical GABA, striatal dopamine and midbrain serotonin as the key players in compulsive and anxiety disorders--results from in vivo imaging studies.","Various factors are discussed in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, including dysfunctions of the (DA)ergic, serotonin (5-HT)ergic and GABAergic system. We assessed the contribution of the individual synaptic constituents by subjecting all available in vivo imaging studies on patients with anxiety disorders to a retrospective analysis. On a total of 504 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), phobia, or posttraumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) and 593 controls, investigations of VMAT2, DAT, SERT, D1, D2, 5-HTIA, 5-HT2A, GABA(A), and NK1 receptor binding in neostriatum, ventral striatum, thalamus, neocortex, limbic system, cingulate, midbrain/ pons or cerebellum were performed using either PET or SPECT. Separate analyses of the individual disorders showed significant decreases of striatal D2 receptors in OCD (-18%), mesencephalic SERT in OCD (-13%), frontocortical GABAA receptors in PD (-13%) and temporocortical GABAA receptors in GAD (-16%). Pooling of all disorders yielded a significant reduction of mesencephalic SERT (-13%), mesencephalic (-27%) as well as cingulate 5-HT1A receptors (-18%), striatal D2 receptors (-21%) and frontal (-14%), temporal (-14%), occipital (-13%) and cingulate GABAA receptors (-15%). The results show that DA, 5-HT, and GABA play a major role in all subtypes of anxiety disorders. In particular, the findings imply that the regulation state of DA as modulated by GABA and 5-HT may be crucial for the development of anxiety- and compulsion-related disorders. As GABA and 5-HT inhibit DAergic neurotransmission, the reductions of GABAA, 5-HT1A and SERT can be assumed to result in an enhanced activity of the mesolimbic DAergic system. This notion is also reflected by the decrease of striatal D2 receptor binding, which is indicative of an increased availability of synaptic DA.",2010

Anti-brain autoantibodies and altered excitatory neurotransmitters in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Although serum autoantibodies directed against basal ganglia (BG) implicate autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it is unclear whether these antibodies can cross the blood-brain barrier to bind against BG or other components of the OCD circuit. It is also unclear how they might lead to hyperactivity in the OCD circuit. We examined this by investigating the presence of autoantibodies directed against the BG or thalamus in the serum as well as CSF of 23 OCD patients compared with 23 matched psychiatrically normal controls using western blot. We further investigated CSF amino acid (glutamate, GABA, taurine, and glycine) levels and also examined the extent to which these levels were related to the presence of autoantibodies. There was evidence of significantly more binding of CSF autoantibodies to homogenate of BG as well as to homogenate of thalamus among OCD patients compared with controls. There was no significant difference in binding between patient and control sera except for a trend toward more bands to BG and thalamic protein corresponding to 43 kD among OCD patients compared with controls. CSF glutamate and glycine levels were also significantly higher in OCD patients compared with controls, and further multivariate analysis of variance showed that CSF glycine levels were higher in those OCD patients who had autoantibodies compared with those without. The results of our study implicate autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of OCD and also provide preliminary evidence that autoantibodies against BG and thalamus may cause OCD by modulating excitatory neurotransmission.",2009
"Pregabalin versus naltrexone in alcohol dependence: a randomised, double-blind, comparison trial.","Pregabalin (PRE) acts as a presynaptic inhibitor of the release of excessive levels of excitatory neurotransmitters by selectively binding to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. In this randomised, double-blind comparison trial with naltrexone (NAL), we aimed to investigate the efficacy of PRE on alcohol drinking indices. Craving reduction and improvement of psychiatric symptoms were the secondary endpoints. Seventy-one alcohol-dependent subjects were detoxified and subsequently randomised into two groups, receiving 50 mg of NAL or 150-450 mg of PRE. Craving (VAS; OCDS), withdrawal (CIWA-Ar) and psychiatric symptoms (SCL-90-R) rating scales were applied. Alcohol drinking indices and craving scores were not significantly different between groups. Compared with NAL, PRE resulted in greater improvement of specific symptoms in the areas of anxiety, hostility and psychoticism, and survival function (duration of abstinence from alcohol). PRE also resulted in better outcome in patients reporting a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Results from this study globally place PRE within the same range of efficacy as that of NAL. The mechanism involved in the efficacy of PRE in relapse prevention could be less related to alcohol craving and more associated with the treatment of the comorbid psychiatric symptomatology.",2010
Usher syndrome and psychiatric symptoms: a challenge in psychiatric management.,"Usher syndrome, the most common case of deaf - blindness, may be associated with various psychiatric disorders. Inability of communication through spoken language in association with progressive visual impairment affects diagnostics and management in case of co-morbidity with mental disorder. A patient with Usher syndrome and psychiatric symptoms is described and the difficulties in psychiatric assessment in her case are discussed. A 28 years old woman with hearing impairment diagnosed at the age of 3 months and progressive pigmentary retinopathy diagnosed at the age of 19 years, has been treated for ADHD in childhood, eating disorder in adolescence and psychosis-like disorder in adult life. Direct observation of patient behavior and the effects of pharmacotherapy were the main diagnostic procedures, since the use of sign language and handwriting was very limited. The limitations of management are discussed.",2009
Altered glutamate concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with resting-state functional connectivity in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",2025
Neurobiological differences in early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder: A study of the glutamatergic system based on functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"In this study, the combination of functional state magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) and cognitive tasks was used to conduct subgroup analyses on early-onset OCD (EO) and non-early-onset OCD (non-EO) and explore differences in the glutamatergic system and cognitive function among OCD subtypes. A total of 70 OCD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical evaluation and were subsequently divided into the EO or non-EO groups. Next, both resting and functional state MRS data were collected, with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) serving as the region of interest. Quantitative analysis of MRS data yielded precise neurometabolic concentrations, which were then statistically analyzed alongside inhibitory function, as measured by the Go-nogo task. The final analysis included 92 participants (22 EO-OCD, 41 non-EO OCD, and 29 HCs). EO-OCD patients had significantly higher Glx levels (p = 0.044) and lower GSH levels (p = 0.009) in the functional state compared to the non-EO group. Moreover, in the EO group, correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the functional state Glx levels and the average response time for errors in the nogo task (r = 0.526, p = 0.014). Additionally, resting-state GSH levels were positively correlated with total Y-BOCS scores (r = 0.854, p < 0.001). Overall, early-onset OCD may represent a distinct subtype that requires targeted interventions, as evidenced by the imbalance in the glutamatergic system observed in early-onset OCD patients. Additionally, in early-onset patients, Glx concentration during activation was related to cognitive impairment.",2025
Glutamate dynamics and BOLD response during OCD symptom provocation in the lateral occipital cortex: A 7 Tesla fMRI-fMRS study.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is linked with dysfunction in frontal-striatal, fronto-limbic, and visual brain regions. Research using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) suggests that altered neurometabolite levels, like glutamate, may contribute to this dysfunction. However, static neurometabolite levels in OCD patients have shown inconsistent results, likely due to previous studies' limited focus on neurometabolite dynamics. We employ functional MRS (fMRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore these dynamics and brain activation during OCD symptom provocation. We utilized a combined 7-tesla fMRI-fMRS setup to examine task-related BOLD response and glutamate changes in the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) of 30 OCD participants and 34 matched controls during an OCD-specific symptom provocation task. The study examined main effects and between-group differences in brain activation and glutamate levels during the task. A whole sample task-effects analysis on data meeting predefined quality criteria showed significant glutamate increases (n = 41 (22 OCD, 19 controls), mean change: 3.2 %, z = 3.75, p < .001) and task activation (n = 54 (26 OCD, 28 controls), p < .001) in the LOC during OCD blocks compared to neutral blocks. However, no differences in task-induced glutamate dynamics or activation between groups were found, nor a correlation between glutamate levels and task activation. We were able to measure task-induced increases in glutamate and BOLD levels, emphasizing its feasibility for OCD research. The absence of group differences highlights the need for further exploration to discern to what extent neurometabolite dynamics differ between OCD patients and controls. Once established, future studies can use pre-post intervention fMRS-fMRI to probe the effects of therapies modulating glutamate pathways in OCD.",2024
Quantification of Glutathione and Its Associated Spontaneous Neuronal Activity in Major Depressive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial antioxidant in the human brain. Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy sequence is highly recommended, limited literature has measured cortical GSH using this method in major psychiatric disorders. By combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we quantified brain GSH and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus and explored relationships between GSH levels and intrinsic neuronal activity as well as clinical symptoms among healthy control (HC) participants (n = 30), people with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 28), and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n = 28). GSH concentrations were lower in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in both the MDD and OCD groups than in the HC group. In the HC group, positive correlations were noted between GSH and glutamate levels and between GSH and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in both regions. However, while these correlations were absent in both patient groups, there was a weak positive correlation between glutamate and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Moreover, GSH levels were negatively correlated with depressive and compulsive symptoms in MDD and OCD, respectively. These findings suggest that reduced GSH levels and an imbalance between GSH and glutamate could increase oxidative stress and alter neurotransmitter signaling, thereby leading to disruptions in GSH-related neurochemical-neuronal coupling and psychopathologies across MDD and OCD. Understanding these mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the processes that underlie these disorders and potentially become a springboard for future directions and advancing our knowledge of their neurobiological foundations.",2025
New horizons for obsessive-compulsive disorder drug discovery: is targeting glutamate receptors the answer?,"Over the past decade, glutamate has emerged as a prominent focus in the field of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) pathophysiology. A convergence of evidence from genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies points to glutamatergic dysfunction as a key feature of this condition. In light of these findings, there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of glutamatergic agents in the treatment of OCD. This paper reviews the literature on glutamate transmission in OCD. In addition, the authors examine the results of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of glutamatergic agents in the treatment of OCD patients. Along with the recognition of neuroinflammation in the brain in OCD, the evidence of glutamate dysfunction represents one of the most promising recent discoveries for understanding the mechanisms involved in OCD. The importance of this discovery lies primarily in its pharmacological implications and has led to intense research activity in the field of glutamatergic agents. While this research has not yet had a substantial clinical impact, targeting glutamate receptors remains a promising horizon for the successful treatment of OCD patients.",2024
The relationship between oxidative stress markers and 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in obsessive compulsive disorder.,"The purpose of this study was to examine N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid complex (Glx)/Cr levels in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy controls' orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) method and to investigate their relationship with oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This study included patients with OCD (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) ranging in age from 18 to 65. We used the ELISA method to evaluate serum SOD and GPx levels. Levels of NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus were measured using the 1H-MRS method. Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3 T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",2024
Excoriation Disorder Is Characterized by Systemic Glutamatergic Dysfunction.,,2024
Glutamatergic abnormalities in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy: A controlled study.,"In this study, we utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to understand the role of glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of OCD patients in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). In total, 54 patients with OCD and 54 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex were included in the study. They underwent MRS in the pgACC region to calculate the concentrations of Glu, Gln, GABA, and Glu + Gln (Glx). After quality control of the MRS data, 21 OCD and 21 HC were statistically analyzed. The severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale. The results indicate that patients with OCD present a disturbance in glutamatergic metabolism in the pgACC. The results also demonstrate that these changes correlate with the severity of compulsions.",2023
Cortical glutamate and GABA are related to compulsive behaviour in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and healthy controls.,"There has been little analysis of neurochemical correlates of compulsive behaviour to illuminate its underlying neural mechanisms. We use 7-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to assess the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by measuring glutamate and GABA levels in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) of healthy volunteers and participants with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Within the SMA, trait and clinical measures of compulsive behaviour are related to glutamate levels, whereas a behavioural index of habitual control correlates with the glutamate:GABA ratio. Participants with OCD also show the latter relationship in the ACC while exhibiting elevated glutamate and lower GABA levels in that region. This study highlights SMA mechanisms of habitual control relevant to compulsive behaviour, common to the healthy sub-clinical and OCD populations. The results also demonstrate additional involvement of anterior cingulate in the balance between goal-directed and habitual responding in OCD.",2023
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Etiology, neuropathology, and cognitive dysfunction.","This review provides an overview of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms, including the four partially distinct subtypes of the disorder, current diagnostic criteria, and common comorbidities. Critically, it focuses on the etiology of OCD, including its underlying neuropathology, and examines cognitive dysfunction in OCD. This review study was conducted by library method. We show how dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits may underpin symptoms; and shed light on the putative neurochemistry within these loops such as the role of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate systems. We also show how OCD is characterized by cognitive dysfunction including problems in cognitive flexibility, visuospatial memory, response inhibition, and goal-directed behavior, linked to aberrant activity within CSTC circuits. In brief, research questions we shed light on include (1) what are the symptoms in OCD; (2) what is the etiology of the disorder and do existing models explain OCD; and (3) what are key cognitive deficits in OCD and do these improve with treatment?",2023
Direct changes of neurometabolic concentrations in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex among obsessive-compulsive patients after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment.,"Although Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a promising new noninvasive brain stimulation therapy, its underlying mechanisms of action remain unknown. OCD patients exhibit impaired response control and attention shifting, which is linked to some brain areas such as anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia. OCD patients also display altered neurometabolic concentrations in cortical cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC). In this study, we aimed to elucidate efficacy of rTMS treatment in alleviating related symptoms and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) neurometabolites. OCD patients were randomly divided into either drug (n = 23) or drug + rTMS (n = 29) groups, and those in the latter group subjected to 4-week rTMS treatment. All participants were visited twice, at baseline and follow-up after four weeks. During both visits, all patients were subjected to 1H-MRS, then Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Global Assessment Function (GAF) used to assess severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. We also evaluated synchronous anxiety and depression by Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D). After 4 weeks of treatment, patients in the Drug + rTMS group displayed significantly lower Y-BOCS (p = 0.038), BDI (p = 0.009), HAM-D (p = 0.013), HAM-A (p = 0.012) scores than their counterparts in the Drug group. Conversely, patients in the Drug + rTMS group had significantly higher tNAA concentrations (p = 0.030) than those in the Drug group. Notably, the Drug + rTMS group exhibited higher, but insignificant Glu (p = 0.055) and Glx (p = 0.068) concentrations compared to the Drug group. Partial correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between post HAM-A scores and 4-week change of pACC glutamate levels in the Drug + rTMS group (r = -0.434, p = 0.02). rTMS treatment is an efficacious treatment therapy for OCD, mainly by inducing changes in neurometabolites.",2023
Glutamatergic neurotransmission is affected by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the supplemental motor cortex of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction played key roles in pathophysiology. The current research assessed changes of neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of OCD patients receiving low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using 1H proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). 52 OCD patients were divided into rTMS treatment group (29) and the control group (medication only) (22). The levels of neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD were measured using MRS before and after treatment. All participants were taking medication prior to the treatment and the process. Following rTMS treatment, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was significantly decreased in the rTMS group compared with the control group. Glutamate (Glu) and glutamate and glutamine complexes (Glx) in the bilateral striatum of the rTMS treatment response group increased significantly with the improvement of OCD. Glu in the bilateral striatum and Glx in the right striatum were positively correlated with compulsion after the treatment. The physiopathological mechanism of OCD may be related to the glutamatergic dysfunction, and the low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the supplementary motor area can improve OCD symptoms by modulating glutamatergic levels in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD.",2023
Case Report: Possible autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder with postpartum onset.,"Autoimmune obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is rare. The case presented here is that of a female patient in her mid-thirties who developed postpartum OCD. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple juxtacortical hyperintensities that may have been post-inflammatory in origin. In tissue-based assays using mouse brain slices, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed novel anti-nucleoli autoantibodies in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical neurons. The CSF dopamine and glutamate concentrations were dysregulated. The clinical course and diagnostic findings were compatible with possible autoimmune OCD with postpartum onset.",2022
Longitudinal changes in neurometabolite concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex after concentrated exposure therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to its role in error processing, cognitive control and emotion regulation. OCD patients have shown altered concentrations in neurometabolites in the dACC, particularly Glx (glutamate+glutamine) and tNAA (N-acetylaspartate+N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate). We investigated the immediate and prolonged effects of exposure and response prevention (ERP) on these neurometabolites. Glx and tNAA concentrations were measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in 24 OCD patients and 23 healthy controls at baseline. Patients received concentrated ERP over four days. A subset was re-scanned after one week and three months. No Glx and tNAA abnormalities were observed in OCD patients compared to healthy controls before treatment or over time. Patients with childhood or adult onset differed in the change over time in tNAA (F(2,40) = 7.24, ɳ<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>= 0.27, p = 0.004): concentrations increased between one week after treatment and follow-up in the childhood onset group (t(39) = -2.43, d = -0.86, p = 0.020), whereas tNAA concentrations decreased between baseline and follow-up in patients with an adult onset (t(42) = 2.78, d = 1.07, p = 0.008). In OCD patients with versus without comorbid mood disorders, lower Glx concentrations were detected at baseline (t(38) = -2.28, d = -1.00, p = 0.028). Glx increased after one week of treatment within OCD patients with comorbid mood disorders (t(30) = -3.09, d = -1.21, p = 0.004). Our OCD sample size allowed the detection of moderate to large effect sizes only. ERP induced changes in neurometabolites in OCD seem to be dependent on mood disorder comorbidity and disease stage rather than OCD itself.",2022
Dorsal striatal dopamine induces fronto-cortical hypoactivity and attenuates anxiety and compulsive behaviors in rats.,"Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",2022
Developmental changes in fronto-striatal glutamate and their association with functioning during inhibitory control in autism spectrum disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) show overlapping symptomatology and deficits in inhibitory control, which are associated with altered functioning and glutamatergic signaling in fronto-striatal circuitry. These parameters have never been examined together. The purpose of the current study was to investigate functioning during inhibitory control and its association with fronto-striatal glutamate concentrations across these disorders using a multi-center, longitudinal approach. Adolescents with ASD (n = 24), OCD (n = 15) and controls (n = 35) underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions with a one-year interval. This included proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS; n = 74) and functional MRI during an inhibitory control task (n = 53). We investigated <sup>1</sup>H-MRS data and fMRI data separately as well as integrated in a multimodal analysis using linear models focusing on diagnosis and continuous measures of overlapping compulsivity symptoms. ACC glutamate was reduced over time in the ASD group compared with controls, while striatal glutamate decreased over time independent of diagnosis. Increased compulsive behavior seemed to be associated with increased striatal activity during failed inhibitory control. The integrated analyses showed differential involvement of increased striatal glutamate during failed but decreased striatal glutamate during successful inhibitory control in the OCD group compared to controls and ASD, suggesting different underlying mechanisms for OCD compared to ASD.",2021
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by structural and functional deficits in the cortico-striato-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry and abnormal neurochemical changes are thought to modulate these deficits. The hypothesis that an imbalanced concentration of the brain neurotransmitters, in particular glutamate (Glu) and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), could impair the normal functioning of the CSTC, thus leading to OCD symptoms, has been tested in humans using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET). This chapter summarises these neurochemical findings and represents an attempt to condense such scattered literature. We also discuss potential challenges in the field that may explain the inconsistent findings and suggest ways to overcome them. There is some convergent research from MRS pointing towards abnormalities in the brain concentration of neurometabolite markers of neuronal integrity, such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho). Lower NAA levels have been found in dorsal and rostral ACC of OCD patients (as compared to healthy volunteers), which increase after CBT and SSRI treatment, and higher Cho concentration has been reported in the thalamus of the OCD brain. However, findings for other neurometabolites are very inconsistent. Studies have reported abnormalities in the concentrations of creatine (Cr), GABA, glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), Ins (myo-inositol), and serotonin (5-HT), but most of the results were not replicated. The question remains whether the NAA and Cho findings are genuinely the only neurochemical abnormalities in OCD or whether the lack of consistent findings for the other neurometabolites is caused by the lower magnetic field (1-3 Tesla (T)) used by the studies conducted so far, their small sample sizes or a lack of proper control for medication effects. To answer these questions and to further inform the biological underpinning of the symptoms and the cognitive problems at the basis of OCD we need better controlled studies using clear medicated vs unmedicated groups, larger sample sizes, stronger magnetic fields (e.g. at 7 T), and more consistency in the definition of the regions of interest.",2021
Neurochemical correlates of behavioral treatment of pediatric trichotillomania.,"Trichotillomania (TTM) is a chronic and impairing psychiatric disorder with suspected dysfunctional cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit activity reflecting excitatory/inhibitory signaling imbalance. TTM neurochemistry is understudied, with no prior research using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This pilot investigation examined associations between TTM diagnosis, symptom severity, and response to behavioral treatment with MRS neurometabolites glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in CSTC structures. Proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) MRS was acquired from bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and proximal white matter in 10 unmedicated girls with TTM, ages 9-17 years, before and after treatment, and from 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Nine of 10 TTM patients were treatment responders. Pretreatment mean Glu and GABA did not differ significantly between participants and controls. Pretreatment TTM symptoms were correlated with Glu in (left + right) pACC (r = 0.88, p = 0.02) and thalamus (r = 0.82, p = 0.012), and were negatively correlated with pACC GABA (r = -0.84, p = 0.034). Mean GABA in putamen increased 69% (baseline to post-treatment) (p = 0.027). Higher pretreatment Glu in caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus predicted greater symptom decreases with treatment (all r < -0.6, p < 0.05); higher caudate GABA predicted less treatment-related symptom decline (r = 0.86, p = 0.014). Small sample, GABA quantified with spectral fitting rather than editing. Consistent with other neuroimaging, MRS reveals discrete CSTC chemical changes with effective behavior therapy, and possibly with TTM etiology. TTM symptoms relate to excess excitatory versus inhibitory signaling in pACC and thalamus; symptom improvement may reflect reduced excitatory drive of the CSTC direct-pathway activity.",2020
Analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with obsessive<b>-</b>compulsive disorder comorbid skin<b>-</b>picking disorder.,"To investigate the neurobiochemical characteristics of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comorbid skin-picking disorder (SPD), and to provide reference for the pathophysiological basis for OCD. We examined the levels of glutamate and other neurochemicals in ACC of 30 adult OCD patients (13 with comorbid SPD, 17 without SPD), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) at 3T. The clinical evaluation and the quantitative analysis of metabolites were carried out in the two groups. OCD patients with comorbid SPD showed significantly lower ACC glutamate than the patients without SPD (<i>P</i>=0.001). In all OCD patients, glutamate was negatively correlated with scores of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (<i>r</i>=-0.55, <i>P</i>=0.002). Moreover, the ACC glutamate of female patients was correlated with the total score of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (<i>r</i>=0.69, <i>P</i>=0.041) in the OCD with comorbid SPD patients. Alterations of the glutamate content in the ACC are involved in the pathophysiological process of OCD with comorbid SPD, which provides evidence for the study on the pathogenesis of OCD and SPD.",2020
Reduced anterior cingulate glutamate of comorbid skin-picking disorder in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by hyperactivity in a network of forebrain structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Convergent evidence suggests that glutamatergic dysfunction may contribute to the disorder. Skin picking disorder (SPD) was listed as one of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, which is often comorbid with OCD and share overlapping phenomenology and pathophysiology. However, potential confounding effects between the two diagnostic effects on neurotransmitter levels remain largely unexamined. We examined the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) glutamate and other neurochemicals in 62 subjects using a single-voxel acquisition 1H MRS at 3Tesla; of these, 47 subjects yielded usable measurements of both glutamate and glutamine and were included in the analysis (17 medicated with OCD alone, 13 medicated with comorbid OCD + SPD, 17 healthy control). OCD with comorbid SPD showed significantly lower pACC glutamate than in patients without SPD (p = 0.001) or control subjects (p = 0.035). OCD without SPD subjects showed pACC glutamate levels indistinguishable from controls (p = 0.501). In the OCD with SPD subjects, glutamate was correlated with Y-BOCS total score in female patients (n = 9, r = 0.69, p = 0.041). The main limitation of the study was the cross-sectional data. Our patients were on SSRI medication which may have modified the effect of SPD and OCD interaction on glutamate activity. Our results suggest that alterations of the glutamatergic system may play an important role in the pathophysiology of a subgroup of OCD and reduced pACC glutamate may be a biomarker of a distinct subset of OCD patients.",2020
Effects of glutamate-related drugs on anxiety and compulsive behavior in rats with obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"<b>Objective</b>: Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We examined the effects and potential mechanism of glutamate-related drugs on compulsive behavior in quinpirole (QNP)-sensitized rats, to deepen our understanding of the link between OCD and glutamate.<b>Method</b>: This study systematically compared the effects of the partial NMDA agonist D-Cycloserine and the NMDA antagonist NVP-AAMO77, Ro25-6981 on compulsive behavior using the elevated zero maze, open field, and marble burying tests in QNP-induced OCD model.<b>Results</b>: The competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists NVP-AAMO77 (5 mg/kg) and Ro25-6981 (5 mg/kg) significantly inhibited anxiety-like and compulsive behavior in rats. And D-Cycloserine at all doses showed significant suppression on anxiety-like and marble-burying behavior. Glutamic acid (Glu) levels, reflecting changes in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, were significantly decreased in rat hippocampus of the NVP-AAMO77 and D-Cycloserine-treated group compared to the saline-treated group. The levels of other amino acids were unaffected. Moreover, NVP-AAMO77 significantly decreased the expression of the subunit NR2A of the NMDAR, and Ro25-6981 suppressed the level of the subunit NR2B of the NMDAR, while D-Cycloserine decreased both the subunit NR2A and NR2B of the NMDAR.<b>Conclusion</b>: Collectively, these findings suggest a functional role of NMDARs in anxiety and compulsive behaviors, with NMDARs inhibition promoting anxiolytic-like and anti-compulsive responses. These findings suggest that D-cycloserine, NVP-AAMO77, and Ro25-6981 could be useful drugs for the treatment of OCD, which may be due to the suppression of NR2A- or NR2B- containing NMDAR.",2020
Is glutamate associated with fear extinction and cognitive behavior therapy outcome in OCD? A pilot study.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure and response prevention is a well-established treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is based on the principles of fear extinction. Fear extinction is linked to structural and functional variability in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and has been consistently associated with glutamate neurotransmission. The relationship between vmPFC glutamate and fear extinction and its effects on CBT outcome have not yet been explored in adults with OCD. We assessed glutamate levels in the vmPFC using 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and fear extinction (learning and recall) using skin conductance responses during a 2-day experimental paradigm in OCD patients (n = 17) and in healthy controls (HC; n = 13). Obsessive-compulsive patients (n = 12) then received manualized CBT. Glutamate in the vmPFC was negatively associated with fear extinction recall and positively associated with CBT outcome (with higher glutamate levels predicting a better outcome) in OCD patients. Glutamate levels in the vmPFC in OCD patients were not significantly different from those in HC, and were not associated with OCD severity. Our results suggest that glutamate in the vmPFC is associated with fear extinction recall and CBT outcome in adult OCD patients.",2020
Investigation of anterior cingulate cortex gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate-glutamine levels in obsessive-compulsive disorder using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common and disabling psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in an effort to provide a better understanding of the role of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pathophysiology of OCD. We hypothesized that beyond the separate effects of these neurotransmitter systems, a disruption in the balance between GABA and glutamate could be particularly relevant to OCD. We obtained MRS measures of GABA and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex from 23 adult patients with OCD and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy community volunteers. Established clinical rating scales were used to assess the severities of OCD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Statistical analysis involved the assessment of patient-control group differences in the individual measures of GABA and glutamate, as well as in the ratio of the GABA to glutamate measures. Additionally, we explored whether differences in the MRS measures existed between two subgroups of patients formed according to the severity of their OCD symptoms. Finally, we assessed the relations of demographic and clinical variables to the MRS measures. Patients with OCD displayed a higher estimated GABA level and a higher GABA to glutamate ratio than healthy participants, but no significant group differences were observed in the measure of glutamate. The MRS measures did not vary by subgroup and showed no correlations with demographic and clinical variables. These results indicate that GABA abnormalities within the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. The results fail to provide evidence that glutamate abnormalities alone are involved in adult OCD. Yet, it seems that a disruption in the balance between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission may have a particularly important role to play in OCD pathophysiology.",2019
Brain neurochemistry in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder patients and effects of 12-week escitalopram treatment: <sup>1</sup> H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.,"The purpose of this study was to examine treatment-related neurochemical changes in 28 unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients using <sup>1</sup> H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup> H-MRS). We included subjects diagnosed with OCD (n = 28), each with a total duration of illness of less than 5 years, as a study group and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 26). The inclusion criteria for the OCD group were right-handed individuals aged 18 years or older who had not been on any specific treatment for OCD for the last at least 8 weeks and who had no other psychiatric comorbidity. A pre-post and case-control design was employed in which OCD patients underwent <sup>1</sup> H-MRS at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment with escitalopram (n = 21). Clinical assessment was carried out using a semi-structured pro forma Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 before and after treatment. Volume-localized <sup>1</sup> H-MRS was carried out with a 3-Tesla Philips MR scanner. Our data suggested higher levels of myoinositol (mI), total choline (tCho), and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) in the medial thalamus at pre-assessment in OCD subjects as compared to healthy controls and a significant reduction in tCho and Glx after treatment in OCD subjects. The mI levels in the caudate nucleus and Glx levels in the anterior cingulate cortex were significantly correlated with disease severity on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Our study supports the hypothesis of a hyper-glutaminergic state (as suggested by increased Glx levels) and neurodegeneration (as suggested by increased tCho and mI in the thalamus) in cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuitry in OCD patients as suggested by previous studies using MRS as well as other functional imaging studies.",2019

Large nesting expression in deer mice remains stable under conditions of visual deprivation despite heightened limbic involvement: Perspectives on compulsive-like behavior.,"Visual stimuli and limbic activation varyingly influence obsessive-compulsive symptom expression and so impact treatment outcomes. Some symptom phenotypes, for example, covert repugnant thoughts, are likely less sensitive to sensory stimuli compared to symptoms with an extrinsic focus, that is, symptoms related to contamination, safety, and ""just-right-perceptions."" Toward an improved understanding of the neurocognitive underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive psychobiology, work in naturalistic animal model systems is useful. Here, we explored the impact of visual feedback and limbic processes on 24 normal (NNB) and large (LNB) nesting deer mice, respectively (as far as possible, equally distributed between sexes). Briefly, after behavioral classification into either the NNB or LNB cohorts, mice of each cohort were separated into two groups each and assessed for nesting expression under either standard light conditions or conditions of complete visual deprivation (VD). Nesting outcomes were assessed in terms of size and neatness. After nesting assessment completion, mice were euthanized, and samples of frontal-cortical and hippocampal tissues were collected to determine serotonin and noradrenaline concentrations. Our results show that LNB, as opposed to NNB, represents an inflexible and excessive behavioral phenotype that is not dependent on visually guided action-outcome processing, and that it associates with increased frontal-cortical and hippocampal noradrenaline concentrations, irrespective of lighting condition. Collectively, the current results are informing of the neurocognitive underpinnings of nesting behavior. It also provides a valuable foundation for continued investigations into the noradrenergic mechanisms that may influence the development and promulgation of excessive, rigid, and inflexible behaviors.",2024
"Cerebrospinal fluid findings in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and PANDAS: A systematic literature review.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) are related mental disorders that share genetic, neurobiological, and phenomenological features. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a neuropsychiatric autoimmune disorder with symptoms of OCD and/or TS associated with streptococcal infections. Therefore, PANDAS represents a strong link between OCD, TS, and autoimmunity. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses can provide insight into the central nervous processes in OCD, TS, and PANDAS. A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA criteria was conducted to collect all CSF studies in patients with OCD, TS, and PANDAS. The total number of cases and the heterogeneity of the low number of studies were not sufficient for a meta-analysis to provide a high level of evidence. Nevertheless, meta-analytical statistics could be performed for glutamate, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (degradation product of serotonin), homovanillic acid (degradation product of dopamine), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (major metabolite of noradrenaline), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in OCD. A risk-of-bias assessment was implemented using the Cochrane ROBINS-E tool. Meta-analytical testing identified elevated glutamate levels in the CSF of OCD patients compared with healthy controls, while no significant differences were found in other neurotransmitters or CRH. Single studies detected novel neuronal antibodies in OCD patients and elevated oligoclonal bands in TS patients. For TS and PANDAS groups, there was a dearth of data. Risk of bias assessment indicated a substantial risk of bias in most of the included studies. This systematic review of available CSF data shows that too few studies are currently available for conclusions with good evidence. The existing data indicates glutamate alterations in OCD and possible immunological abnormalities in OCD and TS. More CSF studies avoiding sources of bias are needed.",2024
"Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.",2023
Central norepinephrine transmission is required for stress-induced repetitive behavior in two rodent models of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive behaviors exacerbated by stress. Many OCD patients do not respond to available pharmacotherapies, but neurosurgical ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can provide symptomatic relief. Although the ACC receives noradrenergic innervation and expresses adrenergic receptors (ARs), the involvement of norepinephrine (NE) in OCD has not been investigated. To determine the effects of genetic or pharmacological disruption of NE neurotransmission on marble burying (MB) and nestlet shredding (NS), two animal models of OCD. We assessed NE-deficient (Dbh -/-) mice and NE-competent (Dbh +/-) controls in MB and NS tasks. We also measured the effects of anti-adrenergic drugs on NS and MB in control mice and the effects of pharmacological restoration of central NE in Dbh -/- mice. Finally, we compared c-fos induction in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ACC of Dbh -/- and control mice following both tasks. Dbh -/- mice virtually lacked MB and NS behaviors seen in control mice but did not differ in the elevated zero maze (EZM) model of general anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological restoration of central NE synthesis in Dbh -/- mice completely rescued NS behavior, while NS and MB were suppressed in control mice by anti-adrenergic drugs. Expression of c-fos in the ACC was attenuated in Dbh -/- mice after MB and NS. These findings support a role for NE transmission to the ACC in the expression of stress-induced compulsive behaviors and suggest further evaluation of anti-adrenergic drugs for OCD is warranted.",2020
[Treatment-resistant anxiety disorders: A literature review of drug therapy strategies].,"Anxiety disorders are widespread psychiatric conditions with significant social and professional disability, poor quality of life, an increased risk of suicide, and frequent attendance of medical services. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) have demonstrated a rather robust efficacy for the treatment of most of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless a substantial number of patients are resistant or still suffer from residual symptoms despite this first line treatment. The objective of our paper is to review relevant studies for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders resistant to the first line treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a pubmed/medline search for double-blind placebo-controlled trials of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. An adequate trial for a SRI in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should continue for at least 12 weeks. Special considerations of the comorbidities and symptom profile could help in the choice of an appropriate pharmacotherapy. Several trials have highlighted the efficacy of antipsychotics as an add-on to SRI in treatment-resistant OCD such as haloperidol more so when comorbid with a tic disorder, or risperidone that can reduce OCD as well as depressive symptoms. Aripiprazole has been shown efficacious in two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, while the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine remains controversial. Other trials showed some efficacy of anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, topiramate), pindolol, memantin and N-acetylcystein as an adjunctive treatment to SRI for resistant OCD. Few trials have investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or SNRI resistant generalized anxiety disorder showing a failure of adjunctive therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and risperidone. These studies were underpowered and very limited in number. Adjunctive risperidone for resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed benefit in some but not all trials. Olanzapine was beneficial for the reduction of the CAPS score in addition to the improvement of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, prazosin was efficacious by reducing PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and psychological distress. One double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate treatment-resistant social phobia showing no benefit of pindolol add-on paroxetine. Our results demonstrate that the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders is not sufficiently investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, despite a growing evidence in favor of antipsychotics and some other pharmacological agents in resistant OCD and, to a lesser extent, PTSD. Hence, there is a crucial need for larger double-blind placebo-controlled trials for resistant anxiety disorders. Finally, being out of the scope of our review, we omitted studies of non-pharmacologic therapies.",2015
Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with cortisol changes.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but its mechanism of action is largely unknown. Since DBS may induce rapid symptomatic changes and the pathophysiology of OCD has been linked to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, we set out to study whether DBS affects the HPA axis in OCD patients. We compared a stimulation ON and OFF condition with a one-week interval in 16 therapy-refractory OCD patients, treated with DBS for at least one year, targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We measured changes in 24-h urinary excretion of free cortisol (UFC), adrenaline and noradrenaline and changes in obsessive-compulsive (Y-BOCS), depressive (HAM-D) and anxiety (HAM-A) symptom scores. Median UFC levels increased with 53% in the OFF condition (from 93 to 143nmol/24h, p=0.12). There were no changes in urinary adrenaline or noradrenaline excretion. The increase in Y-BOCS (39%), and HAM-D (78%) scores correlated strongly with increased UFC levels in the OFF condition. Our findings indicate that symptom changes following DBS for OCD patients are associated with changes in UFC levels.",2013
"Disgust affects TNF-alpha, IL-6 and noradrenalin levels in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.","Neurobiological research of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has rarely taken in account the context dependent evocation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. To bypass this obstacle, this study investigated neurobiological parameters during a standardized disgust provocation paradigm in patients with OCD and healthy controls. Ten OCD patients and 10 healthy controls were exposed to 9 disgust related items using a standardized provocation paradigm. Catecholamines and cortisol in plasma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by peripheral leucocytes were assessed along with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, disgust, and anxiety levels using Visual Analogue Scales prior, during and after a provocation paradigm. Noradrenalin levels increased, while LPS stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 by peripheral leucocytes decreased during exposure to disgust related objects in OCD patients but not in healthy controls. Cortisol levels were not affected by exposure neither in patients nor in controls, but overall cortisol levels of OCD patients were increased compared to controls. In conclusion, our data suggests that symptom provocation in OCD patients with contamination fear is accompanied by alterations in the immune and neuroendocrine systems but does not affect cortisol levels.",2010
CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and neuropsychiatric symptomatology in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"Patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) may exhibit certain neuropsychiatric symptomatology, possibly related to alterations in central neurotransmitter activity. The aim of this study was to relate psychiatric distress, as expressed by the scores in the SCL-90 subscales, to CSF levels of the main metabolites of noradrenaline (MHPG), serotonin (5-HIAA), and dopamine (HVA) in NPH patients. The metabolite levels were estimated in CSF samples taken during the tap test in 19 patients with probable NPH, and compared to 19 sex- and age-matched controls. Cognitive impairment was evaluated by the MMSE. Compared to controls, NPH patients had similar MHPG and 5-HIAA levels, and significantly elevated HVA levels, a notable difference from patients with dementias. There were no significant correlations of metabolite levels to the scores in the nine SCL-90 subscales. MMSE score was not related either to metabolite levels, or to the SCL-90 subscale scores. Patients scored higher than controls in most SCL-90 subscales, more pronounced being the difference in obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Serotonergic neurotransmitter activity seems not to be altered in NPH patients, and this may explain the reported lack of beneficial effect of serotonergic drugs for obsessive-compulsive symptoms in NPH patients.",2009
"[Tourette syndrome. Genetics, neuroanatomy and neurotransmitters].","The etiology and pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome (TS) have not yet been clarified. Despite inconsistencies in the literature, some conclusions can be drawn on genetics, neuroanatomy and neurotransmitters. The inheritance of TS is unknown; the etiology seems to be polygenic. The basal ganglia are probably smaller in patients with TS. A dysfunction in the dopaminergic pathway causes tics. ADHD results from a decreased concentration of dopamine and an increased concentration of noradrenaline. OCD is caused by a dysfunction in serotonin and probably dopamine.",2008

SSRIs and SNRIs: broad spectrum of efficacy beyond major depression.,"Originally studied and introduced for the treatment of depression, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have proven effective for a broad range of psychiatric illnesses, including several anxiety disorders, bulimia, and dysthymia. These drugs have in common important effects on the serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission system, which is involved in mediating a substantial number of important functions, including mood, aggression, sexual behavior, and pain. In addition, some of the new antidepressants, like venlafaxine/venlafaxine XR, also have effects on the noradrenergic neurotransmission system, which also appears important in mood and anxiety disorders. These new drugs, because of their specificity for the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake proteins, lack most of the adverse side effects of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Consequently, in addition to being the usual first-line treatments for major depression, they are also first-line for panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and bulimia. They may also be the best medication treatments for dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder. Further advances in psychopharmacology will be driven by discoveries from brain imaging and molecular biological research.",1999
Cardiovascular and catecholamine response to orthostasis in panic and obsessive-compulsive disorder and normal controls: effects of anxiety and novelty.,"Studies of the cardiovascular and catecholamine response to orthostatic challenge in panic disorder patients have yielded conflicting results. Failure to control for the effects of both anxiety and novelty, which contribute to subjects' response to orthostatic challenge in control patients, could possibly account for this. The blood pressure, pulse, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine responses to orthostasis were examined in patients with panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (to control for nonspecific anxiety effects), and controls, on two separate days a week apart (to control for novelty). All measures showed robust and significant increases with orthostatic challenge that were generally similar across groups. Pressure responses were greater on average on the first compared with the second day and panic disorder patients had higher plasma norepinephrine levels throughout the study and a diminished diastolic blood pressure response on the first day. These findings in general support the absence of consistent peripheral autonomic nervous system differences in response to orthostatic challenge in panic disorder patients.",1997
Elevated cerebrospinal fluid corticotropin-releasing factor in Tourette's syndrome: comparison to obsessive compulsive disorder and normal controls.,"Stress- and anxiety-related fluctuations in tic severity are cardinal features of Tourette's syndrome (TS), and there is evidence for involvement of noradrenergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology and treatment of the disorder. To examine further the pathobiology of this enhanced vulnerability to stress and anxiety, we measured central activity of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in patients with TS and the related condition, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained in a standardized fashion for measurement of CRF from 21 medication-free outpatients with TS, 20 with OCD, and 29 healthy controls. The TS patients had significantly higher levels of CSF CRF than both the normal controls and the OCD patients. However, there was no difference in CSF CRF between the OCD patients and the normal controls. Group differences in CSF CRF were unrelated to current clinical ratings of depression, anxiety, tics, and obsessive compulsive behaviors. Although the functional significance of this finding remains to be elucidated, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that stress-related neurobiological mechanisms may play a role in the pathobiology of TS.",1996
Serotonin dysfunction disorders: a behavioral neurochemistry perspective.,"The spectrum of efficacy of the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs continues to expand. In fact, no psychiatric syndrome seems to worsen with these agents, and few studies fail to demonstrate clinical improvement in some patients, regardless of any nosologic nicety, such as precise DSM diagnosis. This suggests that the biological rubric of psychopathology is dimensional rather than categorical. New research using in vivo microdialysis shows differences in neurochemistry among SSRIs, wherein fluoxetine blocks reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as serotonin, in medial prefrontal cortex, and fluvoxamine has a relatively more selective neurochemical profile. In the animal model of learned helplessness, which is a biobehavioral model for stress-induced anxiety causing depression, the SSRIs including fluvoxamine prevent helplessness. From these and other data, a neurotransmitter balance theory of biopsychopathology is formulated. In this hypothetical construct, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA modulate thought, anxiety, and mood, respectively. Serotonin is a stabilizing agent, which assists in returning the mind to its homeostatic setpoint.",1996
[Selected issues of biological aspects of eating disorders].,"This paper reviews the recent progress in the understanding of the neurobiology of the eating disorders. The analysis of the biochemical abnormalities present in the patients with bulimia nervosa indicates the decrease of central serotonin and noradrenalin activity, elevation of the levels of cerebrospinal fluid peptide YY, alterations of the endogenous opioids and also reduction of peripheral cholecystokinin levels. As these studies were performed on patients who were actively binging and purging it is conceivable that the above abnormalities can results from a pathological feeding pattern. It is also suggested that the reduction of central serotoninergic activity is the stable, trait-related dysregulation of neurotransmitter system activity. In patients with anorexia nervosa the endocrine disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes were thoroughly studied. Underweight anorectic patients have been found to have elevations of cerebrospinal fluid level of neuropeptide Y, corticotropin releasing hormone and vasopressin as well as reductions of beta-endorphin and oxytocin level. However, most of the neuropeptide alterations normalize following weight recovery. The only exception is a persistent increase of central serotonin activity postulated to be responsible for the obsessive-compulsive personality traits and disturbed eating behaviors found in these patients.",1994

Plasma catecholamines and their metabolites in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Plasma catecholamines and their metabolites were sampled in 13 medication-free patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 29 normal controls. In addition to severe OCD symptoms, the patients had significantly higher anxiety, tension, and resting pulse rates than the controls. Nonetheless, mean plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), the catecholamine metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and the stress-related hormone cortisol did not differ between OCD patients and normal controls. When the patients and control populations were combined and average plasma NE and E levels calculated over 35 min, subjects with a higher mean NE output (greater than 1.1 pm/ml) had higher Profile of Mood States depression scores than subjects with a low NE output (less than 1.1 pm/ml). Altogether, these results indicate that elevated plasma catecholamine measures are not likely to be associated with the pathophysiology of OCD.",1991
Noradrenergic function in obsessive-compulsive disorder: behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to clonidine and comparison to healthy controls.,"To evaluate noradrenergic (NE) function in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine responses to the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine were examined in 18 patients with OCD and 10 healthy subjects. Subjects received single i.v. doses of 2 micrograms/kg of clonidine administered under double-blind, placebo-controlled, random-assignment conditions. Following clonidine, but not following placebo, patients transiently experienced a significant reduction of obsessions and compulsions. Significant drowsiness and a reduction in anxiety were also noted, but the antiobsessional effect appeared independent of the soporific and antianxiety effects. Growth hormone (GH), cortisol, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol responses to clonidine did not differentiate patients from healthy controls. Blood pressure and pulse in response to clonidine did not differ between groups. Improvement in OCD symptoms after clonidine significantly correlated with GH response to clonidine, suggesting specific noradrenergic mediation. This finding lends only partial support for a primary defect of noradrenergic function in OCD.",1991
[The L-DOPA test in patients with obsessive fear neurosis].,"Three groups of patients with morbid fear neurosis, dissimilar in prevailing of either adrenaline or noradrenaline excretion, were identified using the complex method of sympathoadrenal system (SAS) examination. The test with 0.1 g L-DOPA loading demonstrated the high rate of synthesis and high reactivity of SAS in the first two groups with the adrenal type of SAS functioning as well as an increased hydroxylation in the course of synthesis of catecholamines. These anomalies were accompanied by impairments of adrenaline metabolism in the second group. A decreased reactivity of SAS in morning crises and elevated reactivity--during day and evening crises were observed in the third group of patients, characterized by the noradrenaline type of the system functioning as well as by presence of noradrenaline crises.",1988
Biochemical changes during clomipramine treatment of childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Peripheral measures of serotonergic and noradrenergic function were obtained in 29 obsessive-compulsive adolescents and 31 age- and sex-matched controls, as well as in a subsample of 22 patients after five weeks of treatment with clomipramine hydrochloride (134 +/- 33 mg/d) (mean +/- SD) given in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Drug-free obsessive-compulsive subjects did not differ from controls on measures of platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, nor on plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine concentrations at rest and after a standard orthostatic challenge procedure. Compared with placebo, treatment with clomipramine was clinically effective and produced a marked decrease in platelet serotonin concentration, a trend toward a reduction in platelet MAO activity, and a rise in standing plasma norepinephrine. Clinical improvement during drug therapy was closely correlated with pretreatment platelet serotonin concentration and MAO activity, as well as with the decrease in both measures during clomipramine administration. This suggests that the effects of clomipramine on serotonin uptake may be essential to the antiobsessional action observed.",1987
Biological alterations in the primary affective disorders and other tricyclic-responsive disorders.,"Noradrenergic function was studied in patients with primary affective disorder and other tricyclic-responsive disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa and panic attack/agoraphobia in medication-free states. Pre-synaptic noradrenergic activity was assessed by assaying plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite 3-methoxy,4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). Noradrenergic receptor responsiveness was evaluated by measuring plasma growth hormone (GH), MHPG, and NE responses to clonidine. Binding of tritiated dihydroergocriptine (3H-DHE) and biochemical responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were measured in platelet preparations. These studies suggest that noradrenergic activity may be altered in several tricyclic-responsive disorders and are consistent with the possibility that tricyclic antidepressants may serve to stabilize a dysregulated noradrenergic system in patients from several diagnostic categories.",1985
Growth hormone response to clonidine in obsessive-compulsive patients.,"We have observed a lesser growth hormone response to intravenous clonidine administration in nine obsessive-compulsive disorder patients meeting research diagnostic criteria than in nine matched controls. The obsessive-compulsive disorder patients had higher plasma free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and plasma norepinephrine levels before clonidine than the controls. As blunted growth hormone responses to clonidine are also characteristic of affective disorder patients, these results support other observations of a psychobiologic affinity between these two groups and are also compatible with an association between increased presynaptic noradrenergic activity and decreased post-synaptic receptor responsiveness.",1983
[Types of adrenograms in neuroses].,"A total of 714 adrenograms (graphic depiction of adrenalin and noradrenalin excretion in relation to the circadian rhythm) obtained from neurotic patients were analyzed. The authors succeeded in ascertaining the differences of their types in patients suffering from hysterical neurosis, neurasthenia and obsessive neurosis. The adrenographic method is believed to be capable of serving as an additional diagnostic criterion in the differential diagnosis of these pathological forms.",1983

Serotonergic underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequent and disabling condition, with many patients being treatment-resistant. Improved understanding of its neurobiology is vital for better therapies. Evidence is still conflicting regarding specific serotonergic-related dysfunctions in OCD. We systematically reviewed the literature to provide a quantitative assessment of the role of serotonin (5-HT) in patients with untreated OCD through imaging. We searched for neuroimaging studies investigating central 5-HT tonus in unmedicated patients with OCD, excluding studies comprising treated patients to prevent bias from antidepressant-induced changes in serotonergic tonus. We also conducted a meta-analysis using a homogeneous group of positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography articles that compared 5-HT transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A receptor (HT2AR) binding potential in different brain regions of patients with untreated OCD and healthy controls. The systematic review encompassed 18 articles, with 13 included in the subsequent meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed by a revised form of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We provided standardized mean difference (SMD) values for SERT and 5-HT2AR binding potential measures across 15 different brain regions. Patients with OCD showed lower SERT binding potential in the brainstem (SMD = -1.13, 95% CI [-1.81 to -0.46]), midbrain (SMD = -0.54, 95% CI [-0.92 to -0.16]), and thalamus/hypothalamus regions (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI [-0.99 to -0.18]) with neglectable to moderate heterogeneity. By combining results from 2 decades of molecular imaging studies, we show that individuals with OCD exhibit lower SERT binding potential in specific brain regions, providing compelling evidence of a 5-HT system dysfunction. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain elusive. The limitations include heterogeneity across studies in populations, imaging techniques, and radiotracer usage.",2025
Unveiling serotonergic dysfunction of obsessive-compulsive disorder on prefrontal network dynamics: a computational perspective.,"Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",2024
Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and brain lesions compatible with multiple sclerosis.,"Autoimmune-mediated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can occur in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, a well-studied case study of a patient with OCD and MS-compatible diagnostic findings is presented. The 42-year-old female patient had displayed OCD symptoms for 6 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses detected an increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, and a positive MRZ reaction. Neopterin was increased, but sarcoidosis was excluded. In the absence of neurological attacks and clues for MRI-based dissemination in time, a radiologically isolated syndrome, the pre-disease stage of MS, was diagnosed. Neurotransmitter measurements of CSF detected reduced serotonin levels. In the absence of visible strategic demyelinating lesions within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes. Serotonin abnormalities in MS should be studied further, as they could potentially explain the association between neuroinflammation and mental illnesses.",2024
Arbitration between model-free and model-based control is not affected by transient changes in tonic serotonin levels.,"Serotonin has been suggested to modulate decision-making by influencing the arbitration between model-based and model-free control. Disruptions in these control mechanisms are involved in mental disorders such as drug dependence or obsessive-compulsive disorder. While previous reports indicate that lower brain serotonin levels reduce model-based control, it remains unknown whether increases in serotonergic availability might thus increase model-based control. Moreover, the mediating neural mechanisms have not been studied yet. The first aim of this study was to investigate whether increased/decreased tonic serotonin levels affect the arbitration between model-free and model-based control. Second, we aimed to identify the underlying neural processes. We employed a sequential two-stage Markov decision-task and measured brain responses during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 98 participants in a randomized, double-blind cross-over within-subject design. To investigate the influence of serotonin on the balance between model-free and model-based control, we used a tryptophan intervention with three intervention levels (loading, balanced, depletion). We hypothesized that model-based behaviour would increase with higher serotonin levels. We found evidence that neither model-free nor model-based control were affected by changes in tonic serotonin levels. Furthermore, our tryptophan intervention did not elicit relevant changes in Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent activity.",2024
Serotonergic agonism and pharmacologically-induced adolescent stress cause operant-based learning deficits in mice.,"The interplay between environmental stress and genetic factors is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the relative contribution of these causative antecedents in the manifestation of cognitive inflexibility-a phenotype often seen in obsessive-compulsive (OC)- spectrum disorders-is not fully understood. In this study, we treated mice with 50 mg/L corticosterone (CORT, a glucocorticoid stress hormone) in their drinking water during adolescence. In adulthood, we assessed anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity; along with operant-based discrimination and reversal learning. RU-24969, a selective serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonist, was used as an acute pharmacological model of OC-like behaviour. RU-24969 (5 mg/kg) was administered prior to each reversal learning testing session. We found that acute treatment with 5 mg/kg RU-24969 induced stereotyped hyperlocomotion in vehicle- and CORT-treated mice. Furthermore, pre-treatment with CORT in adolescence produced subtle anxiety-like behaviour in adult mice, and also resulted in an impairment to late-stage discrimination learning and alterations to reversal learning. Finally, acute treatment with 5 mg/kg RU-24969 caused an impairment to early-stage reversal learning. Whilst we revealed dissociable detrimental effects of adolescent CORT treatment and acute 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonism on discrimination and reversal learning, respectively, we did not find evidence of additive deleterious effects of these two treatments. We therefore suggest that while disrupted serotonergic signalling is likely to be involved in the cognitive phenotype of OC-spectrum disorders, distinct neuropathological pathways may be at play in mediating the role of stress as an antecedent in OCD and related illnesses.",2024
Efficacy and safety of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists in augmentation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of moderate to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common mental disorder, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the cornerstone of its pharmacological treatment. About 40-60% of the cases are treatment-refractory, and this makes searching for second-line treatment necessary. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonists are among the many medications that have been used in augmentation with SSRIs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in augmentation with SSRIs in treating moderate to severe OCD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar for relevant trials published up to December 2022. The effect size was the mean difference in Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) scores before and after receiving 5-HT3 receptor antagonist drugs in augmentation with SSRIs in moderate to severe OCD patients. We included 6 randomized-controlled trails (RCTs) with 334 patients assessing the effect of the augmentation of SSRIs with ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron on treating moderate to severe OCD. Our results were in favor of the experimental group in total (Z = 8.37, P < 0.00001), in the compulsion subgroup (Z = 5.22, P < 0.00001), and in the obsession subgroup (Z = 8.33, P < 0.00001). They are well-tolerated, and have mild side effects and do not result in withdrawal. Augmentation of 5-HT3 antagonists with SSRIs can be beneficial in treating moderate to severe OCD. Further multi-center trials under adequate conditions in longer periods are needed to help come up with a comprehensive action plan.",2023
Structural and functional brain imaging after treatment with selective-serotonin reuptake-inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A mini review.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder whose etiopathogenesis, according to various neuroimaging studies, seems to be linked to selective dysfunctions in regions within the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuit. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line therapy for OCD but their neurobiological effects on the brain is only partially understood. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight structural and functional brain imaging modifications induced by SSRIs treatment. A literature search on PubMed, Psych-Info and Embase database was performed. Studies including patients with OCD that analyzed the effect of SSRIs through structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging were selected. Seven relevant studies were considered eligible for the present review. Overall, the results of the reviewed studies showed that SSRIs treatment seems to normalize structural, in terms of the white matter and gray matter volumes, and functional activity alterations observed in OCD patients, especially in regions within the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The poor design of the studies, the small and heterogeneous samples, differences in age, gender, illness course, comorbidities, treatment protocols and the different magnetic fields used make it difficult to generalize the results. From the available evidence it emerged that SSRIs treatment has proven to be effective in normalizing brain structural and functional alterations observed in OCD patients. However, future neuroimaging investigations should focus on long-term effects of drugs on brain structure and function in OCD patients through longitudinal approaches in order to identify more effective treatments for these patients.",2024
"Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.",2023
Effect of psilocybin on marble burying in ICR mice: role of 5-HT1A receptors and implications for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Preliminary clinical findings, supported by preclinical studies employing behavioral paradigms such as marble burying, suggest that psilocybin may be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the receptor mechanisms implicated in the putative anti-obsessional effect are not clear. On this background, we set out to explore (1) the role of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying; (2) the effect of staggered versus bolus psilocybin administration and persistence of the effect; (3) the effect of the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone, on marble-burying and the head twitch response (HTR) induced by psilocybin, a rodent correlate of psychedelic effects. Male ICR mice were administered psilocybin 4.4 mg/kg, escitalopram 5 mg/kg, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) 2 mg/kg, M100907 2 mg/kg, buspirone 5 mg/kg, WAY100635 2 mg/kg or combinations, intraperitoneally, and were tested on the marble burying test. HTR was examined in a magnetometer-based assay. The results show that (1) Psilocybin and escitalopram significantly reduced marble burying. The effect of psilocybin was not attenuated by the 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907. The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, reduced marble burying as did the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was additive to that of psilocybin, but that of buspirone was not. The 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone but not the effect of psilocybin. (2) Psilocybin injections over 3.5 h had no effect on marble burying and the effect of bolus injection was not persistent. (3) Co-administration of buspirone with psilocybin blocked its effect on HTR. These data suggest that neither 5-HT2A nor 5-HT1A receptors are pivotally implicated in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying. Co-administration with buspirone may block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin without impeding its anti-obsessional effects.",2023
Psychedelics as Transformative Therapeutics.,"Over the past decade, psychedelic compounds have emerged as potentially transformative therapeutics for a variety of intractable neuropsychiatric conditions. However, historically most of the basic science has utilized these compounds as probes to interrogate various endogenous neurotransmitter systems-mainly the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. With the renewed interest in utilizing these compounds as therapeutics and the explosion in clinical trials, psychedelics have been purported to treat many neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, cluster headaches, migraines, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is therefore imperative to understand the biology and pharmacology behind their therapeutic mechanisms as well as expose any potential pitfalls in their widespread use as treatments. This review covers the latest advances in understanding the biological mechanisms, the newest efforts in drug discovery, and potential pitfalls when it comes to utilizing this class of compounds as emerging therapeutics.",2023
"Granisetron-mediated augmentation of sertraline therapeutic effect in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.","Medications currently recommended for the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) usually relieve the severity of symptoms by as much as 20-30%, and satisfactory treatment is obtained in 40-60% of patients with OCD. Nevertheless, the remaining symptoms continue to impair the patients' function. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate possible strategies to improve the mitigation of symptoms. In this study, the main objective was to examine and investigate the effectiveness of granisetron, which is a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) antagonist, as an adjunct therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for the purpose of ameliorating OCD symptoms. fifty-eight patients diagnosed with OCD, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, who had a Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) score of more than 21 were recruited in a double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 10 weeks to receive either granisetron (1 mg twice daily) and sertraline (100 mg daily initially followed by 200 mg daily after week 4) or placebo and sertraline. The primary outcome was OCD symptoms measured by the Y-BOCS. Y-BOCS total score significantly dropped in both groups (28.9 to 17.7 for granisetron plus sertraline and 27.5 to 19.3 for placebo plus sertraline group with a slightly greater drop for granisetron plus sertraline group), while the granisetron plus sertraline group experienced a significantly greater reduction in obsession scores (Greenhouse-Geisser F(2.32,97.57) = 4.52,p-value = 0.01). Moreover, in comparison with the placebo plus sertraline group, the proportion of the patients showing complete response was considerably higher among the granisetron plus sertraline group (P-value < 0.01). No major adverse effects were observed in any of the groups. The results suggest that granisetron augmentation of sertraline may increase the rate of response in patients with moderate to severe non-refractory OCD. Further studies are suggested in this regard.",2022
Possible Toxic Serotonin Syndrome in an Adolescent With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Precipitated by Esomeprazole.,,2022
Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD.,"Effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments are well established for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are first-line treatment and are of benefit to about half of patients. Augmentation of SRI treatment with low-dose neuroleptics is an evidence-based second-line strategy. Specialty psychotherapy is also used as both first-line and second-line treatment and can benefit many. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to these treatments. New alternatives are urgently needed. This review summarizes evidence for these established pharmacotherapeutic strategies, and for others that have been investigated in refractory disease but are not supported by the same level of evidence. We focus on three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We summarize evidence from genetic, neuroimaging, animal model, and other lines of investigation that probe these three systems in patients with OCD. We also review recent work on predictors of response to current treatments. While many studies suggest abnormalities that may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, most studies have been small, and non-replication of reported findings has been common. Nevertheless, the gradual accrual of evidence for neurotransmitter dysregulation may in time lead the way to new pharmacological strategies.",2021
"The effects of acute serotonin challenge on executive planning in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), their first-degree relatives, and healthy controls.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by executive function impairment and by clinical responsivity to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Executive planning deficits constitute a candidate endophenotype for OCD. It is not known whether this endophenotype is responsive to acute serotonin manipulation. The study aimed to investigate the effects of acute SSRI administration on executive function in patients with OCD, first-degree relatives of patients with OCD, and healthy controls. A randomized double-blind cross-over study assessed the effects of single-dose escitalopram (20 mg) and placebo on executive planning in 24 patients with OCD, 13 clinically unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with OCD, and 28 healthy controls. Performance on a Tower of London task measuring executive planning was assessed 4 h after oral administration of the pharmacological challenge/placebo and compared across and within groups using a mixed model analysis of variance. On the outcome measure of interest, i.e., the mean number of choices to obtain the correct solution, there was a marginally significant effect of group (F(2, 59) = 3.1; p = 0.052), with patients (least square (LS) mean 1.43; standard error [SE] 0.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31-1.55) and their relatives (LS mean 1.46; SE 0.08; 95% CI, 1.30-1.62) performing worse than matched healthy controls (LS mean 1.26; SE 0.05; 95% CI, 1.15-1.37) on placebo. There was a trend towards a significant group × treatment interaction (F(2, 58) = 2.8, p = 0.069), with post hoc tests showing (i) patients (p = 0.009; LS mean difference 0.23; SE 0.08) and relatives (p = 0.03; LS mean difference 0.22; SE 0.10) were more impaired compared to controls and (ii) escitalopram was associated with improved executive planning in patients with OCD (p = 0.013; LS mean difference 0.1; SE 0.04), but not other groups (both p > 0.1; controls: LS mean difference - 0.03; SE 0.04; relatives: LS mean difference 0.02; SE 0.05). Our findings are consistent with a view that there is impaired executive planning in OCD and that this constitutes a behavioural endophenotype. In patients with OCD, but not in relatives, acute SSRI administration ameliorated this deficit. Further investigation is needed to understand common and differential involvement of neurochemical systems in patients with OCD and their relatives.",2020
"A comparative, single-blind, randomized study on quetiapine and aripiperazole augmentation in treatment of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder, of unknown etiology, that affects 2.5% of the population. An appropriate therapeutic response to conventional treatment is seen. Some studies use augmentative treatment by antipsychotics, glutamatergic, lithium, buspirone, and others agents to improve the therapeutic response. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole and quetiapine as augmentative treatments in patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) refractory OCD. The OCD patients were initially treated for 12 weeks with a SSRI. If after 12 weeks their Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score was more than 16, they were randomly assigned to either the aripiprazole or the quetiapine augmentation group for an additional 12 weeks. There were no significant differences in age, sex, education, marital status, or score of Y-BOCS and Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) between groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05) at the outset of the study. Significant differences were noted after 1 month when compared with results at 2, 3, and 4 months in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Both quetiapine and aripiprazole may be effective and well-tolerated augmentative agents in the treatment of SSRI-refractory OCD. Because of positive results, aripiprazole may be considered more effective and may have a more rapid onset in terms of therapeutic response.",2020
"Serotonin system genes and hoarding with and without other obsessive-compulsive traits in a population-based, pediatric sample: A genetic association study.","Hoarding, originally only considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is now categorized as a separate disorder in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). We studied candidate serotonergic genes and the distinctness of hoarding in children and adolescents and hypothesized that unique gene variants would be associated with hoarding alone. We examined obsessive-compulsive (OC) traits, including hoarding, in a total of 5,213 pediatric participants in the community. We genotyped candidate serotonin genes (5-HTTLPR polymorphism in SLC6A4 for 2,018 individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] across genes SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR1B for 4,711 individuals). In a previous study conducted by our group in the same sample, we identified a significant association between 5-HTTLPR and hoarding in males. In this study, we examined hoarding more closely by testing the association between serotonin gene variants and hoarding traits with and without other accompanying OC traits. The [L<sub>G</sub> +S] variant in 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with hoarding alone in males (p-value of 0.009). There were no significant findings for 5-HTTLPR in females. There were no significant findings after correction for multiple comparisons using SNP array data, but top SNP findings suggested that variation downstream of HTR1B may be implicated in hoarding alone in females. Our results suggest specific serotonin gene variants are associated with hoarding traits alone, differing between sexes. Top findings are in line with our former study, suggesting that individuals with hoarding alone were driving previous results. Our paper supports hoarding disorder's new designation.",2020
Effect of Escitalopram on Serum GDNF and BDNF Levels and 5-HT Level of Brain Tissue of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Rats.,"The present study aims to discuss the effect of escitalopram in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in obsessive-compulsive disorder rats. A total of 42 rats were divided into three groups randomly: control group (n = 14), model group (n = 14) (obsessive-compulsive disorder group), and escitalopram group (n = 14) (model + obsessive-compulsive disorder group + escitalopram treatment). The open-field method was used to test the rat behavior, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the serum GDNF and BDNF levels. In addition, Western blot was used to determine the brain tissue protein levels of GDNF and BDNF and high-performance liquid chromatography + electrochemistry method to determine the 5-HT level of brain tissue. Visiting place was changed, rotational frequency and fixed duration enhanced in escitalopram group compared to model group (P < 0.05). Besides, GDNF and BDNF levels of serum and brain tissue were decreased in model group and escitalopram group compared to control group (P < 0.05), while GDNF and BDNF levels of serum and brain tissue were increased in escitalopram group compared to model group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the 5-HT level of brain tissue in escitalopram group was higher than that in model group (P < 0.05). Escitalopram could increase GDNF and BDNF levels and 5-HT content in serum and brain tissue in obsessive-compulsive disorder rats, which contributes to a function on the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.",2020
"Serotonin system genes and obsessive-compulsive trait dimensions in a population-based, pediatric sample: a genetic association study.","Serotonin system genes are commonly studied in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but genetic studies to date have produced inconsistent results, possibly because phenotypic heterogeneity has not been adequately accounted for. In this paper, we studied candidate serotonergic genes and homogenous phenotypic subgroups as presented through obsessive-compulsive (OC) trait dimensions in a general population of children and adolescents. We hypothesized that different serotonergic gene variants are associated with different OC trait dimensions and, furthermore, that they vary by sex. Obsessive-compulsive trait dimensions (Cleaning/Contamination, Counting/Checking, Symmetry/Ordering, Superstition, Rumination, and Hoarding) were examined in a total of 5,213 pediatric participants in the community using the Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (TOCS). We genotyped candidate serotonin genes (directly genotyping the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in SLC6A4 for 2018 individuals and using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data for genes SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR1B for 4711 individuals). We assessed the association between variants across these genes and each of the OC trait dimensions, within males and females separately. We analyzed OC traits as both (a) dichotomized based on a threshold value and (b) quantitative scores. The [L<sub>G</sub> + S] variant in 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with hoarding in males (p-value of 0.003 and 0.004 for categorical and continuous analyses, respectively). There were no significant findings for 5-HTTLPR in females. Using SNP array data, there were significant findings for rumination in males for HTR2A SNPs (p-value of 1.04e-6 to 5.20e-6). This represents the first genetic association study of OC trait dimensions in a community-based pediatric sample. Our strongest results indicate that hoarding and rumination may be distinct in their association with serotonin gene variants and that serotonin gene variation may be specific to sex. Future genetic association studies in OCD should properly account for heterogeneity, using homogenous subgroups stratified by symptom dimension, sex, and age group.",2019
Serotonin system gene variants and regional brain volume differences in pediatric OCD.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is phenotypically heterogeneous and genetically complex. This study aimed to reduce heterogeneity using structural brain imaging to study putative intermediate phenotypes for OCD. We hypothesized that select serotonin gene variants would differ in their relationship with brain volume in specific regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits between OCD patients and controls. In a total of 200 pediatric subjects, we genotyped candidate serotonin genes (SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR1B, and HTR2C) and conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to measure regional brain volumes within CSTC circuits. In males and females separately, we first tested the association between serotonin gene variants and OCD and the effect of serotonin gene variants on brain volume irrespective of diagnosis. We then carried out a series of analyses to assess the effect of genotype-diagnosis interaction on brain volume. In females, but not in males, we identified a statistically significant genotype-diagnosis interaction for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTR2C, rs12860460 (interaction term estimate of 5.45 cc and interaction P value of 9.70e-8) and rs12854485 (interaction term estimate of 4.28 cc and interaction P value of 2.07e-6). The tested allele in each SNP was associated with decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volume in controls and with increased ACC volume in OCD patients. Our findings suggest that, in females, sequence variation in HTR2C influences ACC volume in pediatric OCD. The variants may contribute to differences in ACC volume and to OCD in a sex-specific manner when acting together with other genetic, biological, and/or environmental factors.",2020
Double Blind Controlled Study of Adding Folic Acid to Fluoxetine in the Treatment of OCD.,"Folate is important for the synthesis of serotonin the neurotransmitter which plays a main role in OCD. We, therefore, explored the efficacy of folic acid as add on treatment to fluoxetine in a double blind study among patients with OCD. A double blind, 12-week study comparing the efficacy of folic acid as add on treatment and placebo in patients with OCD was conducted on thirty six (36) patients. Patients were randomly assigned to folic acid (5 mg/day) or placebo group in addition to fluoxetine (40 mg/day). After the baseline assessment, on week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 assessments were performed by using YBOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A and CGI-S. Serum folate, erythrocyte folate, serum homocysteine and B<sub>12</sub> levels were measured both baseline and the end of study. A mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA on Y-BOCS scores were used to determine the difference between folic acid and placebo groups. No significant differences were found in the ratios of gender or in the mean age, serum folic acid level, erythrocyte folate level, serum homocysteine level and serum B<sub>12</sub> level between the treatment groups at the baseline. Consecutively scores collected over six measurements on YBOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A and CGI showed non-significant differences between folic acid and placebo groups. None of the biological markers of one carbon metabolism were associated with the change in YBOCS scores. It may be assumed that there is no beneficial effect of folic acid addition to fluoxetine in the treatment of OCD.",2019
Celecoxib potentiates the antianxiety and anticompulsive-like activity of fluoxetine against chronic unpredictable mild stress in experimental animals.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is considered a heterogeneous anxiety disorder that includes compulsions. Celecoxib is considered an adjuvant to fluoxetine in the management of OCD in a clinical study. However, the experimental evidence is yet to be established. Therefore, the antianxiety and anticompulsive-like activity of celecoxib (20 mg/kg, orally) was evaluated in the presence or absence of fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, orally) in mice who were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 14 consecutive days. Seven-day treatment of celecoxib significantly attenuated the CUMS-induced anxiety in open-field, hole-board, elevated plus maze tests, and compulsion in the marble-burying test. Celecoxib significantly reversed the CUMS-induced decrease and increase in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) in the prefrontal cortex, and attenuated the CUMS-induced increase in the levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the prefrontal cortex. Celecoxib also potentiated the anxiolytic, anticompulsive, serotonergic, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activity of 7-day treatment with fluoxetine in CUMS-challenged animals compared with their monotherapy. Thus, it can be speculated that the combination of an anti-inflammatory agent with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor could be a better therapeutic option in the management of stress-related disorders including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant OCD.",2019
Role of sleep deprivation in the causation of postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"First-onset or recurrence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is common after childbirth. Postpartum OCD can occur alone or in combination with other psychiatric disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders. Putative etiological mechanisms involve consideration of genetic factors, alterations in the serotonin system secondary to changes in levels of gonadal hormones, rise in oxytocin, hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis hyperactivity, and neuroinflammation. Sleep deprivation arising from a host of diverse factors is common after delivery in women with postpartum OCD. The author suggests that sleep deprivation may play a critical role in the etiology of postpartum OCD. Clinical and research implications of this hypothesis are discussed.",2019
Relationship Between Neuroanatomical and Serotonergic Hypotheses of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Combined Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Evoked Potential Study.,"The so-called neuroanatomical hypothesis (with an increased activity of orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]) and the serotonergic hypothesis (with low activity in this system) have been discussed regarding the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for decades. This study aimed to look for a relationship between the 2 pathogenetic concepts. Nineteen OCD patients (8 female, 11 male, mean ± SD age = 33.37 ± 11.73 years, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale: 21.79 ± 6.59; diagnosed by ICD-10/DSM-IV-TR) were compared to 19 matched healthy controls (8 female, 11 male, mean ± SD age = 31.63 ± 10.79 years) and investigated (2012-2014) with the loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP) as a marker of the synaptic serotonergic activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the delay discounting paradigm, inducing OFC blood-oxygen level-dependent activity in the 2 groups. There were significant correlation coefficients between LDAEP (eLORETA right side) and fMRI OFC activities (anatomic region of interest) within the delay discounting paradigm (immediate vs control) in patients with OCD (r = -0.554; P = .014). LDAEP differed between the 2 groups with larger LDAEP at Cz in OCD patients indicating low serotonergic activity (0.28 ± 0.14 vs 0.20 ± 0.10 µV/10 dB, F₂,₃₅ = 4.66, P = .016). fMRI activations of dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex as well as ventral striatum (functional region of interest) were different between OCD and healthy volunteers. The 2 main pathophysiologic hypotheses of OCD seem to be related to each other as measured by LDAEP and fMRI OFC activity during the delay discounting task. This could be interpreted as a further hint that low serotonergic activity induces altered OFC responsivity, which has to be treated in each patient with OCD by a serotonin agonist.",2018
Brain serotonin synthesis capacity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: effects of cognitive behavioral therapy and sertraline.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are both effective treatments for some patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), yet little is known about the neurochemical changes related to these treatment modalities. Here, we used positron emission tomography and the α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-L-tryptophan tracer to examine the changes in brain regional serotonin synthesis capacity in OCD patients following treatment with CBT or SSRI treatment. Sixteen medication-free OCD patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either CBT or sertraline treatment. Pre-to-post treatment changes in the α-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-L-tryptophan brain trapping constant, K* (ml/g/min), were assessed as a function of symptom response, and correlations with symptom improvement were examined. Responders/partial responders to treatment did not show significant changes in relative regional tracer uptake; rather, in responders/partial responders, 12 weeks of treatment led to serotonin synthesis capacity increases that were brain-wide. Irrespective of treatment modality, baseline serotonin synthesis capacity in the raphe nuclei correlated positively with clinical improvement. These observations suggest that, for some patients, successful remediation of OCD symptoms might be associated with greater serotonergic tone.",2018
Improved serotonergic neurotransmission by genistein pretreatment regulates symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.,"Background Initial evidences have shown that diabetes mellitus occurs concomitantly with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptomatology. Serotonergic psychiatric therapy posits that serotonin is a central character in the management of OCD. Hence, it is worth investigating novel chemical entities affecting the serotonergic system for targeting OCD. An isoflavonoid phytoestrogen, genistein, has been recognized as of great pharmacological value especially for protecting neurodegeneration, depression (serotonin regulation), and diabetes. The effectiveness of genistein pretreatment on the symptoms of OCD in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice is investigated in this study. We also evaluate the probable involvement of the serotonergic system. Methods Groups of diabetic mice were treated with genistein at the dose of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg (intraperitoneal, twice daily, 14 days), and symptoms of OCD were assessed by the marble-burying behavior, in comparison with the standard drug fluoxetine. Neurochemical assessment of the serotonergic ratio 5-hydroxyindole-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HIAA/5-HT) in the cortical region of the brain was performed using HPLC (high-pressure liquid chromatography). Results Chronic treatment with genistein significantly recovered [F(6, 35)=53.00, p<0.0001, R2=0.9008] the symptoms of OCD as assessed by marble burying behavior in normal and diabetic mice. Locomotor performance was not influenced by the diabetic condition or any associated treatment. The turnover of serotonin neurotransmission (5-HIAA/5-HT) was significantly boosted in the diabetic condition; genistein treatment dragged it [F(6, 35)=35.75, p<0.0001, R2=0.8597] toward the respective control. Conclusions Genistein supplementation might be a potential therapeutic line for the management and/or prevention of diabetes-associated OCD symptomatology.",2018
"Cholinergic Functioning, Cognition, and Anticholinergic Medication Burden in Schizophrenia.","Acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is critical for central nervous function and is known to be abnormal in schizophrenia (SZ), a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder in which cognitive deficits persist, despite treatment. This review provides a summary of the clinical evidence linking ACh abnormalities to SZ-associated cognitive deficits, an overview of ACh-based pro-cognitive strategies attempted in SZ, and a survey of recent studies that describe the impact of anticholinergic medication burden on cognitive outcomes in SZ. Methodological challenges that currently limit more substantial investigation of ACh in SZ patients and future directions are also discussed.",2023
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors for psychotic disorders: bench-side to clinic.,"Modern interest in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activators for schizophrenia began in the 1990s when xanomeline, an M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>4</sub>-preferring mAChR agonist developed for cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), had unexpected antipsychotic activity. However, strategies to address tolerability concerns associated with activation of peripheral mAChRs were not available at that time. The discovery of specific targeted ligands and combination treatments to reduce peripheral mAChR engagement have advanced the potential of mAChR activators as effective treatments for psychotic disorders. This review provides perspectives on the background of the identification of mAChRs as potential antipsychotics, advances in the preclinical understanding of mAChRs as targets, and the current state of mAChR activators under active clinical development for schizophrenia.",2022
The Acetylcholine Therapy in the Treatment of Schizophrenia - The Experience of Mario Fiamberti in the Hospital of Varese (1937).,"In the first half of the 20th century, in most European countries, it was thought that cholinesterase and other drugs that counteract acetylcholine should reduce the manifestations of schizophrenia. In 1937, Fiamberti (1894-1970) introduced the transorbital method of lobotomy which established the use of acetylcholine shock treatment for curing the disturbances of schizophrenia. Accepting the idea that the psychic alterations of schizophrenia were caused by a pathological interruption of nerve conduction at a presumably cortical level, Fiamberti thought he could apply this to the clinical field using the properties of acetylcholine, an acetic ester of choline. Here, we examined, in detail, the contribution of Mario Fiamberti to acetylcholine therapy.",2019
Design and Synthesis of Novel Positive Allosteric Modulators of α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors with the Ability To Rescue Auditory Gating Deficit in Mice.,"A series of novel thiazolo[4,5- d]pyrimidin-7(6 H)-ones (3aa-3eq) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as the type I positive allosteric modulators of human α7 nAChR expressed in Xenopus ooctyes by a two-electrode voltage clamp. The structure-activity relationship analysis identified the compound 3ea as a potent and efficacious PAM with the maximum activation effect of the α7 current of over 1633% in the presence of acetylcholine (100 μM) and an EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.26 μM. It is highly specific to α7 nAChR over other subtypes of nAChR, 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>, NMDA, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Compound 3ea showed an elimination half-life of 10.8 ± 1.5 h for 3 mg/kg, i.v., and 7.4 ± 1.1 h for 60 mg/kg, i.g. in rat. It also exhibited sufficient blood-brain barrier penetration with no significant effect on hERG channel. Most importantly, compound 3ea dose-dependently (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the prepulse inhibition deficit induced by MK-801 in the mouse schizophrenia model.",2019
Unique Molecular Regulation of Higher-Order Prefrontal Cortical Circuits: Insights into the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is associated with core deficits in cognitive abilities and impaired functioning of the newly evolved prefrontal association cortex (PFC). In particular, neuropathological studies of schizophrenia have found selective atrophy of the pyramidal cell microcircuits in deep layer III of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and compensatory weakening of related GABAergic interneurons. Studies in monkeys have shown that recurrent excitation in these layer III microcircuits generates the precisely patterned, persistent firing needed for working memory and abstract thought. Importantly, excitatory synapses on layer III spines are uniquely regulated at the molecular level in ways that may render them particularly vulnerable to genetic and/or environmental insults. Glutamate actions are remarkably dependent on cholinergic stimulation, and there are inherent mechanisms to rapidly weaken connectivity, e.g. during stress. In particular, feedforward cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-calcium signaling rapidly weakens network connectivity and neuronal firing by opening nearby potassium channels. Many mechanisms that regulate this process are altered in schizophrenia and/or associated with genetic insults. Current data suggest that there are ""dual hits"" to layer III dlPFC circuits: initial insults to connectivity during the perinatal period due to genetic errors and/or inflammatory insults that predispose the cortex to atrophy, followed by a second wave of cortical loss during adolescence, e.g. driven by stress, at the descent into illness. The unique molecular regulation of layer III circuits may provide a nexus where inflammation disinhibits the neuronal response to stress. Understanding these mechanisms may help to illuminate dlPFC susceptibility in schizophrenia and provide insights for novel therapeutic targets.",2018
Stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine alpha7 receptors rescue schizophrenia-like cognitive impairments in rats.,"Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) dysfunction plays an important role in schizophrenia. Positive allosteric modulators of α7 nAChR have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to manage cognitive deficits that are inadequately treated in schizophrenic patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of type I (CCMI) and type II (PNU120596) α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulators to counteract MK-801-induced cognitive and sensorimotor gating deficits. The activity of these compounds was compared with the action of the α7 nAChR agonist A582941. CCMI, PNU120596 and A582941 reversed the sensorimotor gating impairment evoked by MK-801 based on the prepulse inhibition of the startle response. Additionally, no MK-801-evoked working memory deficits were observed with α7 nAChR ligand pretreatment as assessed in a discrete paired-trial delayed alternation task. However, these compounds did not affect the rats' attentional performances in the five-choice serial reaction time test. The α7 nAChR agents demonstrated a beneficial effect on sensorimotor gating and some aspects of cognition tested in a rat model of schizophrenia. Therefore, these results support the use of α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulators as a potential treatment strategy in schizophrenia.",2017
Crystal structures of the M1 and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.,"Muscarinic M1-M5 acetylcholine receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate many vital functions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In particular, the M1 and M4 receptor subtypes have emerged as attractive drug targets for treatments of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, but the high conservation of the acetylcholine-binding pocket has spurred current research into targeting allosteric sites on these receptors. Here we report the crystal structures of the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors bound to the inverse agonist, tiotropium. Comparison of these structures with each other, as well as with the previously reported M2 and M3 receptor structures, reveals differences in the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites that contribute to a role in drug selectivity at this important receptor family. We also report identification of a cluster of residues that form a network linking the orthosteric and allosteric sites of the M4 receptor, which provides new insight into how allosteric modulation may be transmitted between the two spatially distinct domains.",2016
4-Phenylpyridin-2-one Derivatives: A Novel Class of Positive Allosteric Modulator of the M1 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor.,"Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR) are a promising strategy for the treatment of the cognitive deficits associated with diseases including Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel family of M1 mAChR PAMs. The most active compounds of the 4-phenylpyridin-2-one series exhibited comparable binding affinity to the reference compound, 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (BQCA) (1), but markedly improved positive cooperativity with acetylcholine, and retained exquisite selectivity for the M1 mAChR. Furthermore, our pharmacological characterization revealed ligands with a diverse range of activities, including modulators that displayed both high intrinsic efficacy and PAM activity, those that showed no detectable agonism but robust PAM activity and ligands that displayed robust allosteric agonism but little modulatory activity. Thus, the 4-phenylpyridin-2-one scaffold offers an attractive starting point for further lead optimization.",2016
"The muscarinic system, cognition and schizophrenia.","An increasing body of evidence has implicated the central muscarinic system as contributing to a number of symptoms of schizophrenia and serving as a potential target for pharmaceutical interventions. A theoretical review is presented that focuses on the central muscarinic system's contribution to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The aim is to bridge the void between pertinent neuropsychological and neurobiological research to provide an explanatory account of the role that the central muscarinic system plays in the symptoms of schizophrenia. First, there will be a brief overview of the relevant neuropsychological schizophrenia literature, followed by a concise introduction to the central muscarinic system. Subsequently, we will draw from animal, neuropsychological and pharmacological literature, and discuss the findings in relation to cognition, schizophrenia and the muscarinic system. Whilst unifying the multiple domains of research into a concise review will act as a useful line of enquiry into the central muscarinic systems contribution to the symptoms of schizophrenia, it will be made apparent that more research is needed in this field.",2015
Neurobiological background of negative symptoms.,"Studies investigating neurobiological bases of negative symptoms of schizophrenia failed to provide consistent findings, possibly due to the heterogeneity of this psychopathological construct. We tried to review the findings published to date investigating neurobiological abnormalities after reducing the heterogeneity of the negative symptoms construct. The literature in electronic databases as well as citations and major articles are reviewed with respect to the phenomenology, pathology, genetics and neurobiology of schizophrenia. We searched PubMed with the keywords ""negative symptoms,"" ""deficit schizophrenia,"" ""persistent negative symptoms,"" ""neurotransmissions,"" ""neuroimaging"" and ""genetic."" Additional articles were identified by manually checking the reference lists of the relevant publications. Publications in English were considered, and unpublished studies, conference abstracts and poster presentations were not included. Structural and functional imaging studies addressed the issue of neurobiological background of negative symptoms from several perspectives (considering them as a unitary construct, focusing on primary and/or persistent negative symptoms and, more recently, clustering them into factors), but produced discrepant findings. The examined studies provided evidence suggesting that even primary and persistent negative symptoms include different psychopathological constructs, probably reflecting the dysfunction of different neurobiological substrates. Furthermore, they suggest that complex alterations in multiple neurotransmitter systems and genetic variants might influence the expression of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. On the whole, the reviewed findings, representing the distillation of a large body of disparate data, suggest that further deconstruction of negative symptomatology into more elementary components is needed to gain insight into underlying neurobiological mechanisms.",2015
The duplicated α7 subunits assemble and form functional nicotinic receptors with the full-length α7.,"The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA7) is linked to schizophrenia. A partial duplication of CHRNA7 (CHRFAM7A) is found in humans on 15q13-14. Exon 6 of CHRFAM7A harbors a 2-bp deletion polymorphism, CHRFAM7AΔ2bp, which is also associated with schizophrenia. To understand the effects of the duplicated subunits on α7 receptors, we fused α7, dupα7, and dupΔα7 subunits with various fluorescent proteins. The duplicated subunits co-localized with full-length α7 subunits in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a) as well as rat hippocampal neurons. We investigated the interaction between the duplicated subunits and full-length α7 by measuring Förster resonance energy transfer using donor recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The results revealed that the duplicated proteins co-assemble with α7. In electrophysiological studies, Leu at the 9'-position in the M2 membrane-spanning segment was replaced with Cys in dupα7 or dupΔα7, and constructs were co-transfected with full-length α7 in Neuro2a cells. Exposure to ethylammonium methanethiosulfonate inhibited acetylcholine-induced currents, showing that the assembled functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) included the duplicated subunit. Incorporation of dupα7 and dupΔα7 subunits modestly changes the sensitivity of receptors to choline and varenicline. Thus, the duplicated proteins are assembled and transported to the cell membrane together with full-length α7 subunits and alter the function of the nAChRs. The characterization of dupα7 and dupΔα7 as well as their influence on α7 nAChRs may help explain the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may suggest therapeutic strategies.",2014
Neuromodulation by acetylcholine: examples from schizophrenia and depression.,"The contribution of acetylcholine to psychiatric illnesses remains an area of active research. For example, increased understanding of mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of cortical function has provided insight into attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia. Acetylcholine normally enhances cortical sensitivity to external stimuli and decreases corticocortical communication, increasing focused attention; however, increases in ACh signaling can lead to symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For example, while stress-induced ACh release can result in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, chronic elevations in cholinergic signaling may produce maladaptive behaviors. Here, we review several innovations in human imaging, molecular genetics and physiological control of circuits that have begun to identify mechanisms linking altered cholinergic neuromodulation to schizophrenia and depression.",2014
The novel object recognition test in rodents in relation to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.,"Novel object recognition (NOR) in rodents is analogous in some ways to human declarative (episodic) memory, one of the seven cognitive domains which are abnormal in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (CIS) accounts for the largest proportion of the poor functional outcomes in this complex syndrome, with psychosis and negative symptoms accounting for much of the rest. Current atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) e.g. amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine and risperidone, and typical APDs as well, significantly improve some, but not all aspects of CIS, including declarative memory, but not in all patients, and rarely restore normal function. Thus, finding new ways to prevent or treat CIS is a major goal of current schizophrenia research, with animal models as an essential tool. NOR in rodents is valuable in this regard because of its relationship to declarative memory, the extensive knowledge of its underlying circuitry, and the ease and reliability of assessment. Sub-chronic administration of an N-methyl-Daspartate receptor (NMDAR) non-competitive antagonist, e.g. phencyclidine (PCP), dizocilpine (MK-801) or ketamine, is a favored means to study NOR as a model of CIS, because it produces deficient glutamatergic and GABAergic function, both of which have been implicated in the development of CIS. Transgenic mice and anti-cholinergic-induced deficits in NOR have received less attention. We review here NOR studies in rodents that bear upon CIS, including the evidence that atypical, but not typical APDs, as well as specific ligands, e.g. 5-HT1A partial agonists, 5-HT7 antagonists, D1 agonists, among others, can restore NOR following sub-chronic NMDAR antagonist treatment, and can also prevent the impairment in NOR produced by sub-chronic NMDAR antagonists. We discuss how well these findings translate to the bedside.",2014
Synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia alters basic brain processes of perception, emotion, and judgment to cause hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and cognitive deficits. Unlike neurodegeneration diseases that have irreversible neuronal degeneration and death, schizophrenia lacks agreeable pathological hallmarks, which makes it one of the least understood psychiatric disorders. With identification of schizophrenia susceptibility genes, recent studies have begun to shed light on underlying pathological mechanisms. Schizophrenia is believed to result from problems during neural development that lead to improper function of synaptic transmission and plasticity, and in agreement, many of the susceptibility genes encode proteins critical for neural development. Some, however, are also expressed at high levels in adult brain. Here, we will review evidence for altered neurotransmission at glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic synapses in schizophrenia and discuss roles of susceptibility genes in neural development as well as in synaptic plasticity and how their malfunction may contribute to pathogenic mechanisms of schizophrenia. We propose that mouse models with precise temporal and spatial control of mutation or overexpression would be useful to delineate schizophrenia pathogenic mechanisms.",2012
Muscarinic agonists and antagonists in schizophrenia: recent therapeutic advances and future directions.,"Existing therapies for schizophrenia have limited efficacy, and significant residual positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms remain in many individuals with the disorder even after treatment with the current arsenal of antipsychotic drugs. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that selective activation of the muscarinic cholinergic system may represent novel therapeutic mechanisms for the treatment of schizophrenia. The therapeutic relevance of earlier muscarinic agonists was limited by their lack of receptor selectivity and adverse event profile arising from activation of nontarget muscarinic receptors. Recent advances in developing compounds that are selective to muscarinic receptor subtypes or activate allosteric receptor sites offer tremendous promise for therapeutic targeting of specific muscarinic receptor subtypes in schizophrenia.",2012

[Genome-wide association analyses for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia].,"Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements that develop in patients treated with long-term dopaminergic antagonists, usually antipsychotics. By a genome-wide association screening of TD in 50 Japanese schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant TD and 50 Japanese schizophrenia patients without TD (non-TD group) and subsequent confirmation in independent samples of 36 treatment-resistant TD and 136 non-TD subjects, we identified an association of SNPs in the HSPG2 (heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, perlecan) gene with TD. By canonical pathway-based analyses with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, we also found that genes involved in the GABA receptor signaling pathway were significantly enriched among the genes with gene-based corrected association allelic P values of less than 0.05. The gene expression levels in the postmortem prefrontal brains in those with the risk genotypes for TD were in the opposite direction to those in mouse brains after long-term admiration of haloperidol. These findings indicate that individuals with the susceptibility to TD may have less ability to adapt to long-term exposure of neuroleptics in some gene expression levels.",2011
Transient inactivation of the neonatal ventral hippocampus permanently disrupts the mesolimbic regulation of prefrontal cholinergic transmission: implications for schizophrenia.,"These experiments determined the mesolimbic modulation of cortical cholinergic transmission in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Mesolimbic-cholinergic abnormalities are hypothesized to contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. Stimulation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAC) increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a mechanism recently demonstrated to contribute to the control of attentional performance. We determined the ability of intra-NAC administration of NMDA to increase prefrontal ACh levels in adult rats that had received bilateral infusions of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to transiently interrupt impulse flow in the ventral hippocampus (VH) during development. Rats received infusions of TTX or saline on postnatal day 7 (PD7) or day 32 (PD32), and the effects of NAC NMDA receptor stimulation on prefrontal cholinergic neurotransmission were assessed in adulthood. In animals treated as controls on PD7, NMDA increased prefrontal ACh levels by 121% above baseline. In contrast, PD7 infusions of TTX into the VH abolished the ability of NAC NMDA to activate prefrontal cholinergic neurotransmission (7% increase). In animals that received TTX infusions on PD32, NMDA-evoked cholinergic activity did not differ from controls, indicating a restricted, neonatal critical period during which VH TTX impacts the organization of mesolimbic-basal forebrain-cortical circuitry. Importantly, the failure of NAC NMDA to evoke cholinergic activity in rats treated with TTX on PD7 did not reflect a reduced excitability of corticopetal cholinergic neurons because administration of amphetamine produced similar elevations of prefrontal ACh levels in PD7 TTX and PD7 control animals. A third series of experiments demonstrated that the effects of PD7 TTX are a specific consequence of transient disruption of impulse flow in the VH. Intra-NAC NMDA evoked prefrontal ACh release in rats receiving TTX, on PD7, into the dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala, or NAC. Thus, impulse flow specifically within the VH, during a sensitive period of development, is necessary for the functional organization of a mesolimbic-cortical circuit known to mediate attentional control processes. Therefore, neonatal inactivation of VH represents an effective animal model for studying the basis of certain cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",2011
Treating schizophrenia: novel targets for the cholinergic system.,"Cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia are the biggest obstacle to achieving an independent and productive lifestyle, with these deficits being refractory to current drug treatments. Significantly, both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (cholinoceptors) have been shown to have an important role in cognition and are therefore viewed as potential therapeutic targets for drugs designed to lessen cognitive deficits. Importantly, the demonstration that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which result in higher synaptic levels of acetylcholine, can reduce the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia suggested that under-stimulation of cholinoceptors could be associated with the cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. This has lead to a focus on the development of receptor agonists, partial agonists and allosteric agonists that can be used to stimulate cholinergic pathways and thus reduce the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. In addition, muscarinic receptors have now been associated with the modulation of dopamine and may constitute an alternative target for the treatment of psychoses. Given these exciting new therapeutic initiatives, this review will outline current evidence that involves the cholinoceptors in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and how these data can inform on approaches to more targeted treatments for the disorder.",2010
Muscarinic receptors in psychiatric disorders - can we mimic 'health'?,"The concept that acetylcholine is involved in the pathophysiologies of psychiatric disorders has existed since the 1950s. There is very strong evidence implicating a dysfunctional muscarinic system in schizophrenia, +with less information available for bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. The translation of this evidence into clinically viable treatments has been disappointing; hampered by problems associated with developing drugs that target the requisite members of the muscarinic family, rather than all of the receptors, which results in unacceptable side-effect profiles. The discovery of additional binding sites, other than the one occupied by acetylcholine, has revitalised research into this aspect of psychopharmacology. New compounds are now being developed that have the potential to selectively target individual muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system. The question that remains to be answered is whether stimulating central muscarinic receptors will result in the reestablishment of normal central muscarinic activity? The purpose of this review is to (i) summarise the data supporting a role of the muscarinic system in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, and (ii) give an overview of some of the new selective muscarinic ligands that are currently in development and try to address the issue of re-establishing appropriate central muscarinic function.",2009
Disruption of mesolimbic regulation of prefrontal cholinergic transmission in an animal model of schizophrenia and normalization by chronic clozapine treatment.,"Abnormal mesolimbic control of cortical cholinergic activity has been hypothesized to contribute to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Stimulation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAC) increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in prefrontal cortex (PFC), an activation thought to contribute to attentional processing. Thus, the effects of intra-NAC perfusion of NMDA (250-400 microM) on ACh release in PFC were determined in rats receiving lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) as neonates (nVHLX), a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, or as adults (aVHLX). NMDA elevated ACh release (100-150% above baseline) in adults sham-lesioned as neonates or in aVHLX rats. Adult nVHLX were unresponsive to NAC NMDA receptor stimulation. The inability of nVHLX to respond to NMDA emerged over development as a separate experiment demonstrated that evoked ACh release was normal before puberty (100-150% increase) yet, in these same nVHLX animals, absent after puberty. Amphetamine-evoked ACh release was assessed in nVHLX animals to exclude potential limitations in release capacity. Amphetamine produced greater increases in ACh release than in shams, indicating that nVHLX does not impair the capacity of cholinergic neurons to release ACh. Finally, the ability of 13 days of pretreatment with clozapine (1.25 mg/kg/day) to reinstate NMDA-evoked cortical ACh efflux was determined. Clozapine treatment normalized NMDA-evoked ACh release in nVHLX animals. These experiments show that mesolimbic regulation of cortical ACh release is disrupted in postpubertal nVHLX rats and normalized by low-dose treatment of clozapine; supporting the usefulness of nVHLX animals for research on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",2009
Using the pharmacology of latent inhibition to model domains of pathology in schizophrenia and their treatment.,"Latent inhibition (LI) is a cross species selective attention phenomenon reflecting a modulating effect of past experience with inconsequential stimuli on current task performance involving these stimuli. Specifically, it refers to the observation that organisms that receive nonreinforced preexposure to the to-be conditioned stimulus are less efficient in generating a conditioned response to that stimulus when it is subsequently paired with reinforcement. Because dysfunction of attentional selectivity is a fundamental deficit associated with schizophrenia, disrupted LI is long considered to model attentional abnormalities in schizophrenia. Here we show that different pharmacological manipulations can produce two poles of abnormality in LI: disrupted LI under conditions which yield LI in non-treated rats, and abnormally persistent LI under conditions which disrupt LI in non-treated rats. We describe several distinct LI models based upon the manipulation used to alter the expression of LI, the direction of LI abnormality, and responsiveness to typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) as well as other schizophrenia-relevant treatments: DA agonist; DA antagonist; NMDA antagonist; and muscarinic antagonist. We tentatively suggest that these models represent four domains of pathology in schizophrenia: DA agonist and muscarinic antagonist-induced disrupted LI represents a domain of positive symptoms that respond to typical and atypical APDs and some cognitive enhancers; NMDA antagonist-induced persistent LI represents a domain of negative/cognitive symptoms that respond to atypical APDs and cognitive enhancers but not typical APDs; antimuscarinic-induced persistent LI represents a domain of cognitive symptoms that are responsive to cognitive enhancers but are resistant to typical and atypical APDs; finally, DA antagonist-induced persistent LI represents a domain of negative symptoms that are treatable by atypical APDs but are resistant to cognitive enhancers.",2009
Modeling cholinergic aspects of schizophrenia: focus on the antimuscarinic syndrome.,"Symptoms of schizophrenia, commonly divided into positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments, exhibit different sensitivity to pharmacological treatments. As such, they are typically modeled in animals by behavioral effects of drugs that evoke these symptoms in humans, such as amphetamine or phencyclidine (PCP). Despite the fact that muscarinic antagonists also evoke a schizophrenia-like syndrome (""antimuscarinic syndrome"") and findings of cholinergic-related alterations in brains of schizophrenia patients, modeling schizophrenia using muscarinic manipulations has been infrequently considered, and the effects of muscarinic blockade on behavioral tasks relevant to schizophrenia have not been adequately characterized. The present review surveys recent attempts to model schizophrenia-related symptoms using manipulations causing cholinergic dysfunction, particularly muscarinic blockade, in well validated behavioral models of schizophrenia, such as prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition.",2009
Astrocyte-derived kynurenic acid modulates basal and evoked cortical acetylcholine release.,"We tested the hypothesis that fluctuations in the levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, modulate extracellular ACh levels in the medial prefrontal cortex in rats. Decreases in cortical KYNA levels were achieved by local perfusion of S-ESBA, a selective inhibitor of the astrocytic enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), which catalyses the formation of KYNA from its precursor L-kynurenine. At 5 mm, S-ESBA caused a 30% reduction in extracellular KYNA levels, which was accompanied by a two-threefold increase in basal cortical ACh levels. Co-perfusion of KYNA in the endogenous range (100 nm), which by itself tended to reduce basal ACh levels, blocked the ability of S-ESBA to raise extracellular ACh levels. KYNA perfusion (100 nm) also prevented the evoked ACh release caused by d-amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg). This effect was duplicated by the systemic administration of kynurenine (50 mg/kg), which resulted in a significant increase in cortical KYNA formation. Jointly, these data indicate that astrocytes, by producing and releasing KYNA, have the ability to modulate cortical cholinergic neurotransmission under both basal and stimulated conditions. As cortical KYNA levels are elevated in individuals with schizophrenia, and in light of the established role of cortical ACh in executive functions, our findings suggest that drugs capable of attenuating the production of KYNA may be of benefit in the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",2009
Dysconnection in schizophrenia: from abnormal synaptic plasticity to failures of self-monitoring.,"Over the last 2 decades, a large number of neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have furnished in vivo evidence for dysconnectivity, ie, abnormal functional integration of brain processes. While the evidence for dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is strong, its etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and significance for clinical symptoms are unclear. First, dysconnectivity could result from aberrant wiring of connections during development, from aberrant synaptic plasticity, or from both. Second, it is not clear how schizophrenic symptoms can be understood mechanistically as a consequence of dysconnectivity. Third, if dysconnectivity is the primary pathophysiology, and not just an epiphenomenon, then it should provide a mechanistic explanation for known empirical facts about schizophrenia. This article addresses these 3 issues in the framework of the dysconnection hypothesis. This theory postulates that the core pathology in schizophrenia resides in aberrant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic plasticity due to abnormal regulation of NMDARs by neuromodulatory transmitters like dopamine, serotonin, or acetylcholine. We argue that this neurobiological mechanism can explain failures of self-monitoring, leading to a mechanistic explanation for first-rank symptoms as pathognomonic features of schizophrenia, and may provide a basis for future diagnostic classifications with physiologically defined patient subgroups. Finally, we test the explanatory power of our theory against a list of empirical facts about schizophrenia.",2009
Glutamate-Based Therapeutic Strategies for Schizophrenia: Emerging Approaches Beyond Dopamine.,"Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder composed of primary cluster-positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganization, neurocognitive deficits, and social cognitive impairments. While traditional antipsychotics primarily target dopamine pathways, they provide limited efficacy against cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Growing evidence implicates glutamatergic dysregulation, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) hypofunction, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, making glutamate modulation a promising therapeutic approach. This review explores emerging glutamate-based treatment strategies, including NMDA receptor modulators, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agents, glutamate transporter regulators, and kynurenine pathway inhibitors. We summarize preclinical and clinical findings on NMDA co-agonists (D-serine and glycine), glycine transporter inhibitors, D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors, and mGluR-targeted therapies, highlighting their mechanisms, efficacy, and limitations. In addition, we discuss novel interventions aimed at restoring glutamate homeostasis, including neuroinflammatory modulation and synaptic plasticity enhancers. Despite promising results, many glutamate-targeting therapies have yielded inconsistent clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and optimized treatment protocols. We propose that integrating glutamate modulators with existing antipsychotic regimens may enhance therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Future research should focus on refining glutamate-based interventions, identifying predictive biomarkers, and addressing the heterogeneity in schizophrenia pathology. With continued advancements, glutamate modulation has the potential to transform schizophrenia treatment, particularly for cognitive and negative symptoms that remain largely unaddressed by current therapies.",2025
[Research progress of the dopamine system in neurological diseases].,"The etiology of nervous system diseases is complicated, posing significant harm to patients and often resulting in poor prognoses. In recent years, the role of dopaminergic system in nervous system diseases has attracted much attention, and its complex regulatory mechanism and therapeutic potential have been gradually revealed. This paper reviews the role of dopaminergic neurons, the neurotransmitter dopamine, dopamine receptors and dopamine transporters in neurological diseases (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia), with a view to further elucidating the disease mechanism and providing new insights and strategies for the treatment of neurological diseases.",2025
Hippocampal perineuronal net degradation identifies prefrontal and striatal circuits involved in schizophrenia-like changes in marmosets.,"In schizophrenia, anterior hippocampus (aHipp) overactivity is associated with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) dysfunction, but the contribution to symptomatology is unknown. In rodents, degradation of the hippocampal perineuronal net (PNN) replicates this overactivity, but uncertainty over rodent/human prefrontal homology limits translation to humans. Here, we test the hypothesis that aHipp PNN degradation in a species with a human-like prefrontal cortex, the marmoset, alters aHipp-striatal and aHipp-OFC circuitry. Microdialysis and [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography identified increased dopamine synthesis in the associative striatum, but not the nucleus accumbens, as is seen in schizophrenia, and elevated dopamine and noradrenaline in the OFC. Behaviorally, activity was elevated in a marmoset version of the amphetamine-induced activity test, and impaired probabilistic discrimination learning was seen in an OFC/striatum-dependent task that computational modeling suggests was due to loss of goal-directed behavior. Together, these findings demonstrate that a loss of primate aHipp PNNs is sufficient to induce striatal and prefrontal dysfunction consistent with that observed in humans with schizophrenia.",2025
Disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolites in peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine: a preliminary targeted metabolomic study.,"The aim of this research was to characterize changes in peripheral blood neurotransmitter metabolites in olanzapine-treated schizophrenia (SCZ) and to identify potential biomarkers for SCZ. Concurrently, the relationship between these differential neurotransmitters and cognitive function is explored. We recruited 40 SCZ treated with single-agent olanzapine and 40 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive function and psychopathology were assessed using the MCCB and PANSS, respectively. Neurotransmitter levels were determined by targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). SCZ showed cognitive impairment in all domains of the MCCB compared to HC. Interestingly, a 4-neurotransmitter panel consisting of 3-Methoxytyramine hydrochloride (3-MT), 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetate (DOPAC), arginine, and r-aminobutyric acid (GABA) illustrated the highest determinative score between SCZ and HC. Arginine was positively correlated with PANSS general psychopathology scores. 3-MT independently predicted the verbal learning scores only in SCZ, whereas GABA independently predicted the social cognition scores only. Furthermore, GABA independently predicted the working memory scores only in HC. The collective assessment of these four neurotransmitters (3-MT, DOPAC, arginine, and GABA) holds considerable promise as potential biomarkers for SCZ. Moreover, 3-MT and GABA may enhance our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ, particularly in areas of verbal learning and social cognitive dysfunction.",2025
Impact of neuroinflammation on brain glutamate and dopamine signalling in schizophrenia: an update.,"Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Over the years, numerous treatment options have been introduced for schizophrenia. Although they are relatively successful in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, most of the current treatments have a negligible effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms. Thus, none of them could prevent the relapse of psychotic episodes. Among the numerous hypotheses explaining the development and progression of schizophrenia, the cytokine hypothesis explains the role of inflammatory markers as a significant culprit in the development of schizophrenia. Elevated cytokines are reported in animal models and schizophrenic patients. The cytokine hypothesis is based on how increased inflammatory markers can cause changes in the dopaminergic, glutamate, and tryptophan metabolism pathways, like that observed in schizophrenic patients. Reasons, such as autoimmune disease, maternal immune activation, infection, etc., can pave the way for the development of schizophrenia and are associated with the negative, positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is a need to focus on the significance of anti-inflammatory drugs against these symptoms. The development of new treatment strategies in the management of schizophrenia can provide better therapeutic outcomes in terms of the severity of symptoms and treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia. This review attempts to explain the association between elevated inflammatory markers and various neurotransmitters, and the possible use of medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, statins, and estrogens as adjuvant therapy. Over the years, these hypotheses have been the basis for drug discovery for the treatment of schizophrenia.",2025
Genetic risk for treatment resistant schizophrenia and corresponding variation in dopamine synthesis capacity and D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability in healthy individuals.,"Dysfunction of dopamine systems has long been considered a hallmark of schizophrenia, and nearly all current first-line medication treatments block dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors. However, approximately a quarter of patients will not adequately respond to these agents and are considered treatment-resistant. Whereas abnormally high striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity has been observed in people with schizophrenia, studies of treatment-resistant patients have not shown this pattern and have even found the opposite - i.e., reductions in striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity. Whether such reductions in fact represent clinical epiphenomena such as medication or other treatment effects or whether they rather represent neurobiological differences related to etiology has been unclear. To understand the dopaminergic implications of genetic liability for treatment-resistant schizophrenia without the confound of clinical epiphenomena, we studied a cohort of healthy individuals without neuropsychiatric illness using [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET) and found that striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity showed an expected direct association with cumulative genetic risk burden for general schizophrenia but an inverse association with specific polygenic risk for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Subsequent evaluation of D<sub>2/3</sub> dopamine receptor availability in an overlapping cohort using [<sup>18</sup>F]-fallypride PET did not identify any effects of genetic risk in the striatum but found an association with treatment-resistant schizophrenia polygenic risk in the thalamus. Overall, these results align with prior PET studies in patients and implicate, at least with respect to the dopamine system, fundamentally distinct molecular mechanisms in the unique genetic liability for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",2025
Dysbindin-1 Mutation Alters Prefrontal Cortex Extracellular Glutamate and Dopamine In Vivo.,"Elevated risk for schizophrenia is associated with a variation in the <i>DTNBP1</i> gene encoding dysbindin-1, which may underpin cognitive impairments in this prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve anomalies in glutamate and dopamine signaling, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Indeed, mice with <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations exhibit spatial and working memory deficits that are associated with deficits in glutamate release and NMDA receptor function as determined by slice electrophysiology. The present study extended the results from ex vivo approaches by examining how the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation impacts high K+- and NMDA receptor-evoked glutamate release within the PFC using in vivo microdialysis procedures. <i>Dntbp1</i> mutant mice are also reported to exhibit blunted K+-evoked dopamine release within the PFC. Thus, we examined also K+- and NMDA-evoked dopamine release within this region. Perfusion of high-concentration K+ or NMDA solutions increased the PFC levels of both dopamine and glutamate in wild-type (WT) but not in <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutants (MUT), whereas mice heterozygous for the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation (HET) exhibited blunted K+-evoked dopamine release. No net-flux microdialysis procedures confirmed elevated basal extracellular content of both glutamate and dopamine within the PFC of HET and MUT mice. These in vivo microdialysis results corroborate prior indications that <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations perturb evoked dopamine and glutamate release within the PFC, provide in vivo evidence for impaired NMDA receptor function within the PFC, and suggest that these neurochemical anomalies may be related to abnormally elevated basal neurotransmitter content.",2024
Synaptotagmin-11 deficiency mediates schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice via dopamine over-transmission.,"Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease, but the initiation mechanisms are unclear. Although antipsychotics are effective against positive symptoms, therapeutic interventions for negative symptoms are limited due to the lack of pathophysiological mechanisms. Here we identify synaptotagmin-11 (Syt11) as a potential genetic risk factor and dopamine over-transmission as a mechanism in the development of schizophrenia. Syt11 expression is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia but restored following the treatment with antipsychotics. Syt11 deficiency in dopamine neurons in early adolescence, but not in adults, leads to persistent social deficits and other schizophrenia-like behaviors by mediating dopamine over-transmission in mice. Accordingly, dopamine neuron over-excitation before late adolescence induces persistent schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits, along with the structural and functional alternations in the mPFC. Notably, local intervention of D2R with clinical drugs presynaptically or postsynaptically exhibits both acute and long-lasting therapeutic effects on social deficits in schizophrenia mice models. These findings not only define Syt11 as a risk factor and DA over-transmission as a potential risk factor initiating schizophrenia, but also propose two D2R-targeting strategies for the comprehensive and long-term recovery of schizophrenia-associated social withdrawal.",2024
THPP-1 PDE10A inhibitor reverses the cognitive deficits and hyperdopaminergic state in a neurodevelopment model of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. The neurodevelopmental methylazoxy-methanol acetate (MAM) rodent model replicates key neurobiological features of SCZ which includes hyperdopaminergic states in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and cognitive deficits. Typical and atypical antipsychotics are primarily effective in treating the positive symptoms of SCZ but often fall short of addressing cognitive deficits. A promising therapeutic approach for treating all symptoms of SCZ has emerged through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 10 A (PDE10A). Our study aim was to investigate the impact of acute and chronic THPP-1 (PDE10A inhibitor) treatment, in MAM rats, focusing on cognitive deficits and VTA dopamine (DA) activity. Adult offspring of pregnant rats treated with Saline or MAM (20 mg/kg) on gestational day 17 were treated with THPP-1 acutely (male/female rats; 3 mg/kg) at postnatal day (PD) 70-80 or chronically (males; 3 weeks; 2-3 mg/kg) from PD 70-91 and tested in the novel object recognition test and electrophysiological recording of DA neurons in the VTA. Acute THPP-1 treatment reversed cognitive impairments and normalized the increased number of active DA neurons in the VTA of male and female MAM rats, without affecting control rats. Also, chronic THPP-1 treatment reversed cognitive deficits and normalized DA hyperactivity in the VTA of male MAM rats. The efficacy of THPP-1 in reversing MAM-induced impairments underscores its ability to target disease-specific circuitry without affecting normal regulated systems in control rats. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of THPP-1 for addressing cognitive deficits and DA dysregulation in SCZ.",2024
Glia dysfunction in schizophrenia: evidence of possible therapeutic effects of nervonic acid in a preclinical model.,"Neuroinflammation may inhibit oligodendrocyte and astrocyte differentiation, which causes demyelination and synaptic degeneration. The myelin component nervonic acid (NA) may improve demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases. This study firstly explored relationships between glial cell dysfunction and demyelination or synaptic degeneration in schizophrenia patients, and secondly determined nervonic acid therapeutic effects in a preclinical schizophrenia model of mice. Plasma samples were collected from 18 male healthy controls and 18 male schizophrenic patients (diagnosed by DSM-V) at aged 18-55. Mouse brain samples were collected from a maternal immune activation (MIA) model of schizophrenia via injecting 5 mg/kg polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Male mouse offspring (age 2.5 months, n = 12) were treated by clozapine (15 mg/kg/day) or fed 0.5% NA for 6 weeks. Cytokine and dopamine (DA) concentrations, and glial phenotypes and myelin markers were measured in both human plasma and mouse brain samples. In patient plasma, increased proinflammatory cytokines were associated with reactive microglia (Iba-1) up-regulation, while decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines were related to microglia (CD206) downregulation. Decreased astrocyte marker (p11) concentrations were accompanied by reduced concentrations of oligodendrocyte and synaptic markers. However, NA and DA contents were increased. Compared with control mice, SZ-like behaviors appeared in MIA male mice. Changes in microglia and astrocytes markers, and cytokine concentrations in the frontal cortex were consistent with those observed in patients' plasma. Hippocampal oligodendrocyte and synaptic marker expression were also decreased. DA content and DA/metabolite (DAPOC) were increased in MIA mouse brains. Most of these changes were normalized by both clozapine and NA. Even though some NA effects were more pronounced than clozapine, only clozapine restored cytokine function. The data suggest a possible therapeutic route for schizophrenia patients.",2024
The relationship between alcohol bingeing in the gestational period of wistar rats and the development of schizophrenia in the offspring adult life.,"The incidence of schizophrenia in young adulthood may be associated with intrauterine factors, such as gestational alcohol consumption. This study investigated the relationship between a single high dose of alcohol during pregnancy in Wistar rats and the development of schizophrenia in the adult life of the offspring. On the 11th day of gestation, pregnant rats received either water or alcohol via intragastric gavage. Male and female offspring were subjected to behavioral tests at 30 days of age according to the maternal group. At 60 days of age, offspring received intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (ket) or saline (SAL). After the final ketamine administration, the adult offspring underwent behavioral tests, and their brain structures were removed for biochemical analysis. Alcohol binge drinking during pregnancy induces hyperlocomotion in both young female and male offspring, with males of alcohol-exposed mothers showing reduced social interactions. In adult offspring, ketamine induced hyperlocomotion; however, only females in the alcohol + ket group exhibited increased locomotor activity, and a decrease in the time to first contact was observed in the alcohol group. Cognitive impairment was exclusively observed in male animals in the alcohol group. Increased serotonin and dopamine levels were observed in male rats in the alcohol + ket group. Biochemical alterations indicate the effects of intrauterine alcohol exposure associated with ketamine in adult animals. These behavioral and biochemical changes suggest that the impact of prenatal stressors such as alcohol persists throughout the animals' lives and may be exacerbated by a second stressor in adulthood, such as ketamine.",2024
[Precision psychiatry and neuroimaging: Towards improved treatment success in psychosis].,"In the future, clinicians might use information about neurobiological processes, obtained through imaging techniques, to guide personalized prevention and intervention strategies for psychosis and related disorders. However, this requires more knowledge about these individuals&rsquo; brain function. To advance the current knowledge on neurobiological processes in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and individuals at increased risk of these disorders. We conducted a systematic review to address dopaminergic alterations in individuals at increased risk of SSD. Additionally, we acquired PET and MRI scans in patients with SSD and controls to obtain information about neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity was altered in individuals at increased risk of developing SSD compared to controls. In healthy volunteers, the concentration of neuromelanin, a breakdown product of dopamine, in the substantia nigra was negatively associated with striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. This was not the case for patients with SSD. We report differences in neurobiological processes and their interrelationships between patients with psychotic and related disorders and controls. This information may help predict psychosis susceptibility and treatment effectiveness in the future. Our findings can therefore contribute to the development of personalized treatments and better counselling of the patient.",2024
Amphetamine-Induced Dopamine Release Predicts 1-Year Outcome in First-Episode Psychosis: A Naturalistic Observation.,"The dopamine theory of schizophrenia suggests that antipsychotics alleviate symptoms by blocking dopamine D2/3 receptors, yet a significant subset of patients does not respond adequately to treatment. To investigate potential predictors, we evaluated d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release and 1-year clinical outcomes in 21 antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Twenty-one antipsychotic-naive patients (6 female) underwent dopamine D2/3 receptor radioligand [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography. For estimating dopamine release, scans were performed with and without d-amphetamine pretreatment. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was performed at regular intervals over 1 year while receiving treatment in a naturalistic setting (Clinical Trial Registry: EUDRACT 2010-019586-29). A group analysis revealed no significant differences in d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release between patients with or without clinically significant improvement. However, d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release in ventral striatum was significantly associated with reductions in positive symptoms (r = 0.54, P = .04; uncorrected P-values); release in globus pallidus correlated with a decrease in PANSS negative (r = 0.58, P = .02), general (r = 0.53, P = .04), and total symptom scores (r = 0.063, P = .01). Higher dopamine release in substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area predicted larger reductions in general symptoms (r = 0.51, P = .05). Post-amphetamine binding in putamen correlated positively with negative symptom scores at baseline (r = 0.66, P = .005) and throughout all follow-up visits. These exploratory results support a relationship between d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release and the severity and persistence of symptoms during the first year of psychosis.",2024
"The impact of subclinical psychotic symptoms on delay and effort discounting: Insights from behavioral, computational, and electrophysiological methods.","The ability to value rewards is crucial for adaptive behavior and is influenced by the time and effort required to obtain them. Impairments in these computations have been observed in patients with schizophrenia and may be present in individuals with subclinical psychotic symptoms (PS). In this study, we employed delay and effort-discounting tasks with food rewards in thirty-nine participants divided into high and low levels of PS. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of effort-discounting through computational modelling of dopamine prefrontal and subcortical circuits and the electrophysiological biomarker of both delay and effort-discounting alterations through resting-state frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). Results revealed greater delay discounting in the High PS group compared to the Low PS group but no differences in the effort discounting task. However, in this task, the same levels of estimated dopamine release were associated with a lower willingness to exert effort for high-calorie food rewards in High PS participants compared to Low PS participants. Although there were no significant differences in FAA between the High PS and Low PS groups, FAA was significantly associated with the severity of participants' negative symptoms. Our study suggests that the dysfunction in temporal and effort cost computations, seen in patients with schizophrenia, may be present in individuals with subclinical PS. These findings provide valuable insight into the early vulnerability markers (behavioral, computational, and electrophysiological) for psychosis, which may aid in the development of preventive interventions. These findings are preliminary and warrant further investigation.",2024
MicroRNA dysregulation in glutamate and dopamine pathways of schizophrenia: From molecular pathways to diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.,"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder, and genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in its development. Dysregulated glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission pathways are involved in schizophrenia development. Besides genetic mutations, epigenetic dysregulation has a considerable role in dysregulating molecular pathways involved in schizophrenia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that target specific mRNAs and inhibit their translation into proteins. As epigenetic factors, miRNAs regulate many genes involved in glutamate and dopamine signaling pathways; thereby, their dysregulation can contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Secretion of specific miRNAs from damaged cells into body fluids can make them one of the ideal non-invasive biomarkers in the early diagnosis of schizophrenia. Also, understanding the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in schizophrenia pathogenesis can pave the way for developing novel treatments for patients with schizophrenia. In this study, we reviewed the glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathophysiology and highlighted the role of miRNA dysregulation in schizophrenia development. Besides, we shed light on the significance of circulating miRNAs for schizophrenia diagnosis and the recent findings on the miRNA-based treatment for schizophrenia.",2024
NMDAR dysfunction and the regulation of dopaminergic transmission in schizophrenia.,"A substantial body of evidence implicates dysfunction in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This article illustrates how NMDAR dysfunction may give rise to many of the neurobiological phenomena frequently associated with schizophrenia with a particular focus on how NMDAR dysfunction affects the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg). Furthermore, this article presents a model for schizophrenia illustrating how dysfunction in the nRT may interrupt prefrontal regulation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and how dysfunction in the PPTg may drive increased, irregular burst firing.",2024
Mesostriatal Dopaminergic Circuit Dysfunction in Schizophrenia: A Multimodal Neuromelanin-Sensitive Magnetic Resonance Imaging and [<sup>18</sup>F]-DOPA Positron Emission Tomography Study.,"Striatal hyperdopaminergia is implicated in the pathoetiology of schizophrenia, but how this relates to dopaminergic midbrain activity is unclear. Neuromelanin (NM)-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging provides a marker of long-term dopamine function. We examined whether midbrain NM-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging contrast-to-noise ratio (NM-CNR) was higher in people with schizophrenia than in healthy control (HC) participants and whether this correlated with dopamine synthesis capacity. One hundred fifty-four participants (schizophrenia group: n = 74, HC group: n = 80) underwent NM-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA). A subset of the schizophrenia group (n = 38) also received [<sup>18</sup>F]-DOPA positron emission tomography to measure dopamine synthesis capacity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup>) in the SN-VTA and striatum. SN-VTA NM-CNR was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in HC participants (effect size = 0.38, p = .019). This effect was greatest for voxels in the medial and ventral SN-VTA. In patients, SN-VTA K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup> positively correlated with SN-VTA NM-CNR (r = 0.44, p = .005) and striatal K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup> (r = 0.71, p < .001). Voxelwise analysis demonstrated that SN-VTA NM-CNR was positively associated with striatal K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup> (r = 0.53, p = .005) and that this relationship seemed strongest between the ventral SN-VTA and associative striatum in schizophrenia. Our results suggest that NM levels are higher in patients with schizophrenia than in HC individuals, particularly in midbrain regions that project to parts of the striatum that receive innervation from the limbic and association cortices. The direct relationship between measures of NM and dopamine synthesis suggests that these aspects of schizophrenia pathophysiology are linked. Our findings highlight specific mesostriatal circuits as the loci of dopamine dysfunction in schizophrenia and thus as potential therapeutic targets.",2024
The role of midbrain dopamine cells projecting to the insular cortex in mediated performance: Implications for animal models of reality testing.,"A growing body of literature indicates that mediated learning techniques have specific utility for tapping into reality testing in animal models of neuropsychiatric illness. In particular, recent work has shown that animal models that recapitulate various endophenotypes of schizophrenia are particularly vulnerable to impairments in reality testing when undergoing mediated learning. Multiple studies have indicated that these effects are dopamine receptor 2-dependent and correlated with aberrant insular cortex (IC) activity. However, until now, the connection between dopamine and the IC had not been investigated. Here, we utilized a novel intersectional approach to label mesencephalic dopamine cells that specifically project to the insular cortex in both wild-type controls and transgenic mice expressing the dominant-negative form of the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC-1) gene. Using these techniques, we identified a population of cells that project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the IC. Afterward, we conducted multiple studies to test the necessity of this circuit in behaviors ranging from gustatory detection to the maintenance of effort and, finally, mediated performance. Our results indicate that perturbations of the DISC-1 genetic locus lead to a reduction in the number of cells in the VTA → IC circuit. Behaviorally, VTA → IC circuitry does not influence gustatory detection or motivation to acquire sucrose reward; however, inactivation of this circuit differentially suppresses Pavlovian approach behavior in wild-type and DISC-1 transgenic mice during mediated performance testing. Moreover, under these testing conditions, inactivation of this circuit predisposes wild-type (but not DISC-1) mice to display impaired reality testing.

Passing the torch: The ascendance of the glutamatergic synapse in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.,"For nearly fifty years, the dopamine hypothesis has dominated our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and provided the lone target for drug development. However, with the exception of clozapine, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonizing anti-psychotic drugs have little impact on the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, aspects of the disorder that robustly predict outcome. Pathologic studies reveal cortical atrophy and wide-spread loss of glutamatergic synaptic spines, unexplained by dopaminergic malfunction. Recent genome-wide association studies indicate that at least thirty risk genes for schizophrenia encode proteins localized to the glutamatergic synapse and inhibit glutamate neurotransmission, especially at the NMDA receptor. To function, the NMDA receptor requires the binding of glycine (primarily in the cerebellum and brainstem) or D-serine (in forebrain) to the NR1 channel subunit of the NMDA receptor. Genetically silencing the gene (srr) encoding serine racemase, the biosynthetic enzyme for D-serine, results in forebrain NMDA receptor hypofunction. The srr-/- mice have 90 % loss of endogenous D-serine and approximately 70 % decrease in NMDA receptor function. Several animal models of schizophrenia are based on behavioral and pharmacologic strategies, which have negligible validity with regard to the fundamental etiology of schizophrenia. We summarize here the results of a mouse model, in which srr, one of the two dozen or more risk gene for schizophrenia that affect NMDA receptor function, has been inactivated. The srr-/- mice exhibit striking similarities to schizophrenia including cortical atrophy, loss of cortico-limbic glutamatergic synapses, increased sub-cortical dopamine release, EEG abnormalities, and cognitive impairments. The limited efficacy of drugs targeting the glutamatergic synapse on DSM-5 diagnosed criteria for schizophrenia used in clinical trials may reflect the fact that only 30 % of the patients have impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission, resulting from the genetic heterogeneity of the disorder.",2024
Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with prefrontal-striatal functional hypoconnectivity and striatal dopaminergic abnormalities.,"A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is imperative, as it causes poor functional outcomes and a lack of effective treatments. This study aimed to investigate the relationships of two proposed main pathophysiology of schizophrenia, altered prefrontal-striatal connectivity and the dopamine system, with cognitive impairment and their interactions. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy controls (HCs) who are right-handed and matched for age and sex were recruited. We evaluated their cognition, functional connectivity (FC) between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)/middle frontal gyrus (MiFG) and striatum, and the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using a cognitive battery investigating attention, memory, and executive function, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging with group independent component analysis and single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited poorer cognitive performance, reduced FC between DLPFC/MiFG and the caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen, decreased DAT availability in the left CN, and decreased right-left DAT asymmetry in the CN compared to HCs. In patients with schizophrenia, altered imaging markers are associated with cognitive impairments, especially the relationship between DLPFC/MiFG-putamen FC and attention and between DAT asymmetry in the CN and executive function. This study is the first to demonstrate how prefrontal-striatal hypoconnectivity and altered striatal DAT markers are associated with different domains of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. More research is needed to evaluate their complex relationships and potential therapeutic implications.",2024
New Drug Treatments for Schizophrenia: A Review of Approaches to Target Circuit Dysfunction.,"Schizophrenia is a leading cause of global disease burden. Current drug treatments are associated with significant side effects and have limited efficacy for many patients, highlighting the need to develop new approaches that target other aspects of the neurobiology of schizophrenia. Preclinical, in vivo imaging, postmortem, genetic, and pharmacological studies have highlighted the key role of cortical GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic)-glutamatergic microcircuits and their projections to subcortical dopaminergic circuits in the pathoetiology of negative, cognitive, and psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotics primarily act downstream of the dopaminergic component of this circuit. However, multiple drugs are currently in development that could target other elements of this circuit to treat schizophrenia. These include drugs for GABAergic or glutamatergic targets, including glycine transporters, D-amino acid oxidase, sodium channels, or potassium channels. Other drugs in development are likely to primarily act on pathways that regulate the dopaminergic system, such as muscarinic or trace amine receptors or 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, while PDE10A inhibitors are being developed to modulate the downstream consequences of dopaminergic dysfunction. Our review considers where new drugs may act on this circuit and their latest clinical trial evidence in terms of indication, efficacy, and side effects. Limitations of the circuit model, including whether there are neurobiologically distinct subgroups of patients, and future directions are also considered. Several drugs based on the mechanisms reviewed have promising clinical data, with the muscarinic agonist KarXT most advanced. If these drugs are approved for clinical use, they have the potential to revolutionize understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.",2024
Correlation between toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia in Egyptian patients and its impact on dopamine serum levels.,"Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite infecting around one-third of the global population, has been linked to neurological disorders like schizophrenia. Abnormal dopamine levels are linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, but their association remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between T. gondii seroprevalence and dopamine serum levels in schizophrenic patients in Egypt. This case-control study included 93 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 93 individuals as controls. T. gondii seroprevalence was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dopamine serum levels were measured using ELISA. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were also collected. The study found a higher prevalence of T. gondii IgG antibodies in patients with schizophrenia (68 %) compared to controls (46.2 %). Contact with cats, sausage consumption, and undercooked meat were identified as possible risk factors associated with T. gondii infection. The mean level of serum dopamine was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in patients with schizophrenia (115.3 Pg/ml ±31.8) compared to the control group (75.02 Pg/ml ±26.5). The study found that schizophrenic patients with T. gondii seropositivity had significantly higher dopamine serum levels (mean=145.2 ± 32.1 pg/ml) than those without T. gondii seropositivity (mean=122.5 ± 29.7 pg/ml) (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that T. gondii seropositivity was a significant predictor of increased dopamine serum levels in schizophrenic patients (odds ratio=3.4, 95 % confidence interval=1.8-6.4, p < 0.001). The study suggests that T. gondii seroprevalence may increase dopamine serum levels in Egyptian schizophrenic patients, potentially contributing to dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia, but further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms.",2024
Understanding the role of early life stress and schizophrenia on anxiety and depressive like outcomes: An experimental study.,"Adverse experiences due to early life stress (ELS) or parental psychopathology such as schizophrenia (SZ) have a significant implication on individual susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in the future. However, it is not fully understood how ELS affects social-associated behaviors as well as the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ELS and ketamine induced schizophrenia like symptoms (KSZ) on anhedonia, social behavior and anxiety-like behavior. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups were allocated randomly into eight experimental groups, namely control, gestational stress (GS), GS+KSZ, maternal separation (MS), MS+KSZ pups, KSZ parents, KSZ parents and Pups and KSZ pups only. ELS was induced by subjecting the pups to GS and MS, while schizophrenia like symptoms was induced through subcutaneous administration of ketamine. Behavioral assessment included sucrose preference test (SPT) and elevated plus maze (EPM), followed by dopamine testing and analysis of astrocyte density. Statistical analysis involved ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests, revealing significant group differences and yielding insights into behavioral and neurodevelopmental impacts. GS, MS, and KSZ (dams) significantly reduced hedonic response and increased anxiety-like responses (p < 0.05). Notably, the presence of normal parental mental health demonstrated a reversal of the observed decline in Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein-positive astrocytes (GFAP+ astrocytes) (p < 0.05) and a reduction in anxiety levels, implying its potential protective influence on depressive-like symptoms and PFC astrocyte functionality. The present study provides empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that exposure to ELS and KSZ on dams have a significant impact on the on development of anxiety and depressive like symptoms in Sprague Dawley rats, while positive parenting has a reversal effect.",2024
Chronic social stressors and striatal dopamine functioning in humans: A systematic review of SPECT and PET studies.,"The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia posits that elevated striatal dopamine functioning underlies the development of psychotic symptoms. Chronic exposure to social stressors increases psychosis risk, possibly by upregulating striatal dopamine functioning. Here we systematically review single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies that examined the relationship between chronic social stress exposure and in vivo striatal dopamine functioning in humans. We searched the scientific databases PubMed and PsycINFO from inception to August 2023. The quality of the included studies was evaluated with the ten-item Observational Study Quality Evaluation (PROSPERO: CRD42022308883). Twenty-eight studies were included, which measured different aspects of striatal dopamine functioning including dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 binding, dopamine release following a pharmacological or behavioral challenge, D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor binding, and dopamine transporter binding. We observed preliminary evidence of an association between childhood trauma and increased striatal DSC and dopamine release. However, exposure to low socioeconomic status, stressful life events, or other social stressors was not consistently associated with altered striatal dopamine functioning. The quality of available studies was generally low. In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence that chronic social stressors upregulate striatal dopamine functioning in humans. We propose avenues for future research, in particular to improve the measurement of chronic social stressors and the methodological quality of study designs.",2024
Dopamine signaling enriched striatal gene set predicts striatal dopamine synthesis and physiological activity in vivo.,"The polygenic architecture of schizophrenia implicates several molecular pathways involved in synaptic function. However, it is unclear how polygenic risk funnels through these pathways to translate into syndromic illness. Using tensor decomposition, we analyze gene co-expression in the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of post-mortem brain samples from 358 individuals. We identify a set of genes predominantly expressed in the caudate nucleus and associated with both clinical state and genetic risk for schizophrenia that shows dopaminergic selectivity. A higher polygenic risk score for schizophrenia parsed by this set of genes predicts greater dopamine synthesis in the striatum and greater striatal activation during reward anticipation. These results translate dopamine-linked genetic risk variation into in vivo neurochemical and hemodynamic phenotypes in the striatum that have long been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",2024
"Plasma neuropeptide levels in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder and healthy controls: A multiplex immunoassay study.","We aimed to compare neuropeptide levels between patients with major psychiatric disorders and healthy controls and examine their association with symptoms and cognitive function. The participants were 149 patients with schizophrenia, 115 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 186 unremitted patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 350 healthy controls. Psychiatric (schizophrenic, manic, and depressive) symptoms, sleep state, and cognitive (premorbid intelligence quotient, general cognitive, and memory) functions were evaluated. A multiplex immunoassay kit was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels. The verification assay revealed that CSF α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were too low to be reliably measured, while plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels could be successfully measured. Plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and healthy controls. Plasma α-MSH, β-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and cognitive function scores in patients or healthy controls. Our data suggest that plasma neuropeptide levels do not elucidate the involvement of neuropeptides in the pathology of schizophrenia, BD, or MDD.",2023
Plasma β-Endorphin Concentration and Antipsychotic Treatment Outcome in Schizophrenia: 1-Year Follow-Up.,"BACKGROUND Increased levels of endogenous opioids have been observed in patients with schizophrenia; however, the influence of these endogenous opioids on the biology of schizophrenia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of beta-endorphin (BE) on the course of schizophrenia and risk of relapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 25 patients hospitalized with schizophrenia and 47 controls. Their symptoms were evaluated using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and composite index at five points: at the onset of hospitalization; after 4, 6 and 10 weeks of treatment; and after 12 months. ß-endorphin plasma concentrations were assessed in patients at study enrollment and after 6 weeks of treatment. Data regarding rehospitalization during follow-up were also collected. RESULTS Patients had higher BE concentration than controls at study enrollment (P=0.002) and after 6 weeks (P=0.000). BE levels increased during treatment (mean 0.538ng/mL vs. mean 0.624 ng/mL; P=0.007). No correlation was found between BE concentration and PANSS subscale score at any stage of the study. A higher BE level at study enrollment was related to a predominance of negative symptoms after 1 year, measured with composite index (R=-0.404; P=0.045). Patients who were later hospitalized again were significantly more likely to demonstrate an increase in BE levels over 6 weeks (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated higher BE concentrations than healthy controls; this tendency was particularly apparent in those affected by negative symptoms. The imbalance in the endogenous opioid system might adversely alter the course of disease and predispose patients to persistence of negative symptoms, despite antipsychotic treatment.",2020
Overrated hedonic judgment of odors in patients with schizophrenia.,"The odor identification ability and its hedonic judgment in patients with schizophrenia were evaluated in the study. The association between olfactory performance and negative symptoms and β-endorphin concentration was also analyzed. Study groups consisted of 23 patients with negative symptoms (PN) and 25 without predominant negative symptoms (PP) and 21 healthy individuals. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, odor hedonic evaluation, and plasma concentrations of β-endorphin assay in all participants were performed. PN perceived the poorer olfactory identification; nevertheless, they evaluated unpleasant odors as more pleasant than PP and controls. Beta-endorphin concentration was significantly higher among PN than in other study groups. No association was observed between β-endorphin and odors identification and odor hedonic judgment among all study groups. There is potential relationship between increased β-endorphin concentration and severity of negative symptoms. Patients with predominant negative symptoms tend to evaluate odors as significantly more pleasant. Individuals with this subtype of schizophrenia might present specific, altered pattern of smell identification and hedonic judgment. Presumably, β-endorphin has no direct influence on olfactory identification performance and hedonic judgment in schizophrenia.",2018
Olfactory identification in patients with schizophrenia - the influence of β-endorphin and calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations.,"The relationship between the olfactory system and emotional processing is an area of growing interest in schizophrenia research. Both the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in the processing of olfactory information, and olfactory deficits may be also influenced by endogenous opioids and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is probably involved in dopaminergic transmission. However, the relationship between endorphins and dopaminergic transmission has not been fully explored. Odor identification performance and valence interaction was evaluated among 50 schizophrenic patients and 50 controls. Schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). All study participants were subjected to the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), blood β-endorphin (BE) and CGRP measurement. Insignificantly higher BE concentrations were observed in the patient group, while significantly higher UPSIT scores were seen in controls (mean UPSIT 32.48 vs 26.82). The patients demonstrated significantly more identification errors for pleasant (P=0.000) and neutral (P=0.055) odors than for unpleasant odors. Patients with higher BE concentrations made more identification errors concerning pleasant (R<sub>s</sub>=-0.292; P=0.04) and neutral odors (R<sub>s</sub>=-0.331; P=0.019). Although the concentration of CGRP was significantly higher in the patient sample (P<0.001), no relationship was observed between concentration and UPSIT performance. A strong negative correlation was observed between PANSS N score and UPSIT total score (R<sub>s</sub>=-0.646; P=0.000), between PANSS N score and identification by valence for pleasant and neutral odors (UPSIT n/16: R<sub>s</sub>=-0.450, P=0.001; UPSIT n/15: R<sub>s</sub>=-0.586, P=0.000), and a weak negative correlation between PANSS N score and identification of unpleasant odors (UPSIT n/9: R<sub>s</sub>=-0.325, P=0.021). Schizophrenic patients present a unique pattern of smell identification characterized by aberrant hedonic ratings for pleasant odors but not unpleasant ones. Individuals with predominant negative symptoms and higher BE concentrations are most able to identify negative odors.",2017
Health Promotion for Young Adults With Serious Mental Illness.,"Young adulthood represents a critical time to address elevated obesity rates and the risk of early mortality, particularly among people with serious mental illness. Few studies have assessed the benefits of lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss among these young adults. This study examined the impact of the 12-month In SHAPE lifestyle intervention on weight loss and fitness among overweight and obese young adults with serious mental illness (ages 21-30) compared with participants over age 30. Data were combined from three trials of the 12-month In SHAPE program delivered through community mental health centers. In SHAPE includes weekly fitness trainer meetings, a gym membership, and nutrition education. Primary outcomes were weight loss and change in fitness at 12 months. Participants (N=194) had a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (53%) or a mood disorder (47%). The overall sample achieved significant weight loss and improved fitness; differences between young adults (N=29) and participants over age 30 (N=165) were not significant. An important finding was that 42% of young adults achieved clinically significant reductions in cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥5% weight loss or improved fitness (>50-m increase on the 6-Minute Walk Test), compared with 54% of adults over age 30 (a nonsignificant difference between age groups). Among persons enrolled in a lifestyle intervention, overweight and obese young adults experienced benefits comparable with those of adults over age 30. Young adults with serious mental illness face high risk of gaining weight, but a meaningful proportion of these individuals can achieve clinically significant cardiovascular risk reduction, thus highlighting the need to promote lifestyle intervention participation in this group.",2017
Nardilysin in human brain diseases: both friend and foe.,"Nardilysin is a metalloprotease that cleaves peptides, such as dynorphin-A, α-neoendorphin, and glucagon, at the N-terminus of arginine and lysine residues in dibasic moieties. It has various functionally important molecular interaction partners (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, tumour necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, neuregulin 1, beta-secretase 1, malate dehydrogenase, P42(IP4)/centaurin-α1, the histone H3 dimethyl Lys4, and others) and is involved in a plethora of normal brain functions. Less is known about possible implications of nardilysin for brain diseases. This review, which includes some of our own recent findings, attempts to summarize the current knowledge on possible roles of nardilysin in Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, mood disorders, alcohol abuse, heroin addiction, and cancer. We herein show that nardilysin is a Janus-faced enzyme with regard to brain pathology, being probably neuropathogenic in some diseases, but neuroprotective in others.",2013
Cathepsin K generates enkephalin from beta-endorphin: a new mechanism with possible relevance for schizophrenia.,"Recent studies associate cathepsin K with schizophrenia. The endogenous substrates of this protease, however, remain to be identified. We show here that cathepsin K is capable of liberating met-enkephalin from beta-endorphin (beta-EP) in vitro. To verify if this process might possibly contribute in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia post mortem brains of patients suffering from this disease were analysed immunohistochemically for the presence and co-localization of cathepsin K and beta-EP. In support of a functional role of the observed formation of met-enkephalin on the expense of beta-EP increased numbers of cathepsin K immunoreactive cells, but diminished numbers of both beta-EP-positive cells and double-positive (cathepsin K/beta-EP) cells were found in left and right arcuate nucleus of schizophrenics. In addition a reduced density of beta-EP-immunoreactive neuropil (fibres, nerve terminals) was estimated in the left and right paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of individuals with schizophrenia. Our results imply that cathepsin K, which becomes up-regulated in its cerebral expression by neuroleptic treatment, might significantly contribute to altered opioid levels in brains of schizophrenics, which have previously been reported by us and others, and might reinforce the interest in the putative roles of endorphin and enkephalins in neuropsychiatric disorders.",2009
Fewer beta-endorphin expressing arcuate nucleus neurons and reduced beta-endorphinergic innervation of paraventricular neurons in schizophrenics and patients with depression.,"In order to elucidate whether the hypothalamic expression of beta-endorphin is altered in patients with mental disorders we studied the cellular localization of the peptide in arcuate nucleus neurons as well as the beta-endorphinergic innervation of paraventricular neurons in nine schizophrenics, six subjects with depression, and nine controls. A polyclonal antiserum against beta-endorphin was employed for the immunohistochemical detection of the peptide in sections of postmortem human brains. Quantitative analysis revealed that the number of beta-endorphin-containing arcuate neurons was statistically reduced in schizophrenics and depressives in comparison to controls. Moreover, the number of endorphinoceptive (i.e. beta-endorphin-innervated) paraventricular nerve cells was also lower in psychiatric patients than in control cases. Our results showing an altered endorphinergic system in human hypothalami of schizophrenics and depressives might contribute to a renewal of interest in this peptide as a possible factor of importance in psychiatric disorders.",2002
"Cholecystokinin, beta-endorphin and vasoactive intestinal peptide in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of drug-naive schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol compared to healthy controls.","Cholecystokinin (CCK), beta-endorphin (BE), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 drug-naive schizophrenics compared to 22 healthy controls were studied. Patients were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of the Negative Symptoms (SANS) at baseline (TO), and after four weeks (T4) in nine patients who were subsequently treated with haloperidol (HL). Neuropeptide concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were measured at TO and, for the treated patients, at T4. There was a negative correlation between CCK and SANS baseline scores and a trend for patients who responded poorly to HL (i.e. patients with a prevalence of negative symptomatology) to have lower CCK basal values.",1998
Multiple HPA profiles in endogenous depression: effect of age and sex on cortisol and beta-endorphin.,"We have previously shown that a number of depressed patients demonstrated a failure to suppress corticotrophic secretion, as measured by beta-Endorphin/beta-Lipotropin (beta-End/beta-LPH levels), following dexamethasone challenge. The current study is an extension and replication of these findings, as well as an analysis of some of the biological variables which may contribute to the variance in beta-End/beta-LPH nonsuppression. We continue to observe a high rate of beta-End/beta-LPH nonsuppression in depressed patients following dexamethasone; this escape at the pituitary level is even observed in a number of patients who demonstrate normal cortisol suppression. Advancing age, particularly in women, led to higher baseline cortisol, lower baseline beta-End/beta-LPH, and a greater likelihood of being a nonsuppressor on one or both measures.",1993
Brain and gut neuropeptides in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,"Neuropeptides, initially thought to be common features of gut and brain, are only synthesized in immune cells and modulate immune functions. The presence and possible functions of these peptides in immune cells in both physiological or pathological conditions have been investigated in our laboratory in the last years. Some of the data obtained are reviewed here, and future developments of the field are indicated.",1993
A comprehensive macrophage-T-lymphocyte theory of schizophrenia.,"Chronic macrophage activation with subsequent failure of activated macrophages to properly control T-lymphocyte secretion of interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptors is proposed as the basic biological mechanism of schizophrenia. Fundamental to this theory are the clinical observations on interleukin-2 provoking the active phase symptoms of schizophrenia in psychiatrically normal human volunteers and macrophage cytokines producing the prodromal and residual phase symptoms. This theory provides a completely new and unified mechanisms for the antipsychotic action of typical and atypical neuroleptics, bromocriptine, naloxone and DMSO. Furthermore, this hypothesis reveals why the dopamine theory of schizophrenia was a false lead. The effects of prolactin, estrogens and androgens are consistent with the model. Age of onset, male/female incidence, course of the disease from prodromal to active to residual phase, the protection afforded by rheumatoid arthritis and the close relationship between depression and schizophrenia can be explained by this theory. The gastrointestinal tract is suggested as the preferred site to investigate for the cause of the immune activation in schizophrenia.",1992
Inadequate treatment response to des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin compared with thioridazine and placebo in schizophrenia.,"The possibility of an involvement of peptidergic systems in schizophrenia has been under investigation for a number of years. Studies of the efficacy of des-tyr-gamma-endorphin were equivocal; more recent studies with des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin have reported some activity but the peptide has only been investigated as an adjunct to neuroleptic medication, apart from one very small active reference comparator study. In the multicentre study reported here, 96 patients suffering from schizophrenia (DSM-III with a current exacerbation if chronic) were allocated randomly to double-blind treatment with either des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin (DE-gamma-E) (Org 5878) 10 mg given as a once daily intramuscular injection for 4 weeks, thioridazine 400 mg orally in 2 divided doses or placebo using a double-dummy technique to preserve blindness. There was a significant advantage for thioridazine compared with placebo registered on all measures at weeks 3 and 4. There was no difference between DE-gamma-E and placebo. There was a significant difference between thioridazine and DE-gamma-E at weeks 3 and 4 registered on the MSS and at week 3 registered on the BPRS. The lack of efficacy of DE-gamma-E suggests that the theories that the endorphins have an important role in schizophrenia have to be revised. The need for well designed placebo controlled studies for assessing efficacy in schizophrenia is emphasized.",1992
"Beta-endorphin, vasoactive intestinal peptide and cholecystokinin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and from drug-free and haloperidol-treated schizophrenic patients.","Beta-endorphin, cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal peptide were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy controls, and schizophrenic patients at the first diagnosis before any treatment and after 2 or 15 d of treatment with haloperidol. Beta-endorphin concentrations were similar in controls and untreated patients, and increased with treatment. Cholecystokinin concentrations were higher in patients than in controls, and decreased during treatment. Vasoactive intestinal peptide was lower in patients and did not change with treatment. These observations are consistent with measurements of the same peptides in autopsy samples or cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells might be an useful tool for the study of some neuropeptides in brain.",1992

Des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin in the treatment of schizophrenia.,"Ninety-three patients with an exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia were included in a 4 week trial comparing placebo with 1, 3 and 10 mg des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin (DE gamma E; beta-lipotrophin 66-77; Org 5878) per day (i.m.). Maintenance antipsychotic and other medications were continued unchanged. Treatment effects were assessed by means of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale--subscale schizophrenia (CPRS-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Global Assessment Scale (GAS) rating scales at weekly intervals. Safety data, i.e. laboratory investigations, vital signs and ECG recordings, were assessed before and during the trial. Side-effects were evaluated by means of a Record of Symptoms Emerging. Sixty-eight patients completed the trial, the reason for drop-out mainly being inadequate treatment effects and refusal of medication administration. One patient violated the protocol. After 4 weeks of treatment the mean CPRS-S score of the group receiving 10 mg DE gamma E daily had decreased statistically significantly more than the corresponding score of the placebo group (p less than 0.01). The same trend was apparent with BPRS (p = 0.08) and GAS (p greater than 0.1) scores. Therefore, the study should be considered inconclusive. No clinically relevant side-effects attributable to DE gamma E were observed.",1990

Experimental approaches to human stress research: assessment of neurobiological mechanisms of stress in volunteers and psychiatric patients.,"This article presents a series of experiments that involves the development of three novel strategies for human stress research and the utilization of these strategies to examine neurobehavioral processes of stress in healthy volunteers, schizophrenia, and affective illness. The first strategy involved intravenous 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) administration, a glucoprivic stressor. We found that glucoprivic stress results in dissociation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), adrenomedullary, and sympathoneural activity. In addition, glucoprivic stress in neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients caused heightened dopamine activity, as reflected by increased plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels and decreased adaptive responses as assessed by decreased food consumption following 2DG administration. These data suggest that neuroleptics do not prevent stress-related increases in dopamine activity and that schizophrenia may be associated with abnormalities in the stress response. The second strategy assessed effects of uncontrollable and identical amounts of controllable stress in volunteers and depressed patients. In volunteers, it was found that uncontrollable in comparison to controllable stress results in specific behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations. Moreover, uncontrollable stress exposure in depressed patients in comparison to volunteers produced greater alterations in behavioral ratings and plasma cortisol levels and that the uncontrollable stress related increases in helplessness ratings and cortisol levels were significantly correlated. These data suggest that depressed patients may have increased sensitivity to uncontrollable stress and that there may be an important interrelationship between the cognitive deficits of depression and the heightened HPA axis activity observed in these patients. Lastly, we used a naturalistic strategy to examine mechanisms relating childhood parental loss and the development of adult affective illness and found that among subjects with early parental loss histories, those who developed adult psychiatric illness had increased resting plasma levels of cortisol and beta-endorphin (ir) as compared with subjects with early loss and no adult history of psychiatric illness. Moreover, increased HPA activity in adulthood was significantly related to poor childhood adjustment to parental loss. The implications of the results of these studies are discussed.",1989
Criteria for evaluating improvement in schizophrenia in psychopharmacological research (with special reference to gamma endorphin fragments).,"A review of treatment trials with DT gamma E revealed widely discrepant results. Relevant variables were the variety of measures employed for monitoring psychotic symptoms, and the different criteria used to judge the degree of improvement. The authors suggest a uniform outcome criterion for early trials of new treatments, which would generate more consistent and comparable results between studies, and give a stronger indication of the value of the treatment under test. When the data from the various treatment trials of DT gamma E were reanalysed, applying a uniform outcome criterion of improvement of a change of 80% or more on rating-scale score, the results were more consistent than would have been suspected from the original reports.",1988

Disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolites in peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine: a preliminary targeted metabolomic study.,"The aim of this research was to characterize changes in peripheral blood neurotransmitter metabolites in olanzapine-treated schizophrenia (SCZ) and to identify potential biomarkers for SCZ. Concurrently, the relationship between these differential neurotransmitters and cognitive function is explored. We recruited 40 SCZ treated with single-agent olanzapine and 40 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive function and psychopathology were assessed using the MCCB and PANSS, respectively. Neurotransmitter levels were determined by targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). SCZ showed cognitive impairment in all domains of the MCCB compared to HC. Interestingly, a 4-neurotransmitter panel consisting of 3-Methoxytyramine hydrochloride (3-MT), 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetate (DOPAC), arginine, and r-aminobutyric acid (GABA) illustrated the highest determinative score between SCZ and HC. Arginine was positively correlated with PANSS general psychopathology scores. 3-MT independently predicted the verbal learning scores only in SCZ, whereas GABA independently predicted the social cognition scores only. Furthermore, GABA independently predicted the working memory scores only in HC. The collective assessment of these four neurotransmitters (3-MT, DOPAC, arginine, and GABA) holds considerable promise as potential biomarkers for SCZ. Moreover, 3-MT and GABA may enhance our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ, particularly in areas of verbal learning and social cognitive dysfunction.",2025
"Glutamate, GABA and NAA in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: A systematic review of the effect of clozapine and group differences between clozapine-responders and non-responders.","Treatment-resistance in patients with schizophrenia is a major obstacle for improving outcome in patients, especially in those not gaining from clozapine. Novel research implies that glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities may be present in treatment-resistant patients, and preclinical research suggests that clozapine affects the GABAergic system. Moreover, clozapine may have a neuroprotective role. To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relationship between clozapine and in vivo measures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (glu), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) brain levels in treatment- and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (TRS and UTRS). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we included three longitudinal and six cross sectional studies utilizing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) that explored brain metabolite levels in clozapine-treated patients. Findings were limited by a small number of studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn, but the present studies may imply that clozapine reduces glutamate levels in striatal but not cortical areas, whereas glutamatergic metabolites and GABA levels may be increased in ACC in the combined group of TRS and UTRS. Clozapine may also increase NAA in cortical areas. Importantly, this review highlights the need for further clinical studies investigating the effect of clozapine on brain levels of glutamate, GABA, and NAA as well as metabolite group differences in patients with UTRS compared with TRS.",2025
"What's GABA got to do with it? A potential link between the microbiome, schizophrenia, and the endo-cannabinoid system.","The microbiome has been linked to numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. Nevertheless, correlating microbial perturbations to pathophysiological aspects of schizophrenia remains elusive, as study participants are typically medicated when sampled, complicating mechanistic investigation. Here we explored specific microbial and metabolic alterations in schizophrenia patients, while explicitly considering their medications. We recruited 30 patients and 14 healthy controls. Fecal and serum samples were collected for microbiota and (untargeted) metabolome characterization, respectively. While significant differences were detected between microbiome of controls and schizophrenia patients overall, patients not taking GABA-enhancing drugs had profiles similar to the control group. This pattern was preserved, but to a lesser extent, when comparing metabolomes. Several key metabolic pathways differed between patients and controls, even after filtering out those directly related to pharmaceuticals and their metabolism, and the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis pathways were enriched in the group prescribed antipsychotics without GABA-enhancers. Administration of exogenous GABA affected overall patient homeostasis, not just disease course, supporting our hypothesis that microbiota play a part in cognitive, emotional, and mental function, and that this role must be considered in the full context of an individual's state, including medication.",2024
Schizophrenia-Like Deficits and Impaired Glutamate/Gamma-aminobutyric acid Homeostasis in Zfp804a Conditional Knockout Mice.,"Zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) was the first genome-wide associated susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (SCZ) and played an essential role in the pathophysiology of SCZ by influencing neurodevelopment regulation, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and RNA translational control; however, the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. A nervous-system-specific Zfp804a (ZNF804A murine gene) conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 technology and the Cre/loxP method. Multiple and complex SCZ-like behaviors, such as anxiety, depression, and impaired cognition, were observed in Zfp804a cKO mice. Molecular biological methods and targeted metabolomics assay validated that Zfp804a cKO mice displayed altered SATB2 (a cortical superficial neuron marker) expression in the cortex; aberrant NeuN, cleaved caspase 3, and DLG4 (markers of mature neurons, apoptosis, and postsynapse, respectively) expressions in the hippocampus and a loss of glutamate (Glu)/γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) homeostasis with abnormal GAD67 (Gad1) expression in the hippocampus. Clozapine partly ameliorated some SCZ-like behaviors, reversed the disequilibrium of the Glu/GABA ratio, and recovered the expression of GAD67 in cKO mice. Zfp804a cKO mice reproducing SCZ-like pathological and behavioral phenotypes were successfully developed. A novel mechanism was determined in which Zfp804a caused Glu/GABA imbalance and reduced GAD67 expression, which was partly recovered by clozapine treatment. These findings underscore the role of altered gene expression in understanding the pathogenesis of SCZ and provide a reliable SCZ model for future therapeutic interventions and biomarker discovery.",2024
Integrative metabolomics-genomics analysis identifies key networks in a stem cell-based model of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neuropsychiatric disorder, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The etiology behind the disorder remains elusive although it is hypothesized to be associated with the aberrant response to neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate. Therefore, investigating the link between dysregulated metabolites and distorted neurodevelopment holds promise to offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of this complex disorder. In this study, we aimed to explore a presumed correlation between the transcriptome and the metabolome in a SCZ model based on patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For this, iPSCs were differentiated towards cortical neurons and samples were collected longitudinally at various developmental stages, reflecting neuroepithelial-like cells, radial glia, young and mature neurons. The samples were analyzed by both RNA-sequencing and targeted metabolomics and the two modalities were used to construct integrative networks in silico. This multi-omics analysis revealed significant perturbations in the polyamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthetic pathways during rosette maturation in SCZ lines. We particularly observed the downregulation of the glutamate decarboxylase encoding genes GAD1 and GAD2, as well as their protein product GAD65/67 and their biochemical product GABA in SCZ samples. Inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase resulted in further decrease of GABA levels suggesting a compensatory activation of the ornithine/putrescine pathway as an alternative route for GABA production. These findings indicate an imbalance of cortical excitatory/inhibitory dynamics occurring during early neurodevelopmental stages in SCZ. Our study supports the hypothesis of disruption of inhibitory circuits to be causative for SCZ and establishes a novel in silico approach that enables for integrative correlation of metabolic and transcriptomic data of psychiatric disease models.",2024
Pregabalin Adjuventia Helped Risperidone-Induced Extrapyramidal Syndrome and Augmented Antipsychotic Response in an Adolescent with Schizophrenia.,"Here, authors report on an interesting case of early-onset of schizophrenia where adjunctive pregabalin alleviated risperidone-induced pseudoparkinsonism, helped with insomnia and agitation and boosted antipsychotic response with great tolerability. We wager that gabapentenoids can be a viable option in the niche of psychopharmacotherapy of schizophrenia in CAP population.",2024
Endocannabinoid levels in plasma and neurotransmitters in the brain: a preliminary report on patients with a psychotic disorder and healthy individuals.,"Interactions between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and neurotransmitter systems might mediate the risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Consequently, we investigated in patients with SSD and healthy controls (HC) the relations between (1) plasma concentrations of two prototypical endocannabinoids (N-arachidonoylethanolamine [anandamide] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) and (2) striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), and glutamate and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As anandamide and 2-AG might reduce the activity of these neurotransmitters, we hypothesized negative correlations between their plasma levels and the abovementioned neurotransmitters in both groups. Blood samples were obtained from 18 patients and 16 HC to measure anandamide and 2-AG plasma concentrations. For all subjects, we acquired proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans to assess Glx (i.e. glutamate plus glutamine) and GABA + (i.e. GABA plus macromolecules) concentrations in the ACC. Ten patients and 14 HC also underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DOPA positron emission tomography for assessment of striatal DSC. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relations between the outcome measures. A negative association between 2-AG plasma concentration and ACC Glx concentration was found in patients (<i>p</i> = 0.008). We found no evidence of other significant relationships between 2-AG or anandamide plasma concentrations and dopaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic measures in either group. Our preliminary results suggest an association between peripheral 2-AG and ACC Glx levels in patients.",2024
"GABAergic and inflammatory changes in the frontal cortex following neonatal PCP plus isolation rearing, as a dual-hit neurodevelopmental model for schizophrenia.","The pathogenesis of schizophrenia begins in early neurodevelopment and leads to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. It is therefore essential that preclinical models used to understand disease, select drug targets and evaluate novel therapeutics encompass similar neurochemical deficits. One approach to improved preclinical modelling incorporates dual-hit neurodevelopmental insults, like neonatal administration of phencyclidine (PCP, to disrupt development of glutamatergic circuitry) then post-weaning isolation (Iso, to mimic adolescent social stress). We recently showed that male Lister-hooded rats exposed to PCP-Iso exhibit reduced hippocampal expression of the GABA interneuron marker calbindin. The current study expanded on this by investigating changes to additional populations of GABAergic interneurons in frontal cortical and hippocampal tissue from the same animals (by immunohistochemistry) as well as levels of GABA itself (via ELISA). Because inflammatory changes are also implicated in schizophrenia, we performed additional immunohistochemical evaluations of Iba-1 positive microglia as well as ELISA analysis of IL-6 in the same brain regions. Single-hit isolation-reared and dual-hit PCP-Iso rats both showed reduced parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the prelimbic/infralimbic region of the frontal cortex. However, this was more widespread in PCP-Iso, extending to the medial/ventral and lateral/dorsolateral orbitofrontal cortices. Loss of GABAergic markers was accompanied by increased microglial activation in the medial/ventral orbitofrontal cortices of PCP-Iso, together with frontal cortical IL-6 elevations not seen following single-hit isolation rearing. These findings enhance the face validity of PCP-Iso, and we advocate the use of this preclinical model for future evaluation of novel therapeutics-especially those designed to normalise excitatory-inhibitory imbalance or reduce neuroinflammation.",2024
Altered Rbfox1-Vamp1 pathway and prefrontal cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia.,"Deficient gamma oscillations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of individuals with schizophrenia appear to involve impaired inhibitory drive from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs). Inhibitory drive from PVIs is regulated, in part, by RNA binding fox-1 homolog 1 (Rbfox1). Rbfox1 is spliced into nuclear or cytoplasmic isoforms, which regulate alternative splicing or stability of their target transcripts, respectively. One major target of cytoplasmic Rbfox1 is vesicle associated membrane protein 1 (Vamp1). Vamp1 mediates GABA release probability from PVIs, and the loss of Rbfox1 reduces Vamp1 levels which in turn impairs cortical inhibition. In this study, we investigated if the Rbfox1-Vamp1 pathway is altered in PVIs in PFC of individuals with schizophrenia by utilizing a novel strategy that combines multi-label in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In the PFC of 20 matched pairs of schizophrenia and comparison subjects, cytoplasmic Rbfox1 protein levels were significantly lower in PVIs in schizophrenia and this deficit was not attributable to potential methodological confounds or schizophrenia-associated co-occurring factors. In a subset of this cohort, Vamp1 mRNA levels in PVIs were also significantly lower in schizophrenia and were predicted by lower cytoplasmic Rbfox1 protein levels across individual PVIs. To investigate the functional impact of Rbfox1-Vamp1 alterations in schizophrenia, we simulated the effect of lower GABA release probability from PVIs on gamma power in a computational model network of pyramidal neurons and PVIs. Our simulations showed that lower GABA release probability reduces gamma power by disrupting network synchrony while minimally affecting network activity. Finally, lower GABA release probability synergistically interacted with lower strength of inhibition from PVIs in schizophrenia to reduce gamma power non-linearly. Together, our findings suggest that the Rbfox1-Vamp1 pathway in PVIs is impaired in schizophrenia and that this alteration likely contributes to deficient PFC gamma power in the illness.",2024
Longitudinal trajectories of anterior cingulate glutamate and subclinical psychotic experiences in early adolescence: the impact of bullying victimization.,"Previous studies reported decreased glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis. However, ACC glutamatergic changes in subjects at high-risk for psychosis, and the effects of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function in adolescents remain unclear. In this study, adolescents recruited from the general population underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the pregenual ACC using a 3-Tesla scanner. We explored longitudinal data on the association of combined glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels, measured by MRS, with subclinical psychotic experiences. Moreover, we investigated associations of bullying victimization, a risk factor for subclinical psychotic experiences, and help-seeking intentions, a coping strategy against stressors including bullying victimization, with Glx levels. Finally, path analyses were conducted to explore multivariate associations. For a contrast analysis, gamma-aminobutyric acid plus macromolecule (GABA+) levels were also analyzed. Negative associations were found between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences at both Times 1 (n = 219, mean age 11.5 y) and 2 (n = 211, mean age 13.6 y), as well as for over-time changes (n = 157, mean interval 2.0 y). Moreover, effects of bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction effects on Glx levels were found (n = 156). Specifically, bullying victimization decreased Glx levels, whereas help-seeking intention increased Glx levels only in bullied adolescents. Finally, associations among bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences were revealed. GABA+ analysis revealed no significant results. This is the first adolescent study to reveal longitudinal trajectories of the association between glutamatergic function and subclinical psychotic experiences and to elucidate the effect of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function. Our findings may deepen the understanding of how environmental emotional/social stressors induce impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission that could be the underpinning of liability for psychotic experiences in early adolescence.",2024
Simultaneous determination of human plasma 5 amino acid neurotransmitters using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: Establishment of reference intervals in Chinese adult population and application to patients with schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease with unknown etiology that affects approximately 1 % of the population around the world. Altered levels of amino acid neurotransmitters may underlie the physiopathology of schizophrenia (SZ). This study aimed to develop a rapid and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous determination of glutamate acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine acid (Gly), and Taurine acid (Tau) in patients with schizophrenia plasma and establish reference intervals for Chinese adult populations, and applied to patients with schizophrenia for a preliminary exploration of changes in their plasma levels of five amino acid neurotransmitters. Sample treatment involved protein precipitation followed by dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl) derivatization and total run time is 5.8 min. The method was validated according to the latest national and international guidelines, which achieved acceptable precision (0.54-14.54 %) and accuracy (97.06-103.82 %). The reference interval for Glu, Asp, Gly, Tau, and GABA were 55.51-189.06, 27.51-92.38, 204.01-574.55, 107.50-227.65, and <1 μmol/L, respectively. Increased Tau levels and decreased Asp and Glu levels were shown in patients with schizophrenia. This method was suitable for clinical routine detection of plasma 5 amino acid neurotransmitters in Chinese adult populations.",2024
The relationship between alterations in plasma metabolites and treatment responses in antipsychotic-naïve female patients with schizophrenia.,"This study aimed to explore the relationship between alterations in plasma metabolites and treatment responses amongst antipsychotic-naïve female patients with schizophrenia. A total of 38 antipsychotic-naïve female schizophrenia patients (ANS) and 19 healthy female controls (HC) were recruited. Plasma samples were obtained from all participants, and targeted metabolomics were measured with FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) was used to assess the severity of psychotic symptoms before and after eight weeks of treatment. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were used to predict diagnostic and therapeutic responses. A total of 186 metabolites passed quality control procedures and were used in statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers. Before treatment, the ANS patients had lower levels of γ -Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and higher levels of Cholesteryl esters (CE) (20:3), Cholic Acid (CA) and Glycocholic Acid (GCA) compared to the HCs. These four differential metabonomic markers were synthesised into a combinatorial biomarker panel. This panel significantly distinguished ANS from HC. Moreover, this biomarker panel was able to effectively predict therapeutic responses. Our results suggest that plasma CE (20:3), CA, GCA, and GABA levels may be useful for diagnosing and predicting antipsychotic efficacy amongst female schizophrenia patients.",2024
Mapping alterations in the local synchrony of the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia.,"Observations from different fields of research coincide in indicating that a defective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron system may be among the primary factors accounting for the varied clinical expression of schizophrenia. GABA interneuron deficiency is locally expressed in the form of neural activity desynchronization. We mapped the functional anatomy of local synchrony in the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia using functional connectivity MRI. Data from 86 patients with schizophrenia and 137 control subjects were obtained from publicly available repositories. Resting-state functional connectivity maps based on Iso-Distant Average Correlation measures across three distances were estimated detailing the local functional structure of the cerebral cortex. Patients with schizophrenia showed weaker local functional connectivity (i.e., lower MRI signal synchrony) in (i) prefrontal lobe areas, (ii) somatosensory, auditory, visual, and motor cortices, (iii) paralimbic system at the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and (iv) hippocampus. The distribution of the defect in cortical area synchrony largely coincided with the synchronization effect of the GABA agonist alprazolam previously observed using identical functional connectivity measures. There was also a notable resemblance between the anatomy of our findings and cortical areas showing higher density of parvalbumin (prefrontal lobe and sensory cortices) and somatostatin (anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex) GABA interneurons in humans. Our results thus provide detail of the functional anatomy of synchrony changes in the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia and suggest which elements of the interneuron system are affected. Such information could ultimately be relevant in the search for specific treatments.",2023

Potassium channel modulators and schizophrenia: an overview of investigational drugs.,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness comprising positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Existing pharmacologic options exert their actions on the dopamine receptor but are largely ineffective at treating negative and cognitive symptoms. Alternative pharmacologic options that do not act directly on the dopamine receptor are being investigated, including potassium channel modulators. It has been hypothesized that dysfunctional fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive GABA interneurons, regulated by Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 potassium channels, contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia, making potassium channels an area of clinical interest. This review will highlight potassium channel modulators for the treatment of schizophrenia, with a focus on AUT00206. Background on Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 potassium channels will be explored. Our search strategy included a literature review utilizing PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, and sources available on the manufacturer's website. Initial data on potassium channel modulators is promising; however, further study is needed, and existing evidence is limited. Early data suggests that dysfunctional GABA interneurons can be ameliorated through modulators of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 channels. AUT00206 has been shown to improve dopaminergic dysfunction induced by ketamine and PCP, improve resting gamma power in patients with schizophrenia, impact dopamine synthesis capacity in a subgroup of individuals with schizophrenia, and affect reward anticipation-related neural activation.",2023
Enhanced L-β-Aminoisobutyric Acid Is Involved in the Pathophysiology of Effectiveness for Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia and Adverse Reactions of Clozapine.,"Clozapine is an effective antipsychotic for the treatment of antipsychotic-resistant schizophrenia; however, specific types of A/B adverse effects and clozapine-discontinuation syndromes are also well known. To date, both the critical mechanisms of clinical actions (effective for antipsychotic-resistant schizophrenia) and the adverse effects of clozapine remain to be elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated that clozapine increased the synthesis of L-β-aminoisobutyric acid (L-BAIBA) in the hypothalamus. L-BAIBA is an activator of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), glycine receptor, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>B</sub>-R). These targets of L-BAIBA overlap as potential targets other than the monoamine receptors of clozapine. However, the direct binding of clozapine to these aminoacidic transmitter/modulator receptors remains to be clarified. Therefore, to explore the contribution of increased L-BAIBA on the clinical action of clozapine, this study determined the effects of clozapine and L-BAIBA on tripartite synaptic transmission, including GABA<sub>B</sub>-R and the group-III metabotropic glutamate receptor (III-mGluR) using cultured astrocytes, as well as on the thalamocortical hyper-glutamatergic transmission induced by impaired glutamate/NMDA receptors using microdialysis. Clozapine increased astroglial L-BAIBA synthesis in time/concentration-dependent manners. Increased L-BAIBA synthesis was observed until 3 days after clozapine discontinuation. Clozapine did not directly bind III-mGluR or GABA<sub>B</sub>-R, whereas L-BAIBA activated these receptors in the astrocytes. Local administration of MK801 into the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) increased L-glutamate release in the medial frontal cortex (mPFC) (MK801-evoked L-glutamate release). Local administration of L-BAIBA into the mPFC suppressed MK801-evoked L-glutamate release. These actions of L-BAIBA were inhibited by antagonists of III-mGluR and GABA<sub>B</sub>-R, similar to clozapine. These in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that increased frontal L-BAIBA signaling likely plays an important role in the pharmacological actions of clozapine, such as improving the effectiveness of treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia and several clozapine discontinuation syndromes via the activation of III-mGluR and GABA<sub>B</sub>-R in the mPFC.",2023
Multiomics Analyses Reveal Microbiome-Gut-Brain Crosstalk Centered on Aberrant Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid and Tryptophan Metabolism in Drug-Naïve Patients with First-Episode Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is associated with complex crosstalk between the gut microbiota and host metabolism, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Investigating the aberrant neurotransmitter processes reflected by alterations identified using multiomics analysis is valuable to fully explain the pathogenesis of SCZ. We conducted an integrative analysis of multiomics data, including the serum metabolome, fecal metagenome, single nucleotide polymorphism data, and neuroimaging data obtained from a cohort of 127 drug-naïve, first-episode SCZ patients and 92 healthy controls to characterize the microbiome-gut-brain axis in SCZ patients. We used pathway-based polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to determine the biological pathways contributing to genetic risk and mediation effect analyses to determine the important neuroimaging features. Additionally, a random forest model was generated for effective SCZ diagnosis. We found that the altered metabolome and dysregulated microbiome were associated with neuroactive metabolites, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tryptophan, and short-chain fatty acids. Further structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses highlighted that gray matter volume and functional connectivity disturbances mediate the relationships between Ruminococcus_torgues and Collinsella_aerofaciens and symptom severity and the relationships between species Lactobacillus_ruminis and differential metabolites l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid and N-acetylserotonin and cognitive function. Moreover, analyses of the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) support that alterations in GABA and tryptophan neurotransmitter pathways are associated with SCZ risk, and GABA might be a more dominant contributor. This study provides new insights into systematic relationships among genes, metabolism, and the gut microbiota that affect brain functional connectivity, thereby affecting SCZ pathogenesis.",2024
Insulin effects on core neurotransmitter pathways involved in schizophrenia neurobiology: a meta-analysis of preclinical studies. Implications for the treatment.,"Impairment of insulin action and metabolic dysregulation have traditionally been associated with schizophrenia, although the molecular basis of such association remains still elusive. The present meta-analysis aims to assess the impact of insulin action manipulations (i.e., hyperinsulinemia, hypoinsulinemia, systemic or brain insulin resistance) on glutamatergic, dopaminergic, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, and serotonergic pathways in the central nervous system. More than one hundred outcomes, including transcript or protein levels, kinetic parameters, and other components of the neurotransmitter pathways, were collected from cultured cells, animals, or humans, and meta-analyzed by applying a random-effects model and adopting Hedges'g to compare means. Two hundred fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 180 entered the quantitative synthesis. Significant impairments in key regulators of synaptic plasticity processes were detected as the result of insulin handlings. Specifically, protein levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits including type 2A (NR2A) (Hedges' g = -0.95, 95%C.I. = -1.50, -0.39; p = 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 47.46%) and 2B (NR2B) (Hedges'g = -0.69, 95%C.I. = -1.35, -0.02; p = 0.043; I<sup>2</sup> = 62.09%), and Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) (Hedges'g = -0.91, 95%C.I. = -1.51, -0.32; p = 0.003; I<sup>2</sup> = 77.81%) were found reduced in insulin-resistant animal models. Moreover, insulin-resistant animals showed significantly impaired dopamine transporter activity, whereas the dopamine D2 receptor mRNA expression (Hedges'g = 3.259; 95%C.I. = 0.497, 6.020; p = 0.021; I<sup>2</sup> = 90.61%) increased under insulin deficiency conditions. Insulin action modulated glutamate and GABA release, as well as several enzymes involved in GABA and serotonin synthesis. These results suggest that brain neurotransmitter systems are susceptible to insulin signaling abnormalities, resembling the discrete psychotic disorders' neurobiology and possibly contributing to the development of neurobiological hallmarks of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",2023
Localization and Diagnostic Specificity of Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Transcript Alterations in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Schizophrenia.,"Working memory (WM) deficits in schizophrenia are thought to reflect altered inhibition in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This interpretation is supported by findings of lower transcript levels of the 2 enzymes, GAD67 and GAD65, which mediate basal and activity-dependent GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthesis, respectively. However, the relative magnitude, location within the depth of the DLPFC, and specificity to the disease process of schizophrenia of alterations in GAD67 and/or GAD65 remain unclear. Levels of GAD67 and GAD65 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in superficial (layers 2/superficial 3) and deep (deep layer 6/white matter) zones of the DLPFC were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in subjects with schizophrenia (n = 41), major depression (n = 42), or bipolar disorder (n = 39) and unaffected comparison (n = 43) subjects. Relative to the unaffected comparison group, GAD67 and GAD65 mRNA levels in the schizophrenia group were lower (p = .039, effect size = -0.69 and p = .027, effect size = -0.72, respectively) in the superficial zone but were unaltered in the deep zone. In the major depression group, only GAD67 mRNA levels were lower and only in the superficial zone (p = .089, effect size = 0.70). No differences were detected in the bipolar disorder group. Neither GAD67 nor GAD65 mRNA alterations were explained by psychosis, mood disturbance, or common comorbid factors. Alterations in markers of GABA synthesis demonstrated transcript, DLPFC zone, and diagnostic specificity. Given the dependence of WM on GABA neurotransmission in the superficial DLPFC, our findings suggest that limitations to GABA synthesis in this location contribute to WM impairments in schizophrenia, especially during demanding WM tasks, when GABA synthesis requires the activity of both GAD67 and GAD65.",2023
Laminar-Specific Alterations in Calbindin-Positive Boutons in the Prefrontal Cortex of Subjects With Schizophrenia.,"Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with altered GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). GABA neurotransmission requires GABA synthesis by 2 isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) and packaging by the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT). Current postmortem findings suggest that GAD67 messenger RNA is lower in a subset of the calbindin-expressing (CB+) class of GABA neurons in schizophrenia. Hence, we assessed if CB+ GABA neuron boutons are affected in schizophrenia. For 20 matched pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and unaffected comparison subjects, PFC tissue sections were immunolabeled for vGAT, CB, GAD67, and GAD65. The density of CB+ GABA boutons and levels of the 4 proteins per bouton were quantified. Some CB+ GABA boutons contained both GAD65 and GAD67 (GAD65+/GAD67+), whereas others contained only GAD65 (GAD65+) or GAD67 (GAD67+). In schizophrenia, vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+/GAD67+ bouton density was not altered, vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+ bouton density was 86% higher in layers 2/superficial 3 (L2/3s), and vGAT+/CB+/GAD67+ bouton density was 36% lower in L5-6. Bouton GAD levels were differentially altered across bouton types and layers. In schizophrenia, the sum of GAD65 and GAD67 levels in vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+/GAD67+ boutons was 36% lower in L6, GAD65 levels were 51% higher in vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+ boutons in L2, and GAD67 levels in vGAT+/CB+/GAD67+ boutons were 30% to 46% lower in L2/3s-6. These findings indicate that schizophrenia-associated alterations in the strength of inhibition from CB+ GABA neurons in the PFC differ across cortical layers and bouton classes, suggesting complex contributions to PFC dysfunction and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.",2023

Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Glutamate/Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Alterations in Clinical High Risk and First-Episode Schizophrenia: A Preliminary 7-T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging Study.,"Converging lines of evidence suggest that an imbalance between excitation and inhibition is present in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of schizophrenia (SCZ). Gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) and, to a lesser extent, glutamate (Glu) abnormalities were reported in the DLPFC of SCZ patients, especially on the right hemisphere, by post-mortem studies. However, in vivo evidence of GABA, Glu, and Glu/GABA DLPFC abnormalities, particularly on the right side and the early stages of illness, is limited. In this preliminary study, we utilized 7-Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to investigate bilateral Glu/Creatine (Cre), GABA/Cre, and Glu/GABA in the DLPFC of sixteen first episode schizophrenia (FES), seventeen clinical high risk (CHR), and twenty-six healthy comparison (HC) subjects. FES and CHR had abnormal GABA/Cre and Glu/GABA in the right DLPFC (rDLPFC) compared with HC participants, while no differences were observed in the left DLPFC (lDLPFC) among the three groups. Furthermore, HC had higher Glu/GABA in rDLPFC compared to lDLPFC (R > L), whereas the opposite relationship (R < L) was observed in the DLPFC Glu/GABA of FES patients. Altogether, these findings indicate that GABA/Cre and Glu/GABA DLPFC alterations are present before illness manifestation and worsen in FES patients, thus representing a putative early pathophysiological biomarker for SCZ and related psychotic disorders.",2022
Neurofunctional correlates of glutamate and GABA imbalance in psychosis: A systematic review.,"Glutamatergic and GABAergic dysfunction are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous work has shown relationships between glutamate, GABA, and brain activity in healthy volunteers. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether these relationships are disrupted in psychosis. Primary outcomes were the relationship between metabolite levels and fMRI BOLD response in psychosis relative to healthy volunteers. 17 case-control studies met inclusion criteria (594 patients and 538 healthy volunteers). Replicated findings included that in psychosis, positive associations between ACC glutamate levels and brain activity are reduced during resting state conditions and increased during cognitive control tasks, and negative relationships between GABA and local activation in the ACC are reduced. There was evidence that antipsychotic medication may alter the relationship between glutamate levels and brain activity. Emerging literature is providing insights into disrupted relationships between neurometabolites and brain activity in psychosis. Future studies determining a link to clinical variables may develop this approach for biomarker applications, including development or targeting novel therapeutics.",2023
Comprehensive metabolomic characterization of the hippocampus in a ketamine mouse model of schizophrenia.,"Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. However, the detailed metabolic profile changes in the progression of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms are still not fully elucidated. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based untargeted hippocampus high-throughput metabolomics method was first performed to screen for potential biomarkers in a schizophrenia-like state in a chronically administered ketamine-induced mouse model. Our results identified that the amino acid and energy metabolism pathways were significantly affected in mouse models of ketamine-induced schizophrenia. The detailed amino acid profiles were subsequently quantified in the hippocampus. The results showed that ketamine dramatically decreased the Lys, Gly, and Ser levels while significantly increasing the Gln level and relative Glu-to-GABA ratio. Our study suggested that Gln, Gly and Ser metabolism disturbances might be involved in ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes. This research offers a fresh viewpoint for creating new neuroleptic medications and contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying ketamine-induced schizophrenia.",2022
Interactions between dopamine transporter and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-related amino acids on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.,"Cognitive impairments, the main determinants of functional outcomes in schizophrenia, had limited treatment responses and need a better understanding of the mechanisms. Dysfunctions of the dopamine system and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the primary pathophysiologies of schizophrenia, may impair cognition. This study explored the effects and interactions of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and plasma NMDAR-related amino acids on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. We recruited 36 schizophrenia patients and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent cognitive assessments of attention, memory, and executive function. Single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT and ultra-performance liquid chromatography were applied to determine DAT availability and plasma concentrations of eight amino acids, respectively. Compared with HC, schizophrenia patients had lower cognitive performance, higher methionine concentrations, decreased concentrations of glutamic acid, cysteine, aspartic acid, arginine, the ratio of glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glu/GABA), and DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen. Regarding memory scores, Glu/GABA and the DAT availability in left CN and putamen exhibited positive relationships, while methionine concentrations showed negative associations in all participants. The DAT availability in left CN mediated the methionine-memory relationship. An exploratory backward stepwise regression analysis for the four biological markers associated with memory indicated that DAT availability in left CN and Glu/GABA remained in the final model. This study demonstrated the interactions of striatal DAT and NMDAR-related amino acids on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Future studies to comprehensively evaluate their complex interactions and treatment implications are warranted.",2022
"Correlation of Proline, Kynurenic Acid and Glutamate Levels with Cognitive Function: Insights from Digit Span, TMT and RAVLT in Schizophrenia.","&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental disorder which are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, catatonic behavior, negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms. Several gene polymorphisms and neurotransmitters have been linked to schizophrenia. This study assessed the correlation between proline level, Kynurenic Acid (KYNA) and glutamate level with cognitive function among schizophrenia patients, contributing to understanding biochemical factors associated with cognitive impairments. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The research was a cross-sectional observational analytic study of 99 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was diagnosed by SCID-1 questionnaire and the patient's blood was taken to be analyzed in the Biochemical Laboratory of Medical Faculty Andalas University using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to characterize kynurenic acid level, glutamate level and proline level. Data were analyzed using Spearman Correlation in SPSS 25.0, with significance at p<0.05. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; There were 99 schizophrenia patients; most of them were male (62.6%), age median 37 years old and not married (50.5%). The Microproline Level median among participants was 2.64 μg/mL, the median KYNA level was 14.6 nmol/L and the glutamate level was 10.5 μg/mL. Cognitive function was assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Digit Span Test and Trail Making Test (TMT) with a score median of 4/5/5/5 (Trial 1/2/3/Recall), 6/2 (forward/backward), 68/37 sec (TMT A/B), respectively. Spearman Correlation showed that microproline has a negative correlation with RAVLT Trial 1 (r = -0.221, p = 0.014), Digit Span Backward (r = -0.181, p = 0.036), TMT A (r = 0.204, p = 0.021) and TMT B (r = 0.185, p = 0.034). In contrast, other neurotransmitters do not correlate with any cognitive tests. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Proline may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.",2025
Glutamate-Based Therapeutic Strategies for Schizophrenia: Emerging Approaches Beyond Dopamine.,"Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder composed of primary cluster-positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganization, neurocognitive deficits, and social cognitive impairments. While traditional antipsychotics primarily target dopamine pathways, they provide limited efficacy against cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Growing evidence implicates glutamatergic dysregulation, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) hypofunction, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, making glutamate modulation a promising therapeutic approach. This review explores emerging glutamate-based treatment strategies, including NMDA receptor modulators, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agents, glutamate transporter regulators, and kynurenine pathway inhibitors. We summarize preclinical and clinical findings on NMDA co-agonists (D-serine and glycine), glycine transporter inhibitors, D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors, and mGluR-targeted therapies, highlighting their mechanisms, efficacy, and limitations. In addition, we discuss novel interventions aimed at restoring glutamate homeostasis, including neuroinflammatory modulation and synaptic plasticity enhancers. Despite promising results, many glutamate-targeting therapies have yielded inconsistent clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and optimized treatment protocols. We propose that integrating glutamate modulators with existing antipsychotic regimens may enhance therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Future research should focus on refining glutamate-based interventions, identifying predictive biomarkers, and addressing the heterogeneity in schizophrenia pathology. With continued advancements, glutamate modulation has the potential to transform schizophrenia treatment, particularly for cognitive and negative symptoms that remain largely unaddressed by current therapies.",2025
Spatially resolved mapping of cells associated with human complex traits.,"Depicting spatial distributions of disease-relevant cells is crucial for understanding disease pathology<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes. Our study provides a method for spatially resolved mapping of trait-associated cells and demonstrates the gain of biological insights (such as the spatial distribution of trait-relevant cells and related signature genes) through these maps.",2025
The Relationship of glutamate signaling to cannabis use and schizophrenia.,"This review examines the literature associating cannabis with schizophrenia, glutamate dysregulation in schizophrenia, and cannabis involvement in glutamate pathways. Cannabis use is widespread among adolescents world-wide and is sold legally in many countries for recreational use in a variety of forms. Most people use it without lasting effects, but a portion of individuals have negative reactions that manifest in acute psychotic symptoms, and in some, symptoms continue even after the use of cannabis has ceased. To date, there is a huge gap in our understanding of why this occurs. Recent studies have focused on abnormalities in the glutamate pathway in schizophrenia, the effect of cannabis on the glutamate system, and the role of glutamate in the brain Default Mode Network. Given these observations, we hypothesize that perturbance of glutamate neuronal connectivity by cannabis in the brains of individuals genetically at high risk for psychosis will initiate a schizophrenia-like psychosis. Future studies may tie together these diverse observations by combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the default resting state network in patients with new onset schizophrenia who do and do not use cannabis compared with nonpsychotic individuals who do and do not use cannabis.",2025
The relationship between cortical synaptic terminal density marker SV2A and glutamate early in the course of schizophrenia: a multimodal PET and MRS imaging study.,"Loss of glutamatergic terminals is hypothesised to contribute to excitation-inhibition imbalance in schizophrenia, supported by evidence that the normal positive association between glutamate concentrations and synaptic terminal density is not found in patients with chronic schizophrenia. However, it is unknown whether the relationship between synaptic terminal density and glutamate levels is altered early in the course of illness. To address this, we investigated [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J distribution volume ratio (DVR) and glutamatergic markers in healthy volunteers (HV) and in antipsychotic-naïve/free patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) recruited from first-episode psychosis services. Forty volunteers (HV n = 19, SCZ n = 21) underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J positron emission tomography and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) imaging in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left hippocampus to index [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J DVR and creatine-scaled glutamate (Glu/Cr) and glutamate in combination with glutamine (Glx/Cr). In the HV but not SCZ group, [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J DVR was significantly positively associated with Glu/Cr (Spearman's rho = 0.55, p = 0.02) and Glx/Cr (Spearman's rho = 0.73, p = 0.0004) in the ACC, and with Glu/Cr in the left hippocampus (Spearman's rho = 0.77, p = 0.0001). DVR was significantly lower in the ACC in the SCZ group compared to the HV group (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z = 1.44, p = 0.03). Together, these findings indicate that the normal relationship between levels of a synaptic terminal density marker and levels of glutamate is disrupted early in the course of schizophrenia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that there is loss of glutamatergic terminals at illness onset.",2025
Impact of neuroinflammation on brain glutamate and dopamine signalling in schizophrenia: an update.,"Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Over the years, numerous treatment options have been introduced for schizophrenia. Although they are relatively successful in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, most of the current treatments have a negligible effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms. Thus, none of them could prevent the relapse of psychotic episodes. Among the numerous hypotheses explaining the development and progression of schizophrenia, the cytokine hypothesis explains the role of inflammatory markers as a significant culprit in the development of schizophrenia. Elevated cytokines are reported in animal models and schizophrenic patients. The cytokine hypothesis is based on how increased inflammatory markers can cause changes in the dopaminergic, glutamate, and tryptophan metabolism pathways, like that observed in schizophrenic patients. Reasons, such as autoimmune disease, maternal immune activation, infection, etc., can pave the way for the development of schizophrenia and are associated with the negative, positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is a need to focus on the significance of anti-inflammatory drugs against these symptoms. The development of new treatment strategies in the management of schizophrenia can provide better therapeutic outcomes in terms of the severity of symptoms and treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia. This review attempts to explain the association between elevated inflammatory markers and various neurotransmitters, and the possible use of medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, statins, and estrogens as adjuvant therapy. Over the years, these hypotheses have been the basis for drug discovery for the treatment of schizophrenia.",2025
Dysbindin-1 Mutation Alters Prefrontal Cortex Extracellular Glutamate and Dopamine In Vivo.,"Elevated risk for schizophrenia is associated with a variation in the <i>DTNBP1</i> gene encoding dysbindin-1, which may underpin cognitive impairments in this prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve anomalies in glutamate and dopamine signaling, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Indeed, mice with <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations exhibit spatial and working memory deficits that are associated with deficits in glutamate release and NMDA receptor function as determined by slice electrophysiology. The present study extended the results from ex vivo approaches by examining how the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation impacts high K+- and NMDA receptor-evoked glutamate release within the PFC using in vivo microdialysis procedures. <i>Dntbp1</i> mutant mice are also reported to exhibit blunted K+-evoked dopamine release within the PFC. Thus, we examined also K+- and NMDA-evoked dopamine release within this region. Perfusion of high-concentration K+ or NMDA solutions increased the PFC levels of both dopamine and glutamate in wild-type (WT) but not in <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutants (MUT), whereas mice heterozygous for the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation (HET) exhibited blunted K+-evoked dopamine release. No net-flux microdialysis procedures confirmed elevated basal extracellular content of both glutamate and dopamine within the PFC of HET and MUT mice. These in vivo microdialysis results corroborate prior indications that <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations perturb evoked dopamine and glutamate release within the PFC, provide in vivo evidence for impaired NMDA receptor function within the PFC, and suggest that these neurochemical anomalies may be related to abnormally elevated basal neurotransmitter content.",2024
Identification and Correlation Analysis of Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Three Brain Regions of Patients with Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder that is marked by hallucinations and cognitive impairments. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that is associated with iron and lipid peroxidation; it may play a role in SZ etiology. The present study aimed to explore the correlations between ferroptosis-related genes and SZ in three brain regions. We used the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE80655 to analyze brain samples from SZ patients and controls; specifically, we evaluated the anterior cingulate cortex (Ancg), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and nucleus accumbens (nAcc). The data were preprocessed in R, and ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Pearson correlation analysis was then performed to assess correlations between these DEGs and age at death, postmortem interval, or brain pH. To identify important ferroptosis-related genes, we created a protein-protein interaction network using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and visualized it using Cytoscape software. Moreover, the pROC package was used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for these important genes. Finally, gene set variation analysis was used for the pathway enrichment analysis of ferroptosis-related pathways, followed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Nine ferroptosis-related DEGs were upregulated in the Ancg region and one was downregulated in the nAcc region. In the Ancg region, the SZ group had four ferroptosis-related DEGs that were negatively correlated with postmortem interval, and the control group had five ferroptosis-related DEGs that were negatively correlated with brain pH. The protein-protein interaction network analysis of the Ancg region revealed seven significant interacting genes; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and galectin 3 (LGALS3) were the hub genes. Gene set variation analysis revealed substantial changes in the glycolysis pathway in the Ancg region, and in the glutamate transmembrane transport pathway and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis process pathway in the nAcc region, in SZ patients compared with controls. The correlation between ferroptosis and SZ appears to be stronger in the Ancg than in the nAcc or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This association may be mediated by TIMP1 and LGALS3 as well as by the glycolysis pathway, indicating that these might be possible biomarkers for SZ.",2024
Glutamate concentrations and cognitive deficits in ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia: An exploratory and comparative <sup>1</sup>H-MRS study.,"Glutamate plays a crucial role in cognition, learning, and mood regulation, with studies suggesting glutamatergic dysfunction in chronic schizophrenia. This study explored glutamate levels in the occipital cortex (OCC) and cognitive function in ultra-treatment resistant schizophrenia (uTRS) compared to healthy controls. Fifteen uTRS participants and 19 healthy controls underwent 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to measure glutamate levels in the OCC. Cognitive performance was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). No significant differences in OCC glutamate levels were found between uTRS participants and healthy controls. uTRS participants performed significantly worse on the MCCB compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size (η² = 0.72). Although no significant direct relationships were observed between Glu levels and cognitive performance, significant regression models for certain cognitive domains suggest a modest association between Glu levels and cognitive outcomes. Participants with uTRS exhibited significant cognitive deficits compared to healthy controls, though no significant differences in OCC Glu levels were found. While no clear linear or quadratic relationships emerged, Glu explained a small portion of the variance in cognitive performance, indicating a more complex role for Glu in cognition that warrants further investigation.",2025
Intranasal Insulin Increases Brain Glutathione and Enhances Antioxidant Capacity in Healthy Participants but Not in Those With Early Psychotic Disorders.,"We examined the acute effects of intranasal insulin on cognitive function and brain glutathione (GSH), a central factor in resistance to oxidative stress, in both participants with early psychosis and healthy control (HC) participants. Twenty-one patients with early-stage psychotic disorders and 18 HC participants underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans and cognitive assessments before and after administration of intranasal insulin 40 IU. We conducted proton MRS (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) in the prefrontal cortex at 4T to measure GSH and glutamate metabolites. We assessed cognition using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia symbol coding, digit sequencing, and verbal fluency tasks, in addition to the Stroop task. The mean (SD) age of participants was 25.7 (4.6) years; 51.3% were female. There were no significant group differences at baseline in age, sex, body mass index, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), or cognition. Patients had higher baseline GSH (p < .001) and glutamate (p = .007). After insulin administration, GSH increased in HC participants (mean change, 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.26; p = .015), but not in patients. Symbol coding improved in both patients (0.74; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.11; p < .001) and HC participants (0.83; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.09; p < .001), and verbal fluency improved in HC participants (0.43; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72; p = .006). Lower baseline HOMA-IR was associated with greater change in GSH (coefficient -0.22; 95% CI -0.40 to -0.04; p = .017). Intranasal insulin increased brain GSH in HC participants, but not in patients with early psychotic disorders. These novel findings demonstrate that intranasal insulin enhances antioxidant capacity and resilience to oxidative stress in HC individuals in contrast to an absent antioxidant response in those with early psychotic disorders.",2025
"Glutamate, GABA and NAA in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: A systematic review of the effect of clozapine and group differences between clozapine-responders and non-responders.","Treatment-resistance in patients with schizophrenia is a major obstacle for improving outcome in patients, especially in those not gaining from clozapine. Novel research implies that glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities may be present in treatment-resistant patients, and preclinical research suggests that clozapine affects the GABAergic system. Moreover, clozapine may have a neuroprotective role. To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relationship between clozapine and in vivo measures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (glu), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) brain levels in treatment- and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (TRS and UTRS). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we included three longitudinal and six cross sectional studies utilizing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) that explored brain metabolite levels in clozapine-treated patients. Findings were limited by a small number of studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn, but the present studies may imply that clozapine reduces glutamate levels in striatal but not cortical areas, whereas glutamatergic metabolites and GABA levels may be increased in ACC in the combined group of TRS and UTRS. Clozapine may also increase NAA in cortical areas. Importantly, this review highlights the need for further clinical studies investigating the effect of clozapine on brain levels of glutamate, GABA, and NAA as well as metabolite group differences in patients with UTRS compared with TRS.",2025
Glutamate levels and symptom burden in high-risk and first-episode schizophrenia: a dual-voxel study of the anterior cingulate cortex.,"Reduced glutamatergic excitability of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been long suspected in schizophrenia; recent observations support low glutamatergic tone as the primary pathophysiology contributing to subtle early features of this illness, with a secondary disinhibition (higher glutamate tone) resulting in more prominent clinical symptoms later in its course. We sought to investigate whether people with genetic high risk (GHR) for schizophrenia have lower glutamate levels in the ACC than those at later stages of clinical high risk (CHR) and those with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), among whom symptoms are already prominent. We recruited people with CHR, GHR, or FES, as well as healthy controls. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined glutamate levels in the perigenual ACC (pACC) and dorsal ACC (dACC) using a 3 T scanner. We recruited 302 people across multiple stages of psychosis, including 63 with CHR, 76 with GHR, and 96 with FES, as well as 67 healthy controls. Those with GHR had lower glutamate levels in the dACC than those with CHR, while those with CHR had higher glutamate levels in the pACC than those with FES. Higher disorganization, but not any other symptom domain, was associated with lower levels of glutamate in the GHR group (dACC and pACC) and in the CHR group (pACC). The cross-sectional design precluded inferences regarding individual clinical trajectory and resolution at 3 T was insufficient to separate spectra of glutamine from glutamate. Reduced glutamatergic tone among people genetically predisposed to schizophrenia supports diminished excitability as an early feature of schizophrenia, contributing to the subtle symptom of disorganization across high-risk states. Higher glutamate levels become apparent when psychotic symptoms become prominent, possibly as a disinhibitory effect and, at the full-blown stage of psychosis, the relationship between glutamate concentrations and symptoms ceases to be simply linear.",2024
Mechanisms of glutamate receptors hypofunction dependent synaptic transmission impairment in the hippocampus of schizophrenia susceptibility gene Opcml-deficient mouse model.,"Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with high heritability, characterized by positive and negative symptoms as well as cognitive abnormalities. Dysfunction in glutamate synapse is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the precise role of the perturbed glutamatergic system in contributing to the cognitive abnormalities of schizophrenia at the synaptic level remains largely unknown. Although our previous work found that Opcml promotes spine maturation and Opcml-deficient mice exhibit schizophrenia-related cognitive impairments, the synaptic mechanism remains unclear. By using whole-cell patch clamp recording, we found that decreased neuronal excitability and alterations in intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 PNs in Opcml-deficient mice. Furthermore, Opcml deficiency leads to impaired glutamatergic transmission in hippocampus, which is closely related to postsynaptic AMPA/NMDA receptors dysfunction, resulting in the disturbances of E/I balance. Additionally, we found that the aripiprazole which we used to ameliorate abnormal cognitive behaviors also rescued the impaired glutamatergic transmission in Opcml-deficient mice. These findings will help to understand the synaptic mechanism in schizophrenia pathogenesis, providing insights into schizophrenia therapeutics with glutamatergic disruption.",2024
Dysfunction of the NMDA Receptor in the Pathophysiology of Schizophrenia and/or the Pathomechanisms of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia.,"For several decades, the dopamine hypothesis contributed to the discovery of numerous typical and atypical antipsychotics and was the sole hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, neither typical nor atypical antipsychotics, other than clozapine, have been effective in addressing negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, which are indices for the prognostic and disability outcomes of schizophrenia. Following the development of atypical antipsychotics, the therapeutic targets for antipsychotics expanded beyond the blockade of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors to explore the partial agonism of the D2 receptor and the modulation of new targets, such as D3, 5-HT1A, 5-HT7, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Despite these efforts, to date, psychiatry has not successfully developed antipsychotics with antipsychotic properties proven to be superior to those of clozapine. The glutamate hypothesis, another hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology/pathomechanism of schizophrenia, was proposed based on clinical findings that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, induce schizophrenia-like psychotic episodes. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) revealed that approximately 30% of the risk genes for schizophrenia (the total number was over one hundred) encode proteins associated with glutamatergic transmission. These findings supported the validation of the glutamate hypothesis, which was inspired by the clinical findings regarding NMDAR antagonists. Additionally, these clinical and genetic findings suggest that schizophrenia is possibly a syndrome with complicated pathomechanisms that are affected by multiple biological and genetic vulnerabilities. The glutamate hypothesis has been the most extensively investigated pathophysiology/pathomechanism hypothesis, other than the dopamine hypothesis. Studies have revealed the possibility that functional abnormalities of the NMDAR play important roles in the pathophysiology/pathomechanism of schizophrenia. However, no antipsychotics derived from the glutamatergic hypothesis have yet been approved for the treatment of schizophrenia or treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Considering the increasing evidence supporting the potential pro-cognitive effects of glutamatergic agents and the lack of sufficient medications to treat the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia, these previous setbacks cannot preclude research into potential novel glutamate modulators. Given this background, to emphasize the importance of the dysfunction of the NMDAR in the pathomechanism and/or pathophysiology of schizophrenia, this review introduces the increasing findings on the functional abnormalities in glutamatergic transmission associated with the NMDAR.",2024
MicroRNA dysregulation in glutamate and dopamine pathways of schizophrenia: From molecular pathways to diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.,"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder, and genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in its development. Dysregulated glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission pathways are involved in schizophrenia development. Besides genetic mutations, epigenetic dysregulation has a considerable role in dysregulating molecular pathways involved in schizophrenia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that target specific mRNAs and inhibit their translation into proteins. As epigenetic factors, miRNAs regulate many genes involved in glutamate and dopamine signaling pathways; thereby, their dysregulation can contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Secretion of specific miRNAs from damaged cells into body fluids can make them one of the ideal non-invasive biomarkers in the early diagnosis of schizophrenia. Also, understanding the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in schizophrenia pathogenesis can pave the way for developing novel treatments for patients with schizophrenia. In this study, we reviewed the glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathophysiology and highlighted the role of miRNA dysregulation in schizophrenia development. Besides, we shed light on the significance of circulating miRNAs for schizophrenia diagnosis and the recent findings on the miRNA-based treatment for schizophrenia.",2024
Schizophrenia-Like Deficits and Impaired Glutamate/Gamma-aminobutyric acid Homeostasis in Zfp804a Conditional Knockout Mice.,"Zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) was the first genome-wide associated susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (SCZ) and played an essential role in the pathophysiology of SCZ by influencing neurodevelopment regulation, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and RNA translational control; however, the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. A nervous-system-specific Zfp804a (ZNF804A murine gene) conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 technology and the Cre/loxP method. Multiple and complex SCZ-like behaviors, such as anxiety, depression, and impaired cognition, were observed in Zfp804a cKO mice. Molecular biological methods and targeted metabolomics assay validated that Zfp804a cKO mice displayed altered SATB2 (a cortical superficial neuron marker) expression in the cortex; aberrant NeuN, cleaved caspase 3, and DLG4 (markers of mature neurons, apoptosis, and postsynapse, respectively) expressions in the hippocampus and a loss of glutamate (Glu)/γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) homeostasis with abnormal GAD67 (Gad1) expression in the hippocampus. Clozapine partly ameliorated some SCZ-like behaviors, reversed the disequilibrium of the Glu/GABA ratio, and recovered the expression of GAD67 in cKO mice. Zfp804a cKO mice reproducing SCZ-like pathological and behavioral phenotypes were successfully developed. A novel mechanism was determined in which Zfp804a caused Glu/GABA imbalance and reduced GAD67 expression, which was partly recovered by clozapine treatment. These findings underscore the role of altered gene expression in understanding the pathogenesis of SCZ and provide a reliable SCZ model for future therapeutic interventions and biomarker discovery.",2024
Passing the torch: The ascendance of the glutamatergic synapse in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.,"For nearly fifty years, the dopamine hypothesis has dominated our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and provided the lone target for drug development. However, with the exception of clozapine, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonizing anti-psychotic drugs have little impact on the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, aspects of the disorder that robustly predict outcome. Pathologic studies reveal cortical atrophy and wide-spread loss of glutamatergic synaptic spines, unexplained by dopaminergic malfunction. Recent genome-wide association studies indicate that at least thirty risk genes for schizophrenia encode proteins localized to the glutamatergic synapse and inhibit glutamate neurotransmission, especially at the NMDA receptor. To function, the NMDA receptor requires the binding of glycine (primarily in the cerebellum and brainstem) or D-serine (in forebrain) to the NR1 channel subunit of the NMDA receptor. Genetically silencing the gene (srr) encoding serine racemase, the biosynthetic enzyme for D-serine, results in forebrain NMDA receptor hypofunction. The srr-/- mice have 90 % loss of endogenous D-serine and approximately 70 % decrease in NMDA receptor function. Several animal models of schizophrenia are based on behavioral and pharmacologic strategies, which have negligible validity with regard to the fundamental etiology of schizophrenia. We summarize here the results of a mouse model, in which srr, one of the two dozen or more risk gene for schizophrenia that affect NMDA receptor function, has been inactivated. The srr-/- mice exhibit striking similarities to schizophrenia including cortical atrophy, loss of cortico-limbic glutamatergic synapses, increased sub-cortical dopamine release, EEG abnormalities, and cognitive impairments. The limited efficacy of drugs targeting the glutamatergic synapse on DSM-5 diagnosed criteria for schizophrenia used in clinical trials may reflect the fact that only 30 % of the patients have impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission, resulting from the genetic heterogeneity of the disorder.",2024
Neurocognition and NMDAR co-agonists pathways in individuals with treatment resistant first-episode psychosis: a 3-year follow-up longitudinal study.,"This study aims to determine whether 1) individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia display early cognitive impairment compared to treatment-responders and healthy controls and 2) N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor hypofunction is an underlying mechanism of cognitive deficits in treatment-resistance. In this case‒control 3-year-follow-up longitudinal study, n = 697 patients with first-episode psychosis, aged 18 to 35, were screened for Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis criteria through an algorithm that assigns patients to responder, limited-response or treatment-resistant category (respectively resistant to 0, 1 or 2 antipsychotics). Assessments at baseline: MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery; N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor co-agonists biomarkers in brain by MRS (prefrontal glutamate levels) and plasma (D-serine and glutamate pathways key markers). Patients were compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 114). Results: patient mean age 23, 27% female. Treatment-resistant (n = 51) showed lower scores than responders (n = 183) in processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning and visual learning. Limited responders (n = 59) displayed an intermediary phenotype. Treatment-resistant and limited responders were merged in one group for the subsequent D-serine and glutamate pathway analyses. This group showed D-serine pathway dysregulation, with lower levels of the enzymes serine racemase and serine-hydroxymethyltransferase 1, and higher levels of the glutamate-cysteine transporter 3 than in responders. Better cognition was associated with higher D-serine and lower glutamate-cysteine transporter 3 levels only in responders; this association was disrupted in the treatment resistant group. Treatment resistant patients and limited responders displayed early cognitive and persistent functioning impairment. The dysregulation of NMDAR co-agonist pathways provides underlying molecular mechanisms for cognitive deficits in treatment-resistant first-episode psychosis. If replicated, our findings would open ways to mechanistic biomarkers guiding response-based patient stratification and targeting cognitive improvement in clinical trials.",2024
Dysregulated Transcript Expression but Not Function of the Glutamate Transporter EAAT2 in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a serious mental illness with complex pathology, including abnormalities in the glutamate system. Glutamate is rapidly removed from the synapse by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Changes in the expression and localization of the primary glutamate transporter EAAT2 are found in the brain in central nervous system (CNS) disorders including SCZ. We hypothesize that neuronal expression and function of EAAT2 are increased in the frontal cortex in subjects diagnosed with SCZ. EAAT2 protein expression and glutamate transporter function were assayed in synaptosome preparations from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ subjects and age- and sex-matched nonpsychiatrically ill controls. EAAT2 splice variant transcript expression was assayed in enriched populations of neurons and astrocytes from the DLPFC. Pathway analysis of publicly available transcriptomic datasets was carried out to identify biological changes associated with EAAT2 perturbation in different cell types. We found no significant changes in EAAT2 protein expression or glutamate uptake in the DLPFC in SCZ subjects compared with controls (n = 10/group). Transcript expression of EAAT2 and signaling molecules associated with EAAT2b trafficking (CaMKIIa and DLG1) were significantly altered in enriched populations of astrocytes and pyramidal neurons (P < .05) in SCZ (n = 16/group). These changes were not associated with antipsychotic medications. Pathway analysis also identified cell-type-specific enrichment of biological pathways associated with perturbation of astrocyte (immune pathways) and neuronal (metabolic pathways) EAAT2 expression. Overall, these data support the growing body of evidence for the role of dysregulation of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of SCZ.",2025
Glutamatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies across schizophrenia spectrum disorders.,"Studies using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal substantial inconsistencies in the levels of brain glutamate, glutamine and glutamate + glutamine across schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This systematic review employs qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse the patterns and relationships between glutamatergic metabolites, schizophrenia spectrum disorders and brain regions. A literature search was conducted using various databases with keywords including glutamate, glutamine, schizophrenia, psychosis and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Inclusion criteria were limited to case-control studies that reported glutamatergic metabolite levels in adult patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis - i.e. first-episode psychosis, schizophrenia, treatment-resistant schizophrenia and/or ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia - using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T or above. Pooled study data were synthesized and analysed. A total of 92 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 2721 healthy controls and 2822 schizophrenia spectrum disorder participants. Glu levels were higher in the basal ganglia, frontal cortex and medial prefrontal of first-episode psychosis participants, contrasting overall lower levels in schizophrenia participants. For Gln, strong differences in metabolite levels were evident in the basal ganglia, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal cortex, with first-episode psychosis showing significantly higher levels in the basal ganglia. In glutamate + glutamine, higher metabolite levels were found across schizophrenia spectrum disorder groups, particularly in the basal ganglia and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of treatment-resistant schizophrenia participants. Significant relationships were found between metabolite levels and medication status, clinical measures and methodological variables. The review highlights abnormal glutamatergic metabolite levels throughout schizophrenia spectrum disorders and in specific brain regions. The review underscores the importance of standardized future research assessing glutamatergic metabolites using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy due to considerable literature heterogeneity.",2024
Multiple serum anti-glutamate receptor antibody levels in clozapine-treated/naïve patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"Glutamatergic function abnormalities have been implicated in the etiology of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), and the efficacy of clozapine may be attributed to its impact on the glutamate system. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting the involvement of immune processes and increased prevalence of antineuronal antibodies in TRS. This current study aimed to investigate the levels of multiple anti-glutamate receptor antibodies in TRS and explore the effects of clozapine on these antibody levels. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure and compare the levels of anti-glutamate receptor antibodies (NMDAR, AMPAR, mGlur3, mGluR5) in clozapine-treated TRS patients (TRS-C, n = 37), clozapine-naïve TRS patients (TRS-NC, n = 39), and non-TRS patients (nTRS, n = 35). Clinical symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), while cognitive function was evaluated using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The levels of all four glutamate receptor antibodies in TRS-NC were significantly higher than those in nTRS (p < 0.001) and in TRS-C (p < 0.001), and the antibody levels in TRS-C were comparable to those in nTRS. However, no significant associations were observed between antibody levels and symptom severity or cognitive function across all three groups after FDR correction. Our findings suggest that TRS may related to increased anti-glutamate receptor antibody levels and provide further evidence that glutamatergic dysfunction and immune processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of TRS. The impact of clozapine on anti-glutamate receptor antibody levels may be a pharmacological mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects.",2024
Association of neurotransmitter pathway polygenic risk with specific symptom profiles in psychosis.,"A primary goal of psychiatry is to better understand the pathways that link genetic risk to psychiatric symptoms. Here, we tested association of diagnosis and endophenotypes with overall and neurotransmitter pathway-specific polygenic risk in patients with early-stage psychosis. Subjects included 205 demographically diverse cases with a psychotic disorder who underwent comprehensive psychiatric and neurological phenotyping and 115 matched controls. Following genotyping, we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS summary statistics. To test if overall genetic risk can be partitioned into affected neurotransmitter pathways, we calculated pathway PGSs (pPGSs) for SZ risk affecting each of four major neurotransmitter systems: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Psychosis subjects had elevated SZ PGS versus controls; cases with SZ or BP diagnoses had stronger SZ or BP risk, respectively. There was no significant association within psychosis cases between individual symptom measures and overall PGS. However, neurotransmitter-specific pPGSs were moderately associated with specific endophenotypes; notably, glutamate was associated with SZ diagnosis and with deficits in cognitive control during task-based fMRI, while dopamine was associated with global functioning. Finally, unbiased endophenotype-driven clustering identified three diagnostically mixed case groups that separated on primary deficits of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognitive control. All clusters showed strong genome-wide risk. Cluster 2, characterized by deficits in cognitive control and negative symptoms, additionally showed specific risk concentrated in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Due to the intensive characterization of our subjects, the present study was limited to a relatively small cohort. As such, results should be followed up with additional research at the population and mechanism level. Our study suggests pathway-based PGS analysis may be a powerful path forward to study genetic mechanisms driving psychiatric endophenotypes.",2024
Association of Blood Metabolomics Biomarkers with Brain Metabolites and Patient-Reported Outcomes as a New Approach in Individualized Diagnosis of Schizophrenia.,"Given its polygenic nature, there is a need for a personalized approach to schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to select laboratory biomarkers from blood, brain imaging, and clinical assessment, with an emphasis on patients' self-report questionnaires. Metabolomics studies of serum samples from 51 patients and 45 healthy volunteers, based on the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), led to the identification of 3 biochemical indicators (cortisol, glutamate, lactate) of schizophrenia. These metabolites were sequentially correlated with laboratory tests results, imaging results, and clinical assessment outcomes, including patient self-report outcomes. The hierarchical cluster analysis on the principal components (HCPC) was performed to identify the most homogeneous clinical groups. Significant correlations were noted between blood lactates and 11 clinical and 10 neuroimaging parameters. The increase in lactate and cortisol were significantly associated with a decrease in immunological parameters, especially with the level of reactive lymphocytes. The strongest correlations with the level of blood lactate and cortisol were demonstrated by brain glutamate, N-acetylaspartate and the concentrations of glutamate and glutamine, creatine and phosphocreatine in the prefrontal cortex. Metabolomics studies and the search for associations with brain parameters and self-reported outcomes may provide new diagnostic evidence to specific schizophrenia phenotypes.",2024
Endocannabinoid levels in plasma and neurotransmitters in the brain: a preliminary report on patients with a psychotic disorder and healthy individuals.,"Interactions between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and neurotransmitter systems might mediate the risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Consequently, we investigated in patients with SSD and healthy controls (HC) the relations between (1) plasma concentrations of two prototypical endocannabinoids (N-arachidonoylethanolamine [anandamide] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) and (2) striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), and glutamate and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As anandamide and 2-AG might reduce the activity of these neurotransmitters, we hypothesized negative correlations between their plasma levels and the abovementioned neurotransmitters in both groups. Blood samples were obtained from 18 patients and 16 HC to measure anandamide and 2-AG plasma concentrations. For all subjects, we acquired proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans to assess Glx (i.e. glutamate plus glutamine) and GABA + (i.e. GABA plus macromolecules) concentrations in the ACC. Ten patients and 14 HC also underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DOPA positron emission tomography for assessment of striatal DSC. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relations between the outcome measures. A negative association between 2-AG plasma concentration and ACC Glx concentration was found in patients (<i>p</i> = 0.008). We found no evidence of other significant relationships between 2-AG or anandamide plasma concentrations and dopaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic measures in either group. Our preliminary results suggest an association between peripheral 2-AG and ACC Glx levels in patients.",2024
Histamine-3 Receptor Availability and Glutamate Levels in the Brain: A PET-1H-MRS Study of Patients With Schizophrenia and Healthy Controls.,"The histamine-3 receptor (H3R) may have a role in cognitive processes through its action as a presynaptic heteroreceptor inhibiting the release of glutamate in the brain. To explore this, we examined anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum H3R availability in patients with schizophrenia and characterized their relationships with glutamate levels in corresponding brain regions. We employed a cross-sectional study, recruiting 12 patients with schizophrenia and 12 healthy volunteers. Participants underwent positron emission tomography using the H3R-specific radio ligand [11C]MK-8278, followed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutamate levels, recorded as Glu and Glx. Based on existing literature, the ACC and striatum were selected as regions of interest. We found significant inverse relationships between tracer uptake and Glu (r = -0.66, P = .02) and Glx (r = -0.62, P = .04) levels in the ACC of patients, which were absent in healthy volunteers (Glu: r = -0.19, P = .56, Glx: r = 0.10, P = .75). We also found a significant difference in striatal (F1,20 = 6.00, P = .02) and ACC (F1,19 = 4.75, P = .04) Glx levels between groups. These results provide evidence of a regionally specific relationship between H3Rs and glutamate levels, which builds on existing preclinical literature. Our findings add to a growing literature indicating H3Rs may be a promising treatment target in schizophrenia, particularly for cognitive impairment, which has been associated with altered glutamate signaling.",2024
Neuroendocrine characterization into schizophrenia: norepinephrine and melatonin as promising biomarkers.,"Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)has garnered extensive attention as a neuroendocrine marker in schizophrenia (SZ), its clinical utility remains limite due to inconsistent findings. To address this gap, serum samples were collected from 24 female patients with SZ and 25 healthy controls. The metabolic profiling was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to capture abroad range of metabolites. Our results revealed that BDNF is not a robust discriminatory biomarker. Marked differences in metabolic profiles were identified between patients with SZ and healthy individuals. The GC-MS analysis revealed significant differences in 79 metabolites; while the LC-MS analysis identified 419 significantly differential metabolites. Functional analysis reveals that these differential metabolites predominantly contribute to metabolic and neuro-related processes. Our findings demonstrate that norepinephrine and melatonin, two additional neuroendocrine compounds, are significantly elevated in patients with SZ compared to healthy controls. Notably, their higher areas under the curve (AUC) values compared to BDNF highlight their potential as more reliable biomarkers for SZ. This study offers valuable insights into the altered metabolic patterns of female patients with SZ and establishes melatonin and norepinephrine as promising neuroendocrine biomarkers, underscoring their diagnostic value and role in the neuroendocrine regulation of mental disorders.",2025
"Dysregulation of Noradrenergic Activity: Its Role in Conceptualizing and Treating Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia, Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.","When discussing neurotransmitters whose signaling plays an important role in psychiatric illnesses, serotonin and dopamine may be the first that come to mind. Although serotonin and dopamine have significant roles, the impact of norepinephrine signaling is often overlooked. A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperactivity of norepinephrine signaling is an underlying issue in psychiatric disorders; conversely, there is evidence to suggest that deficits in the noradrenergic system are just as significant. Hence, alterations in noradrenergic activity are better characterized as dysregulation rather than a reductive, outdated formulation of ""too much"" or ""too little"" activity. Therefore, symptoms such as agitation, irritability, hyperarousal, and insomnia could be treated by targeting the underlying pathophysiology related to noradrenergic dysregulation with targeted treatments. In a recent consensus panel meeting, 5 experts reviewed the available evidence of altered noradrenergic activity and its potential role in some of the most common psychiatric disorders. This Academic Highlights article summarizes their discussion and presents the panel's conclusions.",2024
Effects of combined postweaning social isolation and ketamine administration on schizophrenia-like behaviour in male Sprague Dawley rats.,"The pathophysiology behind negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia is not well understood, thus limiting the effectiveness of treatment on these symptoms. Developing reliable animal model of schizophrenia is vital to advance our understanding on the neurobiological basis of the disorder. Double hit is used to refer to the use of two schizophrenia inducing interventions viz ketamine exposure and social isolation. In this study we aim to investigate the robustness of double hit model of schizophrenia in inducing negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. On postnatal day (PND) 23, thirty-two male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly grouped into four equal groups as follows: group housed + saline (GH), group housed + ketamine (GHK), isolated + saline (SI), and isolated + ketamine (SIK). A single ketamine dose (16 mg/kg) was administered 3 times a week for four weeks. Isolated animals were housed singly throughout the study. The following behavioural tests were carried out: elevated plus maze, three chamber social interaction, resident intruder tests, and novel object recognition (NOR). The SIK group exhibited high anxiety levels, with increased ACTH, corticosterone and norepinephrine concentration when compared to the other groups. The SIK animals also presented with reduced social interaction and decreased oxytocin concentration. SIK rats were more aggressive towards a juvenile intruder but had low testosterone concentration. The SIK group or double hit model showed impaired visual learning and memory and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This suggest that the double hit model is more robust in inducing negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia than each treatment alone.",2025
Meta-analysis on the efficacy of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors reboxetine and atomoxetine for the treatment of schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Norepinephrine transporter inhibitors that can alter the level of neurotransmitter in the brain are used to treat neurological disorders. However, a number of studies have reported their limited significance as a result of their slow onset of action and moderate efficacy. To determine the effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), reboxetine and atomoxetine on schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Relevant articles published between 2000 and 2022 were searched in the MEDLINE, CINAHL (via Ebsco), Web of Science and Scopus databases. Among the various NRIs, studies concerning the 2 potent drugs - reboxetine and atomoxetine - were selected for analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated, along with the exploration of heterogeneity and publication bias, using RevMan software. A total of 14 eligible studies with a combined sample size of 970 patients were included. Using a random effects model, an OR of 0.55 (0.32-0.94), a Tau2 value of 0.23, a ÷2 value of 12.31, 8 degrees of freedom (df), an I2 of 35%, a Z value of 2.19, and a p-value of 0.03 were recorded for reboxetine. Atomoxetine had an OR of 0.35 (0.13-0.97), a Tau2 value of 0.58, a ÷2 value of 7.31, 4 df, an I2 of 45%, a Z value of 1.53, and a p-value of 0.04. All results were statistically significant with a low risk of publication bias, as was evident from the p-values >0.05 derived from the Egger's test and the Begg's test. These drugs provided comparable changes to control drugs in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and ADHD ratings. This confirms the efficacy of reboxetine for the treatment of schizophrenia and atomoxetine for the treatment of ADHD. The present meta-analysis suggests that NRIs are efficacious and therefore they are potential candidate drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia and ADHD.",2023
Association of working memory and elevated overnight urinary norepinephrine in patients with schizophrenia.,"Norepinephrine has both central and peripheral origins and is known to influence cognitive processes in attention, learning, and working memory, but the research regarding the impact of norepinephrine on cognition in schizophrenia remains sparse, and mainly focuses on centrally regulated noradrenergic effects. This study examined the relationship between cumulative overnight norepinephrine levels in the urine and working memory in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Urinary catecholamines were collected overnight in patients with schizophrenia (n = 75) and healthy controls (n = 33). Working memory was assessed using the digit sequencing task. Patients showed significantly higher average levels of overnight norepinephrine (t(103.10) = -3.16, p = 0.002) and reduced working memory performance (t(90) = 3.87, p = 0.001) compared with healthy individuals. There was a significant negative correlation between norepinephrine and working memory in patients (r = -0.38, p = 0.005), but not in controls (r = 0.08, p = 0.67). After controlling for age, sex, antipsychotic medications, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor-based antidepressants, the correlation remained significant (r = -0.41, p = 0.004). High peripheral overnight levels of urinary norepinephrine are associated with lower working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia. These results parallel previous studies suggesting that high levels of central norepinephrine may result in working memory impairments. As norepinephrine rapidly breaks down and usually does not pass through the blood-brain barrier, the potential effect of peripheral cumulative norepinephrine on working memory is intriguing, and needs to be further investigated.",2021
The role of norepinephrine in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.,"Several lines of evidence have suggested for decades a role for norepinephrine (NE) in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. Recent experimental findings reveal anatomical and physiological properties of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system and its involvement in brain function and cognition. Here, we integrate these two lines of evidence. First, we review the functional and structural properties of the LC-NE system and its impact on functional brain networks, cognition, and stress, with special emphasis on recent experimental and theoretical advances. Subsequently, we present an update about the role of LC-associated functions for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, focusing on the cognitive and motivational deficits. We propose that schizophrenia phenomenology, in particular cognitive symptoms, may be explained by an abnormal interaction between genetic susceptibility and stress-initiated LC-NE dysfunction. This in turn, leads to imbalance between LC activity modes, dysfunctional regulation of brain network integration and neural gain, and deficits in cognitive functions. Finally, we suggest how recent development of experimental approaches can be used to characterize LC function in schizophrenia.",2020
Pro-cognitive effect of 1MeTIQ on recognition memory in the ketamine model of schizophrenia in rats: the behavioural and neurochemical effects.,"Schizophrenia is a mental illness which is characterised by positive and negative symptoms and by cognitive impairments. While the major prevailing hypothesis is that altered dopaminergic and/or glutamatergic transmission contributes to this disease, there is evidence that the noradrenergic system also plays a role in its major symptoms. In the present paper, we investigated the pro-cognitive effect of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) an endogenous neuroprotective compound, on ketamine-modelled schizophrenia in rats. We used an antagonist of NMDA receptors (ketamine) to model memory deficit symptoms in rats. Using the novel object recognition (NOR) test, we investigated the pro-cognitive effect of 1MeTIQ. Additionally, olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, was used as a standard to compare the pro-cognitive effects of the substances. In vivo microdialysis studies allowed us to verify the changes in the release of monoamines and their metabolites in the rat striatum. Our study demonstrated that 1MeTIQ, similarly to olanzapine, exhibits a pro-cognitive effect in NOR test and enhances memory disturbed by ketamine treatment. Additionally, in vivo microdialysis studies have shown that ketamine powerfully increased noradrenaline release in the rat striatum, while 1MeTIQ and olanzapine completely antagonised this neurochemical effect. 1MeTIQ, as a possible pro-cognitive drug, in contrast to olanzapine, expresses beneficial neuroprotective activity in the brain, increasing concentration of the extraneuronal dopamine metabolite, 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), which plays an important physiological role in the brain as an inhibitory regulator of catecholaminergic activity. Moreover, we first demonstrated the essential role of noradrenaline release in memory disturbances observed in the ketamine-model of schizophrenia, and its possible participation in negative symptoms of the schizophrenia.",2020
"Effects of cariprazine on extracellular levels of glutamate, GABA, dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in the medial prefrontal cortex in the rat phencyclidine model of schizophrenia studied by microdialysis and simultaneous recordings of locomotor activity.","Aberrant glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission has been implicated in schizophrenia. Cariprazine reverses the behavioral effects observed in the rat phencyclidine (PCP)-induced model of schizophrenia; however, little is known about its in vivo neurochemistry. The study aims to compare the effects of cariprazine and aripiprazole on PCP-induced changes in the extracellular levels of glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and GABA in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and on locomotor activation. Microdialysis was performed in awake rats with probes placed into the mPFC. Rats (n = 7/group) received vehicle (saline), cariprazine (0.05, 0.2, or 0.8 mg/kg), or aripiprazole (3 or 20 mg/kg) via gavage. After 60 min, 5 mg/kg PCP was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Samples were taken before drug administration, during pretreatment, and after PCP injection. Locomotor activity recording and microdialysis sampling occurred simultaneously. PCP treatment increased extracellular levels of all the neurotransmitters tested except GABA, for which there were no significant changes. Cariprazine and aripiprazole dose-dependently inhibited the PCP-induced increases of tested neurotransmitters. Overall effects were significant for higher cariprazine doses and both aripiprazole doses for glutamate and noradrenaline, for higher cariprazine doses and 20 mg/kg aripiprazole for dopamine, and for 0.8 mg/kg cariprazine and 20 mg/kg aripiprazole for serotonin and locomotor activity. Both cariprazine and aripiprazole dose-dependently attenuated PCP-induced hyperlocomotion and acute increases in glutamate, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin levels in the mPFC; cariprazine was approximately 5-fold more potent than aripiprazole.",2018
Access to the CNS: Biomarker Strategies for Dopaminergic Treatments.,"Despite substantial research carried out over the last decades, it remains difficult to understand the wide range of pharmacological effects of dopaminergic agents. The dopaminergic system is involved in several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. This complex system features multiple pathways implicated in emotion and cognition, psychomotor functions and endocrine control through activation of G protein-coupled dopamine receptors. This review focuses on the system-wide effects of dopaminergic agents on the multiple biochemical and endocrine pathways, in particular the biomarkers (i.e., indicators of a pharmacological process) that reflect these effects. Dopaminergic treatments developed over the last decades were found to be associated with numerous biochemical pathways in the brain, including the norepinephrine and the kynurenine pathway. Additionally, they have shown to affect peripheral systems, for example the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Dopaminergic agents thus have a complex and broad pharmacological profile, rendering drug development challenging. Considering the complex system-wide pharmacological profile of dopaminergic agents, this review underlines the needs for systems pharmacology studies that include: i) proteomics and metabolomics analysis; ii) longitudinal data evaluation and mathematical modeling; iii) pharmacokinetics-based interpretation of drug effects; iv) simultaneous biomarker evaluation in the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma; and v) specific attention to condition-dependent (e.g., disease) pharmacology. Such approach is considered essential to increase our understanding of central nervous system (CNS) drug effects and substantially improve CNS drug development.",2018
Glucose homeostasis in major depression and schizophrenia: a comparison among drug-naïve first-episode patients.,"There is evidence for insulin resistance in drug-naïve first-episode schizophrenia (Sz) patients. We have tested whether impaired insulin homeostasis is also present in first-episode patients with major depression (MD) and if this can be discerned from stress-related and medication effects. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined in a cross-sectional cohort study of acute first-episode drug-naïve patients with MD (n = 18) or Sz (n = 24), and healthy controls (C, n = 43). Morning cortisol and catecholamine metabolites were assessed to control for hormonal stress axis activation. Subjects were matched for sex, age, body mass index and waist-hip ratio to exclude the possibility that overweight and visceral adiposity were potential confounding factors. HOMA-IR did not differ between MD and controls, but was increased in Sz compared to MD (p = 0.002) and controls (p = 0.012). Catecholamine metabolites were elevated in both patient groups, indicating presence of hormonal stress axis activation. However, diagnosis-related changes of HOMA-IR were independent from this. Impaired insulin sensitivity was absent in MD, but specifically related to the early disease course of Sz. Thus, considering previous studies in this field, MD may be related to impaired glucose/insulin homeostasis in the long-term but not in early disease stages.",2019
[The relationship between catechol O-methyltransferase and diseases].,"Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), one of the endogenous phase II metabolizing enzymes, expressed by chromosome 22. COMT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from common methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine(Ado Met or SAM) to one of the catechol hydroxyls. COMT participates in the metabolism of many catechols in vivo, e.g. dopamine, epinephrine, noradrenaline, estradiol. Furthermore COMT also plays important roles in the metabolism of xenobiotic catechols from food and drug. COMT play a critical role in the management of catechols. Metabolism disorders of COMT can cause many diseases or an increased risk of diseases, e.g. Pakinson diseases, schizophrenia, and breast cancer. In this review, we explains the relationship of COMT and related-diseases through expounding disease caused by the COMT metabolic disorders. Finally, we hope that there will be more effective treatments for the COMT metabolism related diseases.",2016
Can 5-HT3 antagonists contribute toward the treatment of schizophrenia?,"In one of his earlier papers, Lex Cools stated that the 'concept of an impaired balance between the in series connected […] dopamine system, […] 5-HT system and […] noradrenaline system offers a single coherent and integrated theory of schizophrenia' (Cools, 1975). Since then, considerable attention has focused on the interaction between dopamine and 5-HT and it is now well accepted that most antipsychotics (especially the second-generation drugs) modulate both dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. However, the vast majority of research has focused on the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. In the present paper, we review the literature pertaining to the 5-HT3 receptor, the only ionotropic 5-HT receptor. We discuss both the interactions between 5-HT3 receptors and dopamine, and the animal and human literature investigating the role of 5-HT3 receptors in schizophrenia. The results show that the interactions between 5-HT3 receptors and dopamine are complex, but that 5-HT3 receptors do not have a strong influence on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, when added to standard antipsychotic medication, several recent studies have found that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists can induce a statistically significantly improvement in negative and cognitive symptoms. The implications of these findings in relation to animal modelling and drug development are discussed.",2015
Effects of methamphetamine administration on information gathering during probabilistic reasoning in healthy humans.,"Jumping to conclusions (JTC) during probabilistic reasoning is a cognitive bias repeatedly demonstrated in people with schizophrenia and shown to be associated with delusions. Little is known about the neurochemical basis of probabilistic reasoning. We tested the hypothesis that catecholamines influence data gathering and probabilistic reasoning by administering intravenous methamphetamine, which is known to cause synaptic release of the catecholamines noradrenaline and dopamine, to healthy humans whilst they undertook a probabilistic inference task. Our study used a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. Seventeen healthy volunteers on three visits were administered either placebo or methamphetamine or methamphetamine preceded by amisulpride. In all three conditions participants performed the ""beads"" task in which participants decide how much information to gather before making a probabilistic inference, and which measures the cognitive bias towards jumping to conclusions. Psychotic symptoms triggered by methamphetamine were assessed using Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS). Methamphetamine induced mild psychotic symptoms, but there was no effect of drug administration on the number of draws to decision (DTD) on the beads task. DTD was a stable trait that was highly correlated within subjects across visits (intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.91 on two versions of the task). The less information was sampled in the placebo condition, the more psychotic-like symptoms the person had after the methamphetamine plus amisulpride condition (p = 0.028). Our results suggest that information gathering during probabilistic reasoning is a stable trait, not easily modified by dopaminergic or noradrenergic modulation.",2014
Is elevated norepinephrine an etiological factor in some cases of schizophrenia?,"A number of hypotheses have been put forth regarding the etiology of schizophrenia, including the dopamine hypothesis, NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis, and others. A lesser known theory is that elevated noradrenergic signaling plays a causative role in the disease. This paper briefly re-examines the merits of this hypothesis, including as it relates to some recently published studies. Several lines of evidence are investigated, including: endogenous level studies of norepinephrine (NE); modulation of the disease by noradrenergic drugs; association of the disease with bipolar disorder and hypertension, since these latter two conditions may involve elevated NE transmission; and effects of psychological stress on the disease, since stress can produce elevated release of NE. For many of these lines of evidence, their relationship with prepulse inhibition of startle is examined. A number of these studies support the hypothesis, and several suggest that elevated NE signaling plays a particularly prominent role in the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia. If the hypothesis is correct for some persons, conventional pharmaceutical treatment options, such as use of atypical antipsychotics (which may themselves modulate noradrenergic signaling), may be improved if selective NE transmission modulating agents are added to or even substituted for these conventional drugs.",2014
"Association of SOD2, GPX1, CAT, and TNF genetic polymorphisms with oxidative stress, neurochemistry, psychopathology, and extrapyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia.","There is a growing body of evidence confirming the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Inter-individual variation in antioxidant capacity caused by different genetic profile could potentially influence patient's susceptibility to oxidative damage. In this study we evaluated the polymorphisms of manganese superoxide dismutase SOD2Val16Ala, glutathione peroxidase GPX1Pro200Leu, catalase CAT-262C>T and CATc.66+78C>T, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha TNF-308G>A by assessing their association with biomarkers of oxidative stress, neurochemistry, psychopathology of schizophrenia and extrapyramidal symptoms in Caucasian schizophrenia patients treated with haloperidol depot. TNF-308G>A was associated with the increased risk of parkinsonism. No major role of polymorphism of SOD2Val16Ala, CAT-262C>T nor GPX1Pro200Leu in psychopathology of schizophrenia or extrapyramidal symptoms was observed. SOD2Val16Ala polymorphism was associated with dopamine plasma concentration and blood concentration ratio between reduced and oxidised form of glutathione, while GPX1Pro200Leu was related with concentration of reduced glutathione. CATc.66+78C>T was associated with noradrenaline plasma concentration and PANSS negative score. PANSS positive and general scores, were associated with the increased risk of tardive dyskinesia. PANSS positive, negative, and general scores, and GAF score were all associated with the increased risk of akathisia.",2013
"Altered spatial learning, cortical plasticity and hippocampal anatomy in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia-related endophenotypes.","Adult rats exposed to the DNA-methylating agent methylazoxymethanol on embryonic day 17 show a pattern of neurobiological deficits that model some of the neuropathological and behavioral changes observed in schizophrenia. Although it is generally assumed that these changes reflect targeted disruption of embryonic neurogenesis, it is unknown whether these effects generalise to other antimitotic agents administered at different stages of development. In the present study, neurochemical, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques were used to determine whether exposure to the antimitotic agent Ara-C later in development recapitulates some of the changes observed in methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-treated animals and in patients with schizophrenia. Male rats exposed to Ara-C (30 mg/kg/day) at embryonic days 19.5 and 20.5 show reduced cell numbers and heterotopias in hippocampal CA1 and CA2/3 regions, respectively, as well as cell loss in the superficial layers of the pre- and infralimbic cortex. Birth date labeling with bromodeoxyuridine reveals that the cytoarchitectural changes in CA2/3 are a consequence rather that a direct result of disrupted cortical neurogenesis. Ara-C-treated rats possess elevated levels of cortical dopamine and DOPAC (3,4-didyhydroxypheylacetic acid) but no change in norepinephrine or serotonin. Ara-C-treated rats are impaired in their ability to learn the Morris water maze task and showed diminished synaptic plasticity in the hippocampocortical pathway. These data indicate that disruption of neurogenesis at embryonic days 19.5 and 20.5 constitutes a useful model for the comparative study of deficits observed in other gestational models and their relationship to cognitive changes observed in schizophrenia.",2012

Prenatal lipopolysaccharide treatment enhances MK-801-induced psychotomimetic effects in rats.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, which is an animal developmental model of schizophrenia, on MK-801-induced psychotomimetic behavioral changes and brain aminergic system activity in adult offspring. Repeated LPS (1 mg/kg) injection in rats, that had started from 7th day of pregnancy and was continued every second day till delivery, resulted in a long-lasting disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) and elevation of locomotor activity in their offspring. The prenatally LPS-treated rats showed hypersensitivity to MK-801 (0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg) as evidenced by the enhancement of acoustic startle amplitude, reduced PPI, and enhanced locomotor activity. These behavioral changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dopamine and its metabolite, DOPAC concentration in the frontal cortex, enhanced dopaminergic system activity in the striatum and no changes in noradrenaline (NA) level. Furthermore, the significant augmentation of 5-HT and 5-HIAA content in the frontal cortex of females only was detected. No changes in the cortical NA tissue level were found. Summing up, the present study demonstrated that the activation of the immune system in prenatal period led to persistent behavioral hypersensitivity to psychotomimetic action of a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, and attention/information processing deficits. The foregoing data indicate that prenatal administration of LPS model some of the clinical aspects of schizophrenia and these behavioral effects are connected with neurochemical changes.",2011
Abnormal plasma monoamine metabolism in schizophrenia and its correlation with clinical responses to risperidone treatment.,"Abnormalities in plasma monoamine metabolism reflect partly the illness of schizophrenia and sometimes the symptoms. Such studies have been repeatedly reported but have rarely taken both metabolites and parent amines or inter-amine activity ratios into account. In this study, the monoamines, their metabolites, turnovers and between-metabolite ratios in plasma were measured longitudinally in 32 schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone for 6 weeks, to examine possible biochemical alterations in schizophrenia, and to examine the association between treatment responses and psychopathology assessed according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The results showed lower level of plasma 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in relapsed versus first-episode schizophrenic patients, higher norepinephrine (NE) turnover rate (TR) in undifferentiated in comparison to paranoid schizophrenic patients and relatively higher metabolic activity of dopamine (DA) to serotonin (5-HT) in first-episode versus relapsed schizophrenic patients. Risperidone treatment induced a decrement of plasma DA levels and increments of plasma DOPAC and DA TR in the total group of schizophrenic patients. The turnover rate of 5-HT was was reduced in undifferentiated and relapsed subgroups of schizophrenic patients. The linkages between 5-HT TR, DA/NE relative activity and clinical symptomatology were also identified. These findings are consistent with an involvement of these systems in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia as well as in the responses to treatment, and the usefulness of certain biochemical indices as markers for subgrouping.",2011
Selective enhancement of mesocortical dopaminergic transmission by noradrenergic drugs: therapeutic opportunities in schizophrenia.,"The superior efficacy of atypical vs. classical antipsychotic drugs to treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia appears related to their ability to enhance mesocortical dopamine (DA) function. Given that noradrenergic (NE) transmission contributes to cortical DA output, we assessed the ability of NE-targeting drugs to modulate DA release in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), with the aim of selectively increasing mesocortical DA. Extracellular DA was measured using brain microdialysis in rat mPFC and NAc after local/systemic drug administration, electrical stimulation and selective brain lesions. Local GBR12909 [a selective DA transporter (DAT) inhibitor] administration increased DA output more in NAc than in mPFC whereas reboxetine [a selective NE transporter (NET) inhibitor] had an opposite regional profile. DA levels increased comparably in both regions of control rats after local nomifensine (DAT+NET inhibitor) infusion, but this effect was much lower in PFC of NE-lesioned rats (DSP-4) and in NAc of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus preferentially enhanced DA output in mPFC. Consistently, the administration of reboxetine+RX821002 (an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist) dramatically enhanced DA output in mPFC (but not NAc). This effect also occurred when reboxetine+RX821002 were co-administered with haloperidol or clozapine. The preferential contribution of the NE system to PFC DA allows selective enhancement of DA transmission by simultaneously blocking NET and α2-adrenoceptors, thus preventing the autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback on NE activity. Our results highlight the importance of NET and α2-adrenoceptors as targets for treating negative/cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders.",2011
Dexamphetamine-induced reduction of P3a and P3b in healthy participants.,"The reduced P3 is one of the most robust deficits involved in schizophrenia. Previous research with catecholaminergic agonists or releasers such as amphetamines have used doses too small to adequately demonstrate an effect on P3. In this study, we gave 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine to healthy volunteers (final n = 18) using both auditory and visual three-stimulus P3 procedures. Dexamphetamine significantly reduced P3 amplitudes to auditory target, rare non-target and standard stimulus amplitudes. The reduction in auditory P3 induced by dexamphetamine was proportional across stimulus types to placebo P3 values. There were no effects of dexamphetamine on visual P3. We demonstrate a reduced auditory P3 similar to that seen in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. This possibly reflects a common pathology which is hypothesized within the P3 literature to be related to attention and working memory. Differences between auditory and visual P3 modulation may be related to regional variations in catecholamine or specifically dopamine receptor densities. One specific auditory P3 generator is the superior temporal cortex, an area with dopamine D(2) receptor enriched bands. This is contrasted with visual specific generators, such as the inferior temporal cortex and superior parietal cortex, which do not have these enriched bands.",2011
Impaired neuroendocrine and immune response to acute stress in medication-naive patients with a first episode of psychosis.,"Little is known about how the biological stress response systems--the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the immune system--function during psychosis. Results of studies on the effect of stress on the immune and autonomic system in patients with schizophrenia are inconsistent. The present study investigates whether the stress response is impaired in medication-naive patients with a first episode of psychosis. Ten male patients with a first episode of psychosis and 15 controls were exposed to the stress of public speaking. Parameters of the ANS (heart rate and catecholamines), the HPA axis (plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] and cortisol), and the immune system (number and activity of natural killer [NK] cells) were measured. Peak responses were calculated to examine the relationship between stress-induced activation of the different systems. Subjective stress and anxiety before and during the task were assessed. Patients and controls displayed similar autonomic responses to acute stress. However, there was an impaired HPA axis response, slow onset and return of ACTH, and flattened cortisol response and a reduced increase in number NK cells and NK cell activity in patients with a first episode of psychosis. Furthermore, in patients, the relationship between the different stress response systems was weaker or absent compared with controls. These findings indicate that impairments in stress processing are associated with the endophenotype of psychosis and are not a result of illness progression or antipsychotic medication.",2012
The novel neurotensin analog NT69L blocks phencyclidine (PCP)-induced increases in locomotor activity and PCP-induced increases in monoamine and amino acids levels in the medial prefrontal cortex.,"Schizophrenia is a life-long, severe, and disabling brain disorder that requires chronic pharmacotherapy. Because current antipsychotic drugs do not provide optimal therapy, we have been developing novel treatments that focus on receptors for the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT). NT69L, an analog of neurotensin(8-13), acts like an atypical antipsychotic drug in several dopamine-based animal models used to study schizophrenia. Another current animal model utilizes non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA/glutamate receptor, such as the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP). In the present study, we investigated the effects of NT69L on PCP-induced behavioral and biochemical changes in the rat. The top of an activity chamber was modified to allow us to perform microdialysis in rat brain, while simultaneously recording the locomotor activity of a rat. PCP injection significantly increased activity as well as the extracellular concentration of norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT, dopamine (DA), and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pretreating with NT69L blocked the PCP-induced hyperactivity as well as the increase of DA, 5-HT, NE, and glutamate in mPFC. Interestingly and unexpectedly, NT69L markedly increased glycine levels, while PCP was without effect on glycine levels. Thus, NT69L showed antipsychotic-like effects in this glutamate-based animal model for studying schizophrenia. Previous work from our group suggests that NT69L also has antipsychotic-like effects in dopaminergic and serotonergic rodent models. Taken together, these data suggest that NT69L in particular and NT receptor agonists in general, will be useful as broad-spectrum antipsychotic drugs.",2010
Associations between plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and negative symptoms or cognitive impairments in early-stage schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenic patients demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, including attention, executive functions, and working memory, even in the early stage of disease. In the present study, we examined the association between blood levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in patients with early-stage schizophrenia. We also investigated the association between frontal GABA levels using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3T and scores on the WCST in the same patients. Blood levels of BDNF and catecholamine metabolites and brain GABA levels using 1H-MRS were measured in 18 schizophrenic patients (nine males, nine females; age range 13-52 year). A significantly positive correlation was observed between plasma MHPG levels and %PEM (rho = -0.686, p = 0.0047). A trend toward negative correlation was found between frontal lobe GABA levels and the per cent of preservation error (%PEM) in the early stage of schizophrenia (rho = -0.420, p = 0.0836). These results suggest that noradrenergic neurons might be involved in neuropsychological functions in early-stage of schizophrenia.",2009
Improving antidepressant drugs: update on recently patented compounds.,"According to the WHO, depression is a common condition that affects about 121 million people worldwide. Although the pathophysiological origin of this condition is still unknown, most of the known antidepressants enhance the extracellular availability of brain monoamines (serotonin and/or noradrenaline). We have searched for the potential drugs and targets addressed in the most recent patents. Hence, we have explored the Patent Database of the European Patent Office using the esp@cenet search engine for the period 2005 - 2008, looking for ""anti depressants"". In addition, a search in the Medtrack database yielded information on pharmaceutical companies developing compounds as antidepressants, market size and their market prospects. We have found that, in general, the preferred targets to develop antidepressants continue to be those aiming the serotoninergic system and, in a less extend, the noradrenergic one; but, more particularly, those that aim several targets are preferred due to problems concerning the efficacy of highly selective drugs. Additionally, a small number of new systems are being targeted, such as the melatonergic. However, when looking at the pharma-market and the antidepressants in the pipeline, a new trend is observed in the developing of dual-action drugs that could be used in depression and schizophrenia therapy.",2009
Construction and application of magnetic surface molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction for the detection of 5-hydroxytryptamine in peripheral blood.,"The 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level determination is crucial for predicting, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. To realize the extraction of trace 5-HT in complex matrix samples, a magnetic molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MMISPE) pretreatment method was developed. In combination with UPLC-MS/MS, the method was possible to achieve the quantification of 1 ng/mL 5-HT in tissue samples. The type of adsorbent, magnetic surface molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) adsorbent dosage, adsorption temperature, and adsorption method were screened to obtain the better extraction of 5-HT. After optimizing the extraction and separation method, we applied the MMISPE method to the detection of 5-HT in peripheral blood of clinical schizophrenia patients. The results showed that the average concentration of 5-HT in the peripheral blood of healthy controls was 74.30 ng/mL, whereas the 5-HT content in the samples from schizophrenic patients was 1.17 ng/mL.",2025
The relationship between alcohol bingeing in the gestational period of wistar rats and the development of schizophrenia in the offspring adult life.,"The incidence of schizophrenia in young adulthood may be associated with intrauterine factors, such as gestational alcohol consumption. This study investigated the relationship between a single high dose of alcohol during pregnancy in Wistar rats and the development of schizophrenia in the adult life of the offspring. On the 11th day of gestation, pregnant rats received either water or alcohol via intragastric gavage. Male and female offspring were subjected to behavioral tests at 30 days of age according to the maternal group. At 60 days of age, offspring received intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (ket) or saline (SAL). After the final ketamine administration, the adult offspring underwent behavioral tests, and their brain structures were removed for biochemical analysis. Alcohol binge drinking during pregnancy induces hyperlocomotion in both young female and male offspring, with males of alcohol-exposed mothers showing reduced social interactions. In adult offspring, ketamine induced hyperlocomotion; however, only females in the alcohol + ket group exhibited increased locomotor activity, and a decrease in the time to first contact was observed in the alcohol group. Cognitive impairment was exclusively observed in male animals in the alcohol group. Increased serotonin and dopamine levels were observed in male rats in the alcohol + ket group. Biochemical alterations indicate the effects of intrauterine alcohol exposure associated with ketamine in adult animals. These behavioral and biochemical changes suggest that the impact of prenatal stressors such as alcohol persists throughout the animals' lives and may be exacerbated by a second stressor in adulthood, such as ketamine.",2024
G protein-specific mechanisms in the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor regulate psychosis-related effects and memory deficits.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are sophisticated signaling machines able to simultaneously elicit multiple intracellular signaling pathways upon activation. Complete (in)activation of all pathways can be counterproductive for specific therapeutic applications. This is the case for the serotonin 2 A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R), a prominent target for the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, we elucidate the complex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R coupling signature in response to different signaling probes, and its physiological consequences by combining computational modeling, in vitro and in vivo experiments with human postmortem brain studies. We show how chemical modification of the endogenous agonist serotonin dramatically impacts the G protein coupling profile of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R and the associated behavioral responses. Importantly, among these responses, we demonstrate that memory deficits are regulated by G<sub>αq</sub> protein activation, whereas psychosis-related behavior is modulated through G<sub>αi1</sub> stimulation. These findings emphasize the complexity of GPCR pharmacology and physiology and open the path to designing improved therapeutics for the treatment of stchizophrenia.",2024
Pharmacological fingerprint of antipsychotic drugs at the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor.,"The intricate involvement of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) both in schizophrenia and in the activity of antipsychotic drugs is widely acknowledged. The currently marketed antipsychotic drugs, although effective in managing the symptoms of schizophrenia to a certain extent, are not without their repertoire of serious side effects. There is a need for better therapeutics to treat schizophrenia for which understanding the mechanism of action of the current antipsychotic drugs is imperative. With bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, we trace the signaling signature of six antipsychotic drugs belonging to three generations at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R for the entire spectrum of signaling pathways activated by serotonin (5-HT). The antipsychotic drugs display previously unidentified pathway preference at the level of the individual Gα subunits and β-arrestins. In particular, risperidone, clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol showed G protein-selective inverse agonist activity. In addition, G protein-selective partial agonism was found for aripiprazole and cariprazine. Pathway-specific apparent dissociation constants determined from functional analyses revealed distinct coupling-modulating capacities of the tested antipsychotics at the different 5-HT-activated pathways. Computational analyses of the pharmacological and structural fingerprints support a mechanistically based clustering that recapitulate the clinical classification (typical/first generation, atypical/second generation, third generation) of the antipsychotic drugs. The study provides a new framework to functionally classify antipsychotics that should represent a useful tool for the identification of better and safer neuropsychiatric drugs and allows formulating hypotheses on the links between specific signaling cascades and in the clinical outcomes of the existing drugs.",2024

Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract attenuates MK801-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice: Participation of intestinal flora.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a psychotic mental disorder characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and social impairments. However, current pharmacological treatment regimens are subpar in terms of effectiveness. This study aimed to investigate the function of Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract in SCZ in mouse models. The SCZ mouse model was established by MK-801 injection and feeding of Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract or combined antibiotics. Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract significantly improved the aberrant behaviors and neuronal damage in SCZ mice, upregulated SYP and PSD-95 expression and BDNF levels in hippocampal homogenates, down-regulated DA and 5-HT levels, and suppressed microglial activation in SCZ mice. Moreover, Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract improved the integrity of the intestinal tract barrier. The 16 S rRNA sequencing of feces showed that Radix Bupleuri extract modulated the composition of gut flora. Lactobacillus abundance was decreased in SCZ mice and reversed by Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract administration which exhibited a significant negative correlation with IL-6, IL-1β, DA, and 5-HT, and a significant positive correlation with BDNF levels in hippocampal tissues. The abundance of Parabacteroides and Alloprevotella was increased in SCZ mice. It was reversed by Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract administration, which exhibited a positive correlation with IL-6, IL-1β, and 5-HT and a negative correlation with BDNF. In conclusion, Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract attenuates the inflammatory response in hippocampal tissues and modulates neurotransmitter levels, exerting its neuroprotective effect in SCZ. Meanwhile, the alteration of intestinal flora may be involved in this process, which is expected to be an underlying therapeutic option in treating SCZ.",2024
Psychedelics action and schizophrenia.,"Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation and induce several behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists in schizophrenia therapy.",2023
"Lurasidone for the Treatment of Schizophrenia: Design, Development, and Place in Therapy.","This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature on the drug design, development, and therapy of lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. Lurasidone has antagonistic effects on the dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors and a partial agonistic effect on the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor with low affinities for muscarinic M<sub>1</sub>, histamine H<sub>1</sub>, and a<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors. The receptor-binding profile of lurasidone is thought to be associated with fewer side effects such as anticholinergic effects, lipid abnormalities, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. Behavioral pharmacological studies have demonstrated that lurasidone exerts anxiolytic and antidepressive effects and improves cognitive function, which are associated with the modulation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Literature search using PubMed was performed to find published studies of randomized controlled trials and recent meta-analyses regarding efficacy and safety, particularly metabolic side effects of lurasidone in schizophrenia. In short-term studies, the results of randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses have suggested that lurasidone was superior to placebo in improving total psychopathology, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology in patients with acute schizophrenia. Regarding safety, lurasidone had minimal metabolic side effects, and was identified as one of the drugs with the most benign profiles for metabolic side effects. Long-term trials revealed that lurasidone had the preventive effects on relapse, with minimal effects on weight gain and other metabolic side effects. Furthermore, lurasidone improves cognitive and functional performance of patients with schizophrenia, especially in long-term treatment. Patients with schizophrenia require long-term treatment with antipsychotics for relapse prevention; thus, minimizing weight gain and other side effects is crucial. Lurasidone is suitable as one of the first-line antipsychotic drugs in the acute phase, and a switching strategy should be considered during the maintenance phase, to balance efficacy and adverse effects and achieve favorable outcomes in the long-term course of schizophrenia.",2023
Putative neural mechanisms underlying release-mode-specific abnormalities in dopamine neural activity in a schizophrenia-like model: The distinct roles of glutamate and serotonin in the impaired regulation of dopamine neurons.,"Abnormalities in dopamine function might be related to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Even at the same concentration, dopamine exerts opposite effects on information processing in the prefrontal cortex depending on independent dopamine release modes known as tonic and phasic releases. This duality of dopamine prevents a blanket interpretation of the implications of dopamine abnormalities for diseases on the basis of absolute dopamine levels. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the mode-specific dopamine abnormalities are not clearly understood. Here, I show that the two modes of dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex of a schizophrenia-like model are disrupted by different mechanisms. In the schizophrenia-like model established by perinatal exposure to inflammatory cytokine, epidermal growth factor, tonic release was enhanced and phasic release was decreased in the prefrontal cortex. I examined the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which sends dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex, under anaesthesia. The activation of VTA dopamine neurons during excitatory stimulation (local application of glutamate or N-methyl-d-aspartic acid [NMDA]), which is associated with phasic activity, was blunt in this model. Dopaminergic neuronal activity in the resting state related to tonic release was increased by disinhibition of the dopamine neurons due to the impairment of 5HT2 (5HT2A) receptor-regulated GABAergic inputs. Moreover, chronic administration of risperidone ameliorated this disinhibition of dopaminergic neurons. These results provide an idea about the mechanism of dopamine disturbance in schizophrenia and may be informative in explaining the effects of atypical antipsychotics as distinct from those of typical drugs.",2024
"NU-1223, a simplified analog of alstonine, with 5-HT<sub>2c</sub>R agonist-like activity, rescues memory deficit and positive and negative symptoms in subchronic phencyclidine mouse model of schizophrenia.","The serotonin (5-HT)<sub>2 C</sub> receptor(R) is a widely distributed G-protein-coupled receptor, expressed abundantly in the central nervous system. Alstonine is a natural product that has significant properties of atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs), in part attributed to 5-HT<sub>2 C</sub>R agonism. Based on alstonine, we developed NU-1223, a simplified β carboline analog of alstonine, which shows efficacies comparable to alstonine and to other 5-HT<sub>2 C</sub>R agonists, Ro-60-0175 and lorcaserin. The 5-HT<sub>2 C</sub>R antagonism of some APDs, including olanzapine, contributes to weight gain, a major side effect which limits its tolerability, while the 5-HT<sub>2 C</sub>R agonists and/or modulators, may minimize weight gain. We used the well-established rodent subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) model to test the efficacy of NU-1223 on episodic memory, using novel object recognition (NOR) task, positive (locomotor activity), and negative symptoms (social interaction) of schizophrenia (SCH). We found that NU-1223 produced both transient and prolonged rescue of the subchronic PCP-induced deficits in NOR and SI. Further, NU-1223, but not Ro-60-0175, blocked PCP and amphetamine (AMPH)-induced increase in LMA in subchronic PCP mice. These transient efficacies in LMA were blocked by the 5-HT<sub>2 C</sub>R antagonist, SB242084. Sub-chronic NU-1223 treatment rescued NOR and SI deficits in subchronic PCP mice for at least 39 days after 3 days injection. Chronic treatment with NU-1223, ip, twice a day for 21 days, did not increase average body weight vs olanzapine. These findings clearly indicate NU-1223 as a class of small molecules with a possible 5-HT<sub>2 C</sub>R-agonist-like mechanism of action, attributing to its efficacy. Additional in-depth receptor mechanistic studies are warranted, as this small molecule, both transiently and chronically rescued PCP-induced deficits. Furthermore, NU-1223 did not induce weight gain post long-term administrations vs AAPDs such as olanzapine, making NU-1223 a putative therapeutic compound for SCH.",2023
Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in schizophrenia: Reflexions on an unfinished story.,,2023
Spatiotemporal dynamics of functional connectivity and association with molecular architecture in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a self-disorder characterized by disrupted brain dynamics and architectures of multiple molecules. This study aims to explore spatiotemporal dynamics and its association with psychiatric symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 98 patients with schizophrenia. Brain dynamics included the temporal and spatial variations in functional connectivity density and association with symptom scores were evaluated. Moreover, the spatial association between dynamics and receptors/transporters according to prior molecular imaging in healthy subjects was examined. Patients demonstrated decreased temporal variation and increased spatial variation in perceptual and attentional systems. However, increased temporal variation and decreased spatial variation were revealed in higher order networks and subcortical networks in patients. Specifically, spatial variation in perceptual and attentional systems was associated with symptom severity. Moreover, case-control differences were associated with dopamine, serotonin and mu-opioid receptor densities, serotonin reuptake transporter density, dopamine transporter density, and dopamine synthesis capacity. Therefore, this study implicates the abnormal dynamic interactions between the perceptual system and cortical core networks; in addition, the subcortical regions play a role in the dynamic interaction among the cortical regions in schizophrenia. These convergent findings support the importance of brain dynamics and emphasize the contribution of primary information processing to the pathological mechanism underlying schizophrenia.",2023
"Novel multi-target ligands of dopamine and serotonin receptors for the treatment of schizophrenia based on indazole and piperazine scaffolds-synthesis, biological activity, and structural evaluation.","Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that is not satisfactorily treated with available antipsychotics. The presented study focuses on the search for new antipsychotics by optimising the compound D2AAK3, a multi-target ligand of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in particular D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Such receptor profile may be beneficial for the treatment of schizophrenia. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>16</b> were designed, synthesised, and subjected to further evaluation. Their affinities for the above-mentioned receptors were assessed in radioligand binding assays and efficacy towards them in functional assays. Compounds <b>1</b> and <b>10</b>, selected based on their receptor profile, were subjected to <i>in vivo</i> tests to evaluate their antipsychotic activity, and effect on memory and anxiety processes. Molecular modelling was performed to investigate the interactions of the studied compounds with D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors on the molecular level. Finally, X-ray study was conducted for compound <b>1</b>, which revealed its stable conformation in the solid state.",2023
"Discovery of novel arylpiperazine-based DA/5-HT modulators as potential antipsychotic agents - Design, synthesis, structural studies and pharmacological profiling.","Schizophrenia is a mental disorder with a complex pathomechanism involving many neurotransmitter systems. Among the currently used antipsychotics, classical drugs acting as dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, and drugs of a newer generation, the so-called atypical antipsychotics, can be distinguished. The latter are characterized by a multi-target profile of action, affecting, apart from the D<sub>2</sub> receptor, also serotonin receptors, in particular 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>. Such profile of action is considered superior in terms of both efficacy in treating symptoms and safety. In the search for new potential antipsychotics of such atypical receptor profile, an attempt was made to optimize the arylpiperazine based virtual hit, D2AAK3, which in previous studies displayed an affinity for D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, and showed antipsychotic activity in vivo. In this work, we present the design of D2AAK3 derivatives (1-17), their synthesis, and structural and pharmacological evaluation. The obtained compounds show affinities for the receptors of interest and their efficacy as antagonists/agonists towards them was confirmed in functional assays. For the selected compound 11, detailed structural studies were carried out using molecular modeling and X-ray methods. Additionally, ADMET parameters and in vivo antipsychotic activity, as well as influence on memory and anxiety processes were evaluated in mice, which indicated good therapeutic potential and safety profile of the studied compound.",2023
The crosstalk between 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R and mGluR2 in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder that usually produces a lifetime of disability. First generation or typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol and second generation or atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and risperidone remain the current standard for schizophrenia treatment. In some patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotics produce complete remission of positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. However, antipsychotic drugs are ineffective against cognitive deficits and indeed treated schizophrenia patients have small improvements or even deterioration in several cognitive domains. This underlines the need for novel and more efficient therapeutic targets for schizophrenia treatment. Serotonin and glutamate have been identified as key parts of two neurotransmitter systems involved in fundamental brain processes. Serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) and metabotropic glutamate 2 receptor (mGluR2) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that interact at epigenetic and functional levels. These two receptors can form GPCR heteromeric complexes through which their pharmacology, function and trafficking becomes affected. Here we review past and current research on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-mGluR2 heterocomplex and its potential implication in schizophrenia and antipsychotic drug action. This article is part of the Special Issue on ""The receptor-receptor interaction as a new target for therapy"".",2023
"Design, Synthesis, Molecular Docking, and Preliminary Pharmacological Screening of some New Benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylamino Containing Chromen-2- one Derivatives with Atypical Antipsychotic Profile.","Mental disorders are very serious complicated disorders. Schizophrenia is one of the most baffling mental disorders. The new series 7-(2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2- ylamino)ethoxy)-4-methyl-2H-chromen-2- synthesized in search of newer compounds for Schizophrenia. Synthesis is done by refluxing in dry pyridine with various substituted 2-amino benzothiazoles derivatives (3a-3k) and 7-(2-Chloroethoxy)-4-methyl-2H-chromen-2-one (2). The molecular docking approach was used to screen these generated derivatives. Chem Bio Draw Ultra 12 was used to draw the compounds, which were then exposed to all potential conformations of compounds interacting with receptors. The Glide 7.6, Schrodinger 2017 Maestro 11.3 was used to achieve molecular docking. The Dopamine receptor 6CM4 serotonin 5TUD PDBs were acquired from the database of Brookhaven Protein. Using the OPLS 2005 force field, the ligand-protein hydrogen-bond network was acquired, along with the overall energy reduced. A glide score was used to rate the docking poses. The produced compounds have been identified with the use of analytical and spectral data. All of the produced substances were tested and analyzed for serotonin 5HT2 antagonistic and dopamine D2 activity, which can be considered as a measure of typical antipsychotic properties. Compounds 4b, 4c, 4e, 4g & 4i have demonstrated promising pharmacological action in preliminary studies. According to the preceding findings, compounds with electronwithdrawing substitutions, such as 4e & 4b, have a good atypical profile of antipsychotics.",2023
Understanding translational research in schizophrenia: A novel insight into animal models.,"Schizophrenia affects millions of people worldwide and is a major challenge for the scientific community. Like most psychotic diseases, it is also considered a complicated mental disorder caused by an imbalance in neurotransmitters. Due to the complexity of neuropathology, it is always a complicated disorder. The lack of proper understanding of the pathophysiology makes the disorder unmanageable in clinical settings. However, due to recent advances in animal models, we hope we can have better therapeutic approaches with more success in clinical settings. Dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and serotonin are the neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Various animal models have been put forward based on these neurotransmitters, including pharmacological, neurodevelopmental, and genetic models. Polymorphism of genes such as dysbindin, DICS1, and NRG1 has also been reported in schizophrenia. Hypothesis based on dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin are considered successful models of schizophrenia on which drug therapies have been designed to date. New targets like the orexin system, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, and cannabinoid receptors have been approached to alleviate the negative and cognitive symptoms. The non-pharmacological models like the post-weaning social isolation model (maternal deprivation), the isolation rearing model etc. have been also developed to mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia and to create and test new approaches of drug therapy which is a breakthrough at present in psychiatric disorders. Different behavioral tests have been evaluated in these specific models. This review will highlight the currently available animal models and behavioral tests in psychic disorders concerning schizophrenia.",2023
"Reversal and Preventive Pleiotropic Mechanisms Involved in the Antipsychotic-Like Effect of Taurine, an Essential β-Amino Acid in Ketamine-Induced Experimental Schizophrenia in Mice.","Schizophrenia is a life disabling, multisystem neuropsychiatric disease mostly derived from complex epigenetic-mediated neurobiological changes causing behavioural deficits. Neurochemical disorganizations, neurotrophic and neuroimmune alterations are some of the challenging neuropathologies proving unabated during psychopharmacology of schizophrenia, further bedeviled by drug-induced metabolic derangements including alteration of amino acids. In first-episode schizophrenia patients, taurine, an essential β-amino acid represses psychotic-symptoms. However, its anti-psychotic-like mechanisms remain incomplete. This study evaluated the ability of taurine to prevent or reverse ketamine-induced experimental psychosis and the underlying neurochemical, neurotrophic and neuroinmune mechanisms involved in taurine's clinical action. The study consisted of three different experiments with Swiss mice (n = 7). In the drug alone, mice received saline (10 mL/kg/p.o./day), taurine (50 and 100 mg/kg/p.o./day) and risperidone (0.5 mg/kg/p.o./day) for 14 days. In the preventive study of separate cohort, mice were concomitantly given ketamine (20 mg/kg/i.p./day) from days 8 to 14. In the reversal study, mice received ketamine for 14 days before taurine or risperidone treatments from days 8 to 14 respectively. Afterwards, stereotypy behaviour, social, non-spatial memory deficits, and body weights were assessed. Neurochemical (dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, glutamic acid decarboxylase, (GAD)), brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (TNF-α), interleukin-6, (IL-6)] were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampal area. Taurine attenuates ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like behaviour without changes in body weight. Taurine reduced ketamine-induced dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine changes, and increased GAD and BDNF levels in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus, suggesting increased GABAergic and neurotrophic transmissions. Taurine decreases ketamine-induced increased in TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus. These findings also suggest that taurine protects against schizophrenia through neurochemical modulations, neurotrophic enhancement, and inhibition of neuropathologic cytokine activities.",2023
"Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Cariprazine in Pediatric Patients with Bipolar I Disorder or Schizophrenia.","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Cariprazine is a dopamine D<sub>3</sub>-preferring D<sub>3</sub>/D<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist approved to treat adults with schizophrenia and manic/mixed or depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. This sequential-cohort, dose-escalation study was the first to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profile of cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, desmethyl-cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl-cariprazine (DDCAR), in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This phase I open-label study enrolled patients with schizophrenia (13-17 years of age) or bipolar I disorder (10-17 years of age). Patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and had Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores ≥70 or Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores ≥20. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups to receive 6 weeks of cariprazine treatment through slow titration to 1.5, 3, or 4.5 mg/d or fast titration to 4.5 mg/d. Pharmacokinetics, adverse events (AEs), and various safety parameters were analyzed. Efficacy was evaluated as an exploratory outcome. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 50 participants were enrolled. Based on mean trough levels, steady state appeared to be reached within 1-2 weeks for cariprazine and DCAR and within 4-5 weeks for DDCAR. Systemic exposure of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR generally increased approximately in proportion to the increases in dose from 1.5 to 4.5 mg/d. The most frequent treatment-related, treatment-emergent AEs included sedation, parkinsonism, tremor, dystonia, and blurred vision. Improvements from baseline on the PANSS and YMRS were observed throughout treatment. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In this first investigation of cariprazine in a pediatric population with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with those observed in adults. Cariprazine appeared to be safe and tolerable in children and adolescents.",2022
Role of interaction of mGlu2 and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in antipsychotic effects.,"The serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and increasing evidence shows that they interact functionally. Of note, the G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) and the G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled metabotropic glutamate type 2 (mGlu2) receptors have been demonstrated to assemble into a functional heteromeric complex that modulates the function of each individual receptor. For conformation of the heteromeric complex, corresponding transmembrane-4 segment of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and mGlu2 are required. The 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/mGlu2 heteromeric complex is necessary for the activation of G<sub>q/11</sub> proteins and for the subsequent increase in the levels of the intracellular messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, signaling via the heteromeric complex is dysregulated in the post-mortem brains of patients with schizophrenia, and could be linked to altered cortical function. From a behavioral perspective, this complex contributes to the hallucinatory and antipsychotic behaviors associated with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and mGlu2/3 agonists, respectively. Synaptic and epigenetic mechanisms have also been found to be significantly associated with the mGlu2/5-HT<sub>2A</sub> heteromeric complex. This review summarizes the role of crosstalk between mGlu2 and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> in the mechanism of antipsychotic effects and introduces recent key advancements on this topic.",2022
Glucocorticoid receptor dysregulation underlies 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-dependent synaptic and behavioral deficits in a mouse neurodevelopmental disorder model.,"Prenatal environmental insults increase the risk of neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions in the offspring. Structural modifications of dendritic spines are central to brain development and plasticity. Using maternal immune activation (MIA) as a rodent model of prenatal environmental insult, previous results have reported dendritic structural deficits in the frontal cortex. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying MIA-induced synaptic structural alterations in the offspring. Using prenatal (E12.5) injection with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid potassium salt as a mouse MIA model, we show here that upregulation of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) is at least in part responsible for some of the effects of prenatal insults on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and sensorimotor gating processes. Mechanistically, we report that this upregulation of frontal cortex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression is associated with MIA-induced reduction of nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, consequently, a decrease in the enrichment of GR at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R promoter. The translational significance of these preclinical findings is supported by data in postmortem human brain samples suggesting dysregulation of GR translocation in frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. We also found that repeated corticosterone administration augmented frontal cortex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression and reduced GR binding to the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R promoter. However, virally (adeno-associated virus) mediated augmentation of GR function reduced frontal cortex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression and improved sensorimotor gating processes via 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R. Together, these data support a negative regulatory relationship between GR signaling and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression in the mouse frontal cortex that may carry implications for the pathophysiology underlying 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R dysregulation in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.",2022
Association between the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials and age in patients with schizophrenia and depression.,"Although serotonergic dysfunction is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), comparison of serotonergic dysfunction in both diseases has received little attention. Serotonin hypotheses have suggested diminished and elevated serotonin activity in MDD and SCZ, respectively. However, the foundations underlying these hypotheses are unclear regarding changes in serotonin neurotransmission in the aging brain. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) reflects serotonin neurotransmission. The present study compared the LDAEP between patients with SCZ or MDD and healthy controls (HCs). We further examined whether age was correlated with the LDAEP and clinical symptoms. This prospective clinical study included 105 patients with SCZ (n = 54) or MDD (n = 51). Additionally, 35 HCs were recruited for this study. The LDAEP was measured on the midline channels via 62 electroencephalography channels. Patients with SCZ or MDD showed a significantly smaller mean LDAEP than those in HCs. The LDAEP was positively correlated with age in patients with SCZ or MDD. Changes in central serotonergic activity could be indicated by evaluating the LDAEP in patients with SCZ or MDD. Age-related reductions in serotonergic activity may be screened using the LDAEP in patients with SCZ or MDD.",2022
Identification of cerebrospinal fluid and serum metabolomic biomarkers in first episode psychosis patients.,"Psychotic disorders are currently diagnosed by examining the patient's mental state and medical history. Identifying reliable diagnostic, monitoring, predictive, or prognostic biomarkers would be useful in clinical settings and help to understand the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here, we performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectroscopy on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples of 25 patients at their first-episode psychosis (FEP) manifestation (baseline) and after 18 months (follow-up). CSF and serum samples of 21 healthy control (HC) subjects were also analyzed. By comparing FEP and HC groups at baseline, we found eight CSF and 32 serum psychosis-associated metabolites with non-redundant identifications. Most remarkable was the finding of increased CSF serotonin (5-HT) levels. Most metabolites identified at baseline did not differ between groups at 18-month follow-up with significant improvement of positive symptoms and cognitive functions. Comparing FEP patients at baseline and 18-month follow-up, we identified 20 CSF metabolites and 90 serum metabolites that changed at follow-up. We further utilized Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified candidate signaling pathways involved in psychosis pathogenesis and progression. In an extended cohort, we validated that CSF 5-HT levels were higher in FEP patients than in HC at baseline by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. To conclude, these findings provide insights into the pathophysiology of psychosis and identify potential psychosis-associated biomarkers.",2022
"Mismatch negativity as an index of target engagement for excitation/inhibition-based treatment development: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose cross-over study of the serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist CVN058.","Serotonin type-3 receptor (5-HT<sub>3</sub>R) antagonists show potential as a treatment for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. CVN058, a brain-penetrant, potent and selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R antagonist, shows efficacy in rodent models of cognition and was well-tolerated in Phase-1 studies. We evaluated the target engagement of CVN058 using mismatch negativity (MMN) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Subjects were stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with antipsychotics. Subjects were not permitted to use other 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R modulators or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Each subject received a high (150 mg) and low (15 mg or 75 mg) oral dose of CVN058 and placebo in a randomized order across 3 single-day treatment visits separated by at least 1 week. The primary pre-registered outcome was amplitude of duration MMN. Amplitude of other MMN deviants (frequency, intensity, frequency modulation, and location), P50, P300 and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were exploratory endpoints. 19 of 22 randomized subjects (86.4%) completed the study. Baseline PANSS scores indicated moderate impairment. CVN058 150 mg led to significant improvement vs. placebo on the primary outcome of duration MMN (p = 0.02, Cohen's d = 0.48). A significant treatment effect was also seen in a combined analysis across all MMN deviants (p < 0.001, d = 0.57). Effects on location MMN were independently significant (p < 0.007, d = 0.46). No other significant effects were seen for other deviants, doses or EEG measures. There were no clinically significant treatment related adverse effects. These results show MMN to be a sensitive target engagement biomarker for 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, and support the potential utility of CVN058 in correcting the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia.",2022
Opposite alterations of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor brain density in subjects with schizophrenia: relevance of radiotracers pharmacological profile.,"The status of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs) in schizophrenia has been controversial. In vivo positron emission tomography neuroimaging and in vitro post-mortem binding studies have reported conflicting results about 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density. Radiotracers bind different receptor conformations depending on their agonist, antagonist or inverse agonist properties. This study investigates 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex from subjects with schizophrenia and controls using three radiotracers with a different pharmacological profile. The specific binding parameters of the inverse agonist [<sup>18</sup>F]altanserin, the agonist [<sup>3</sup>H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the antagonist [<sup>3</sup>H]MDL100907 to brain cortex membranes from 20 subjects with schizophrenia and 20 individually matched controls were evaluated under similar methodological conditions. Ten schizophrenia subjects were antipsychotic-free at death. Saturation curve analyses were performed by non-linear regression to obtain a maximal density of binding sites (B<sub>max</sub>) and the affinity of the respective radiotracers (K<sub>d</sub>). In schizophrenia subjects, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density was decreased when quantified by [<sup>18</sup>F]altanserin binding, whereas increased when evaluated by [<sup>3</sup>H]LSD binding. However, [<sup>3</sup>H]MDL100907 binding was unaltered. A slight loss of affinity (higher K<sub>d</sub>) was observed exclusively in [<sup>3</sup>H]LSD binding. The findings were more evident in antipsychotic-free subjects than in antipsychotic-treated subjects. In conclusion, a higher proportion of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-active functional conformation, which is rather identified by agonist radiotracers, was observed in schizophrenia patients. A consequent reduction of the inactive 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R conformation, which is preferentially identified by inverse agonist radiotracers, was also obtained. Antagonist radiotracers do not distinguish between molecular conformations of the receptor, and accordingly, the absence of changes was shown. These results are compatible with the proposed increased functional activity of brain cortical 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in schizophrenia.",2021
