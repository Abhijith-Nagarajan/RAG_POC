        "title": "Neuroendocrine characterization into schizophrenia: norepinephrine and melatonin as promising biomarkers.",
        "abstract": "Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)has garnered extensive attention as a neuroendocrine marker in schizophrenia (SZ), its clinical utility remains limite due to inconsistent findings. To address this gap, serum samples were collected from 24 female patients with SZ and 25 healthy controls. The metabolic profiling was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to capture abroad range of metabolites. Our results revealed that BDNF is not a robust discriminatory biomarker. Marked differences in metabolic profiles were identified between patients with SZ and healthy individuals. The GC-MS analysis revealed significant differences in 79 metabolites; while the LC-MS analysis identified 419 significantly differential metabolites. Functional analysis reveals that these differential metabolites predominantly contribute to metabolic and neuro-related processes. Our findings demonstrate that norepinephrine and melatonin, two additional neuroendocrine compounds, are significantly elevated in patients with SZ compared to healthy controls. Notably, their higher areas under the curve (AUC) values compared to BDNF highlight their potential as more reliable biomarkers for SZ. This study offers valuable insights into the altered metabolic patterns of female patients with SZ and establishes melatonin and norepinephrine as promising neuroendocrine biomarkers, underscoring their diagnostic value and role in the neuroendocrine regulation of mental disorders.",

        "title": "Dysregulation of Noradrenergic Activity: Its Role in Conceptualizing and Treating Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia, Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.",
        "abstract": "When discussing neurotransmitters whose signaling plays an important role in psychiatric illnesses, serotonin and dopamine may be the first that come to mind. Although serotonin and dopamine have significant roles, the impact of norepinephrine signaling is often overlooked. A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperactivity of norepinephrine signaling is an underlying issue in psychiatric disorders; conversely, there is evidence to suggest that deficits in the noradrenergic system are just as significant. Hence, alterations in noradrenergic activity are better characterized as dysregulation rather than a reductive, outdated formulation of \"too much\" or \"too little\" activity. Therefore, symptoms such as agitation, irritability, hyperarousal, and insomnia could be treated by targeting the underlying pathophysiology related to noradrenergic dysregulation with targeted treatments. In a recent consensus panel meeting, 5 experts reviewed the available evidence of altered noradrenergic activity and its potential role in some of the most common psychiatric disorders. This Academic Highlights article summarizes their discussion and presents the panel's conclusions.",

        "abstract": "The pathophysiology behind negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia is not well understood, thus limiting the effectiveness of treatment on these symptoms. Developing reliable animal model of schizophrenia is vital to advance our understanding on the neurobiological basis of the disorder. Double hit is used to refer to the use of two schizophrenia inducing interventions viz ketamine exposure and social isolation. In this study we aim to investigate the robustness of double hit model of schizophrenia in inducing negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. On postnatal day (PND) 23, thirty-two male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly grouped into four equal groups as follows: group housed + saline (GH), group housed + ketamine (GHK), isolated + saline (SI), and isolated + ketamine (SIK). A single ketamine dose (16\u202fmg/kg) was administered 3 times a week for four weeks. Isolated animals were housed singly throughout the study. The following behavioural tests were carried out: elevated plus maze, three chamber social interaction, resident intruder tests, and novel object recognition (NOR). The SIK group exhibited high anxiety levels, with increased ACTH, corticosterone and norepinephrine concentration when compared to the other groups. The SIK animals also presented with reduced social interaction and decreased oxytocin concentration. SIK rats were more aggressive towards a juvenile intruder but had low testosterone concentration. The SIK group or double hit model showed impaired visual learning and memory and increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This suggest that the double hit model is more robust in inducing negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia than each treatment alone.",

        "abstract": "Norepinephrine transporter inhibitors that can alter the level of neurotransmitter in the brain are used to treat neurological disorders. However, a number of studies have reported their limited significance as a result of their slow onset of action and moderate efficacy. To determine the effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), reboxetine and atomoxetine on schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Relevant articles published between 2000 and 2022 were searched in the MEDLINE, CINAHL (via Ebsco), Web of Science and Scopus databases. Among the various NRIs, studies concerning the 2 potent drugs - reboxetine and atomoxetine - were selected for analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated, along with the exploration of heterogeneity and publication bias, using RevMan software. A total of 14 eligible studies with a combined sample size of 970 patients were included. Using a random effects model, an OR of 0.55 (0.32-0.94), a Tau2 value of 0.23, a \u00f72 value of 12.31, 8 degrees of freedom (df), an I2 of 35%, a Z value of 2.19, and a p-value of 0.03 were recorded for reboxetine. Atomoxetine had an OR of 0.35 (0.13-0.97), a Tau2 value of 0.58, a \u00f72 value of 7.31, 4 df, an I2 of 45%, a Z value of 1.53, and a p-value of 0.04. All results were statistically significant with a low risk of publication bias, as was evident from the p-values >0.05 derived from the Egger's test and the Begg's test. These drugs provided comparable changes to control drugs in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and ADHD ratings. This confirms the efficacy of reboxetine for the treatment of schizophrenia and atomoxetine for the treatment of ADHD. The present meta-analysis suggests that NRIs are efficacious and therefore they are potential candidate drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia and ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Norepinephrine has both central and peripheral origins and is known to influence cognitive processes in attention, learning, and working memory, but the research regarding the impact of norepinephrine on cognition in schizophrenia remains sparse, and mainly focuses on centrally regulated noradrenergic effects. This study examined the relationship between cumulative overnight norepinephrine levels in the urine and working memory in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Urinary catecholamines were collected overnight in patients with schizophrenia (n\u00a0=\u00a075) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a033). Working memory was assessed using the digit sequencing task. Patients showed significantly higher average levels of overnight norepinephrine (t(103.10)\u00a0=\u00a0-3.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and reduced working memory performance (t(90)\u00a0=\u00a03.87, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) compared with healthy individuals. There was a significant negative correlation between norepinephrine and working memory in patients (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.38, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but not in controls (r\u00a0=\u00a00.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.67). After controlling for age, sex, antipsychotic medications, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor-based antidepressants, the correlation remained significant (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). High peripheral overnight levels of urinary norepinephrine are associated with lower working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia. These results parallel previous studies suggesting that high levels of central norepinephrine may result in working memory impairments. As norepinephrine rapidly breaks down and usually does not pass through the blood-brain barrier, the potential effect of peripheral cumulative norepinephrine on working memory is intriguing, and needs to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "Several lines of evidence have suggested for decades a role for norepinephrine (NE) in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. Recent experimental findings reveal anatomical and physiological properties of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system and its involvement in brain function and cognition. Here, we integrate these two lines of evidence. First, we review the functional and structural properties of the LC-NE system and its impact on functional brain networks, cognition, and stress, with special emphasis on recent experimental and theoretical advances. Subsequently, we present an update about the role of LC-associated functions for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, focusing on the cognitive and motivational deficits. We propose that schizophrenia phenomenology, in particular cognitive symptoms, may be explained by an abnormal interaction between genetic susceptibility and stress-initiated LC-NE dysfunction. This in turn, leads to imbalance between LC activity modes, dysfunctional regulation of brain network integration and neural gain, and deficits in cognitive functions. Finally, we suggest how recent development of experimental approaches can be used to characterize LC function in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness which is characterised by positive and negative symptoms and by cognitive impairments. While the major prevailing hypothesis is that altered dopaminergic and/or glutamatergic transmission contributes to this disease, there is evidence that the noradrenergic system also plays a role in its major symptoms. In the present paper, we investigated the pro-cognitive effect of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) an endogenous neuroprotective compound, on ketamine-modelled schizophrenia in rats. We used an antagonist of NMDA receptors (ketamine) to model memory deficit symptoms in rats. Using the novel object recognition (NOR) test, we investigated the pro-cognitive effect of 1MeTIQ. Additionally, olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, was used as a standard to compare the pro-cognitive effects of the substances. In vivo microdialysis studies allowed us to verify the changes in the release of monoamines and their metabolites in the rat striatum. Our study demonstrated that 1MeTIQ, similarly to olanzapine, exhibits a pro-cognitive effect in NOR test and enhances memory disturbed by ketamine treatment. Additionally, in vivo microdialysis studies have shown that ketamine powerfully increased noradrenaline release in the rat striatum, while 1MeTIQ and olanzapine completely antagonised this neurochemical effect. 1MeTIQ, as a possible pro-cognitive drug, in contrast to olanzapine, expresses beneficial neuroprotective activity in the brain, increasing concentration of the extraneuronal dopamine metabolite, 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), which plays an important physiological role in the brain as an inhibitory regulator of catecholaminergic activity. Moreover, we first demonstrated the essential role of noradrenaline release in memory disturbances observed in the ketamine-model of schizophrenia, and its possible participation in negative symptoms of the schizophrenia.",

Cariprazine reverses the behavioral effects observed in the rat phencyclidine (PCP)-induced model of schizophrenia; however, little is known about its in vivo neurochemistry. The study aims to compare the effects of cariprazine and aripiprazole on PCP-induced changes in the extracellular levels of glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and GABA in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and on locomotor activation. Microdialysis was performed in awake rats with probes placed into the mPFC. Rats (n\u2009=\u20097/group) received vehicle (saline), cariprazine (0.05, 0.2, or 0.8\u00a0mg/kg), or aripiprazole (3 or 20\u00a0mg/kg) via gavage. After 60\u00a0min, 5\u00a0mg/kg PCP was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Samples were taken before drug administration, during pretreatment, and after PCP injection. Locomotor activity recording and microdialysis sampling occurred simultaneously. PCP treatment increased extracellular levels of all the neurotransmitters tested except GABA, for which there were no significant changes. Cariprazine and aripiprazole dose-dependently inhibited the PCP-induced increases of tested neurotransmitters. Overall effects were significant for higher cariprazine doses and both aripiprazole doses for glutamate and noradrenaline, for higher cariprazine doses and 20\u00a0mg/kg aripiprazole for dopamine, and for 0.8\u00a0mg/kg cariprazine and 20\u00a0mg/kg aripiprazole for serotonin and locomotor activity. Both cariprazine and aripiprazole dose-dependently attenuated PCP-induced hyperlocomotion and acute increases in glutamate, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin levels in the mPFC; cariprazine was approximately 5-fold more potent than aripiprazole.",

        "abstract": "Despite substantial research carried out over the last decades, it remains difficult to understand the wide range of pharmacological effects of dopaminergic agents. The dopaminergic system is involved in several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. This complex system features multiple pathways implicated in emotion and cognition, psychomotor functions and endocrine control through activation of G protein-coupled dopamine receptors. This review focuses on the system-wide effects of dopaminergic agents on the multiple biochemical and endocrine pathways, in particular the biomarkers (i.e., indicators of a pharmacological process) that reflect these effects. Dopaminergic treatments developed over the last decades were found to be associated with numerous biochemical pathways in the brain, including the norepinephrine and the kynurenine pathway. Additionally, they have shown to affect peripheral systems, for example the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Dopaminergic agents thus have a complex and broad pharmacological profile, rendering drug development challenging. Considering the complex system-wide pharmacological profile of dopaminergic agents, this review underlines the needs for systems pharmacology studies that include: i) proteomics and metabolomics analysis; ii) longitudinal data evaluation and mathematical modeling; iii) pharmacokinetics-based interpretation of drug effects; iv) simultaneous biomarker evaluation in the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma; and v) specific attention to condition-dependent (e.g., disease) pharmacology. Such approach is considered essential to increase our understanding of central nervous system (CNS) drug effects and substantially improve CNS drug development.",

We have tested whether impaired insulin homeostasis is also present in first-episode patients with major depression (MD) and if this can be discerned from stress-related and medication effects. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined in a cross-sectional cohort study of acute first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with MD (n\u2009=\u200918) or Sz (n\u2009=\u200924), and healthy controls (C, n\u2009=\u200943). Morning cortisol and catecholamine metabolites were assessed to control for hormonal stress axis activation. Subjects were matched for sex, age, body mass index and waist-hip ratio to exclude the possibility that overweight and visceral adiposity were potential confounding factors. HOMA-IR did not differ between MD and controls, but was increased in Sz compared to MD (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and controls (p\u2009=\u20090.012). Catecholamine metabolites were elevated in both patient groups, indicating presence of hormonal stress axis activation. However, diagnosis-related changes of HOMA-IR were independent from this. Impaired insulin sensitivity was absent in MD, but specifically related to the early disease course of Sz. Thus, considering previous studies in this field, MD may be related to impaired glucose/insulin homeostasis in the long-term but not in early disease stages.",

Since then, considerable attention has focused on the interaction between dopamine and 5-HT and it is now well accepted that most antipsychotics (especially the second-generation drugs) modulate both dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. However, the vast majority of research has focused on the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. In the present paper, we review the literature pertaining to the 5-HT3 receptor, the only ionotropic 5-HT receptor. We discuss both the interactions between 5-HT3 receptors and dopamine, and the animal and human literature investigating the role of 5-HT3 receptors in schizophrenia. The results show that the interactions between 5-HT3 receptors and dopamine are complex, but that 5-HT3 receptors do not have a strong influence on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, when added to standard antipsychotic medication, several recent studies have found that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists can induce a statistically significantly improvement in negative and cognitive symptoms. The implications of these findings in relation to animal modelling and drug development are discussed.",

Little is known about the neurochemical basis of probabilistic reasoning. We tested the hypothesis that catecholamines influence data gathering and probabilistic reasoning by administering intravenous methamphetamine, which is known to cause synaptic release of the catecholamines noradrenaline and dopamine, to healthy humans whilst they undertook a probabilistic inference task. Our study used a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. Seventeen healthy volunteers on three visits were administered either placebo or methamphetamine or methamphetamine preceded by amisulpride. In all three conditions participants performed the \"beads\" task in which participants decide how much information to gather before making a probabilistic inference, and which measures the cognitive bias towards jumping to conclusions. Psychotic symptoms triggered by methamphetamine were assessed using Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS). Methamphetamine induced mild psychotic symptoms, but there was no effect of drug administration on the number of draws to decision (DTD) on the beads task. DTD was a stable trait that was highly correlated within subjects across visits (intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.91 on two versions of the task). The less information was sampled in the placebo condition, the more psychotic-like symptoms the person had after the methamphetamine plus amisulpride condition (p\u200a=\u200a0.028). Our results suggest that information gathering during probabilistic reasoning is a stable trait, not easily modified by dopaminergic or noradrenergic modulation.",

        "abstract": "A number of hypotheses have been put forth regarding the etiology of schizophrenia, including the dopamine hypothesis, NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis, and others. A lesser known theory is that elevated noradrenergic signaling plays a causative role in the disease. This paper briefly re-examines the merits of this hypothesis, including as it relates to some recently published studies. Several lines of evidence are investigated, including: endogenous level studies of norepinephrine (NE); modulation of the disease by noradrenergic drugs; association of the disease with bipolar disorder and hypertension, since these latter two conditions may involve elevated NE transmission; and effects of psychological stress on the disease, since stress can produce elevated release of NE. For many of these lines of evidence, their relationship with prepulse inhibition of startle is examined. A number of these studies support the hypothesis, and several suggest that elevated NE signaling plays a particularly prominent role in the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia. If the hypothesis is correct for some persons, conventional pharmaceutical treatment options, such as use of atypical antipsychotics (which may themselves modulate noradrenergic signaling), may be improved if selective NE transmission modulating agents are added to or even substituted for these conventional drugs.",

Although it is generally assumed that these changes reflect targeted disruption of embryonic neurogenesis, it is unknown whether these effects generalise to other antimitotic agents administered at different stages of development. In the present study, neurochemical, behavioral and electrophysiological techniques were used to determine whether exposure to the antimitotic agent Ara-C later in development recapitulates some of the changes observed in methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-treated animals and in patients with schizophrenia. Male rats exposed to Ara-C (30\u2003mg/kg/day) at embryonic days 19.5 and 20.5 show reduced cell numbers and heterotopias in hippocampal CA1 and CA2/3 regions, respectively, as well as cell loss in the superficial layers of the pre- and infralimbic cortex. Birth date labeling with bromodeoxyuridine reveals that the cytoarchitectural changes in CA2/3 are a consequence rather that a direct result of disrupted cortical neurogenesis. Ara-C-treated rats possess elevated levels of cortical dopamine and DOPAC (3,4-didyhydroxypheylacetic acid) but no change in norepinephrine or serotonin. Ara-C-treated rats are impaired in their ability to learn the Morris water maze task and showed diminished synaptic plasticity in the hippocampocortical pathway. These data indicate that disruption of neurogenesis at embryonic days 19.5 and 20.5 constitutes a useful model for the comparative study of deficits observed in other gestational models and their relationship to cognitive changes observed in schizophrenia.",

Repeated LPS (1 mg/kg) injection in rats, that had started from 7th day of pregnancy and was continued every second day till delivery, resulted in a long-lasting disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) and elevation of locomotor activity in their offspring. The prenatally LPS-treated rats showed hypersensitivity to MK-801 (0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg) as evidenced by the enhancement of acoustic startle amplitude, reduced PPI, and enhanced locomotor activity. These behavioral changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dopamine and its metabolite, DOPAC concentration in the frontal cortex, enhanced dopaminergic system activity in the striatum and no changes in noradrenaline (NA) level. Furthermore, the significant augmentation of 5-HT and 5-HIAA content in the frontal cortex of females only was detected. No changes in the cortical NA tissue level were found. Summing up, the present study demonstrated that the activation of the immune system in prenatal period led to persistent behavioral hypersensitivity to psychotomimetic action of a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, and attention/information processing deficits. The foregoing data indicate that prenatal administration of LPS model some of the clinical aspects of schizophrenia and these behavioral effects are connected with neurochemical changes.",

The results showed lower level of plasma 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in relapsed versus first-episode schizophrenic patients, higher norepinephrine (NE) turnover rate (TR) in undifferentiated in comparison to paranoid schizophrenic patients and relatively higher metabolic activity of dopamine (DA) to serotonin (5-HT) in first-episode versus relapsed schizophrenic patients.

        "abstract": "The superior efficacy of atypical vs. classical antipsychotic drugs to treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia appears related to their ability to enhance mesocortical dopamine (DA) function. Given that noradrenergic (NE) transmission contributes to cortical DA output, we assessed the ability of NE-targeting drugs to modulate DA release in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), with the aim of selectively increasing mesocortical DA. Extracellular DA was measured using brain microdialysis in rat mPFC and NAc after local/systemic drug administration, electrical stimulation and selective brain lesions. Local GBR12909 [a selective DA transporter (DAT) inhibitor] administration increased DA output more in NAc than in mPFC whereas reboxetine [a selective NE transporter (NET) inhibitor] had an opposite regional profile. DA levels increased comparably in both regions of control rats after local nomifensine (DAT+NET inhibitor) infusion, but this effect was much lower in PFC of NE-lesioned rats (DSP-4) and in NAc of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus preferentially enhanced DA output in mPFC. Consistently, the administration of reboxetine+RX821002 (an \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist) dramatically enhanced DA output in mPFC (but not NAc). This effect also occurred when reboxetine+RX821002 were co-administered with haloperidol or clozapine. The preferential contribution of the NE system to PFC DA allows selective enhancement of DA transmission by simultaneously blocking NET and \u03b12-adrenoceptors, thus preventing the autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback on NE activity. Our results highlight the importance of NET and \u03b12-adrenoceptors as targets for treating negative/cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders.",

        "title": "Dexamphetamine-induced reduction of P3a and P3b in healthy participants.",
        "abstract": "The reduced P3 is one of the most robust deficits involved in schizophrenia. Previous research with catecholaminergic agonists or releasers such as amphetamines have used doses too small to adequately demonstrate an effect on P3. In this study, we gave 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine to healthy volunteers (final n = 18) using both auditory and visual three-stimulus P3 procedures. Dexamphetamine significantly reduced P3 amplitudes to auditory target, rare non-target and standard stimulus amplitudes. The reduction in auditory P3 induced by dexamphetamine was proportional across stimulus types to placebo P3 values. There were no effects of dexamphetamine on visual P3. We demonstrate a reduced auditory P3 similar to that seen in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. This possibly reflects a common pathology which is hypothesized within the P3 literature to be related to attention and working memory. Differences between auditory and visual P3 modulation may be related to regional variations in catecholamine or specifically dopamine receptor densities. One specific auditory P3 generator is the superior temporal cortex, an area with dopamine D(2) receptor enriched bands. This is contrasted with visual specific generators, such as the inferior temporal cortex and superior parietal cortex, which do not have these enriched bands.",

        "title": "Impaired neuroendocrine and immune response to acute stress in medication-naive patients with a first episode of psychosis.",
        "abstract": "Little is known about how the biological stress response systems--the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the immune system--function during psychosis. Results of studies on the effect of stress on the immune and autonomic system in patients with schizophrenia are inconsistent. The present study investigates whether the stress response is impaired in medication-naive patients with a first episode of psychosis. Ten male patients with a first episode of psychosis and 15 controls were exposed to the stress of public speaking. Parameters of the ANS (heart rate and catecholamines), the HPA axis (plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] and cortisol), and the immune system (number and activity of natural killer [NK] cells) were measured. Peak responses were calculated to examine the relationship between stress-induced activation of the different systems. Subjective stress and anxiety before and during the task were assessed. Patients and controls displayed similar autonomic responses to acute stress. However, there was an impaired HPA axis response, slow onset and return of ACTH, and flattened cortisol response and a reduced increase in number NK cells and NK cell activity in patients with a first episode of psychosis. Furthermore, in patients, the relationship between the different stress response systems was weaker or absent compared with controls. These findings indicate that impairments in stress processing are associated with the endophenotype of psychosis and are not a result of illness progression or antipsychotic medication.",

        "title": "The novel neurotensin analog NT69L blocks phencyclidine (PCP)-induced increases in locomotor activity and PCP-induced increases in monoamine and amino acids levels in the medial prefrontal cortex.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a life-long, severe, and disabling brain disorder that requires chronic pharmacotherapy. Because current antipsychotic drugs do not provide optimal therapy, we have been developing novel treatments that focus on receptors for the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT). NT69L, an analog of neurotensin(8-13), acts like an atypical antipsychotic drug in several dopamine-based animal models used to study schizophrenia. Another current animal model utilizes non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA/glutamate receptor, such as the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP). In the present study, we investigated the effects of NT69L on PCP-induced behavioral and biochemical changes in the rat. The top of an activity chamber was modified to allow us to perform microdialysis in rat brain, while simultaneously recording the locomotor activity of a rat. PCP injection significantly increased activity as well as the extracellular concentration of norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT, dopamine (DA), and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pretreating with NT69L blocked the PCP-induced hyperactivity as well as the increase of DA, 5-HT, NE, and glutamate in mPFC. Interestingly and unexpectedly, NT69L markedly increased glycine levels, while PCP was without effect on glycine levels. Thus, NT69L showed antipsychotic-like effects in this glutamate-based animal model for studying schizophrenia. Previous work from our group suggests that NT69L also has antipsychotic-like effects in dopaminergic and serotonergic rodent models. Taken together, these data suggest that NT69L in particular and NT receptor agonists in general, will be useful as broad-spectrum antipsychotic drugs.",

        "title": "Associations between plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and negative symptoms or cognitive impairments in early-stage schizophrenia.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenic patients demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits, including attention, executive functions, and working memory, even in the early stage of disease. In the present study, we examined the association between blood levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in patients with early-stage schizophrenia. We also investigated the association between frontal GABA levels using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3T and scores on the WCST in the same patients. Blood levels of BDNF and catecholamine metabolites and brain GABA levels using 1H-MRS were measured in 18 schizophrenic patients (nine males, nine females; age range 13-52 year). A significantly positive correlation was observed between plasma MHPG levels and %PEM (rho = -0.686, p = 0.0047). A trend toward negative correlation was found between frontal lobe GABA levels and the per cent of preservation error (%PEM) in the early stage of schizophrenia (rho = -0.420, p = 0.0836). These results suggest that noradrenergic neurons might be involved in neuropsychological functions in early-stage of schizophrenia.",

        "title": "Improving antidepressant drugs: update on recently patented compounds.",
        "abstract": "According to the WHO, depression is a common condition that affects about 121 million people worldwide. Although the pathophysiological origin of this condition is still unknown, most of the known antidepressants enhance the extracellular availability of brain monoamines (serotonin and/or noradrenaline). We have searched for the potential drugs and targets addressed in the most recent patents. Hence, we have explored the Patent Database of the European Patent Office using the esp@cenet search engine for the period 2005 - 2008, looking for \"anti depressants\". In addition, a search in the Medtrack database yielded information on pharmaceutical companies developing compounds as antidepressants, market size and their market prospects. We have found that, in general, the preferred targets to develop antidepressants continue to be those aiming the serotoninergic system and, in a less extend, the noradrenergic one; but, more particularly, those that aim several targets are preferred due to problems concerning the efficacy of highly selective drugs. Additionally, a small number of new systems are being targeted, such as the melatonergic. However, when looking at the pharma-market and the antidepressants in the pipeline, a new trend is observed in the developing of dual-action drugs that could be used in depression and schizophrenia therapy.",
