        "abstract": "We aimed to compare neuropeptide levels between patients with major psychiatric disorders and healthy controls and examine their association with symptoms and cognitive function. The participants were 149 patients with schizophrenia, 115 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 186 unremitted patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 350 healthy controls. Psychiatric (schizophrenic, manic, and depressive) symptoms, sleep state, and cognitive (premorbid intelligence quotient, general cognitive, and memory) functions were evaluated. A multiplex immunoassay kit was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels. The verification assay revealed that CSF \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were too low to be reliably measured, while plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels could be successfully measured. Plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and healthy controls. Plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and cognitive function scores in patients or healthy controls. Our data suggest that plasma neuropeptide levels do not elucidate the involvement of neuropeptides in the pathology of schizophrenia, BD, or MDD.",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges in suicide prevention is the limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying suicide. Recent findings suggest impairments in pain processing in acutely suicidal patients. However, little is known about the biological factors that may drive these discrete physiological abnormalities. In this study, we examined plasma peptides involved in analgesic and inflammatory responses and physical pain threshold in acutely suicidal patients. Thirty-seven depressed patients of both sexes hospitalized for severe suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt were characterized clinically including history of suicidal ideation and behavior. Psychological and physical pain, and pressure pain threshold was also measured. Plasma levels of \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, agouti-related protein (AgRP), C-reactive protein (CRP), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were run in Milliplex multiplex assays. The number of lifetime suicide attempts was positively correlated with \u03b2-endorphin (r\u202f=\u202f0.702; p\u202f=\u202f0.007), and neurotensin (r\u202f=\u202f0.728, p\u202f=\u202f0.007) plasma levels. Higher pain threshold was measured in the suicide attempt group as compared to the suicidal ideation group. Pain threshold was strongly and negatively associated with CRP plasma levels (r\u202f=\u202f-0.548; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). In patients reporting chronic pain, lower AgRP levels and lower pain threshold were observed (t\u202f=\u202f4.472; p\u202f=\u202f0.001). Our results suggest that abnormalities in the opioid and neurotensin systems may underlie the increase in pain threshold found in suicide attempters, and possibly risk for suicidal behavior. Targeting pain circuits and systems may provide therapeutic mechanisms for suicide prevention.",

        "abstract": "Activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) and the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) and aberrations in endogenous opioids play a role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). There are no studies which examined the associations between both systems in MDD. The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between \u03b2-Endorphin (\u03b2-EP), Endomorphin-2, and their mu-opioid receptor (MOR) as well as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in MDD patients. The study included 60 depressed drug-free male patients and 30 matched controls. Serum \u03b2-EP, Endomorphin-2, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were measured using ELISA techniques. The results revealed a significant increase in serum \u03b2-EP, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 in MDD patients versus healthy controls. MOR levels were strongly associated with IL-10 levels. There were no significant correlations between endogenous opioids and IL-6 and IL-10. The results show that MOR levels may function as a possible component of the CIRS whilst there is no evidence that \u03b2-EP and EM-2 may modify the IRS. The significant correlation between MOR levels and IL-10 may be explained through central activation of the HPA-axis and increased B-cell numbers expressing MOR as a response to cytokine over-secretion in MDD.",

This review examines some of the best-characterized molecular and clinical risk factors for PPD. We illustrate that this is a growing literature but there remains a lack of reliable molecular predictors for PPD. Current best predictors are clinical assessments for psychiatric history and adverse life events, highlighting the need for increased depression screening across the perinatal period.",

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis measures were assessed at rest and during mental stress, as well as sensitivity to cold pressor and tourniquet ischemic pain tasks in four groups of women: (1) non-PMDD with no prior MDD (N=18); (2) non-PMDD with prior MDD (N=9); (3) PMDD with no prior MDD (N=17); (4) PMDD with prior MDD (N=10). PMDD women showed blunted SNS responses to stress compared to non-PMDD women, irrespective of prior MDD; while women with prior MDD showed exaggerated diastolic blood pressure responses to stress versus never depressed women, irrespective of PMDD. However, only in women with histories of MDD did PMDD women have lower cortisol concentrations than non-PMDD women, and only in non-PMDD women was MDD associated with reduced cold pressor pain sensitivity. These results suggest both unique phenotypic differences between women with PMDD and those with a history of MDD, but also indicate that histories of MDD may have special relevance for PMDD.",

        "abstract": "After delivery, many women experience symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), and early identification of women at risk is therefore important. The opioid peptide beta-endorphin has been implicated in non-puerperal depression but its role in the development of PPD is unknown. Three hundred and seven women with a singleton, full-term (>37.0 weeks' GA) pregnancy were recruited early in pregnancy and followed up into the postpartum period. Blood samples were obtained at 15, 19, 25, 31 and 37 weeks' gestational age (GA) and at 9 weeks postpartum for assessment of beta-endorphin. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale at the last four pregnancy visits and with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale postpartum. Among women who were euthymic at 25 weeks' GA, those who proceeded to develop PPD symptoms had higher levels of beta-endorphin throughout pregnancy compared to women without PPD symptoms (all t>2.11, p<.05). At each assessment, women above the cut-off score for beta-endorphin were at more than three-fold risk for PPD symptoms (odds ratios 3.19-4.68) compared to women below the cut-off score. Self-report of depressive symptoms, no mental health history. Beta-endorphin may be a useful early predictor of PPD symptoms in women who do not report depressive symptoms in mid-pregnancy. If replicated, these findings have clinical implications for the identification and treatment of this at-risk group and further suggest that some of the pathways leading to this complex disorder may be specific to subgroups of women.",

        "title": "The role of beta-endorphin in the pathophysiology of major depression.",
        "abstract": "A role for beta-endorphin (beta-END) in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is suggested by both animal research and studies examining clinical populations. The major etiological theories of depression include brain regions and neural systems that interact with opioid systems and beta-END. Recent preclinical data have demonstrated multiple roles for beta-END in the regulation of complex homeostatic and behavioural processes that are affected during a depressive episode. Additionally, beta-END inputs to regulatory pathways involving feeding behaviours, motivation, and specific types of motor activity have important implications in defining the biological foundations for specific depressive symptoms. Early research linking beta-END to MDD did so in the context of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, where it was suggested that HPA axis dysregulation may account for depressive symptoms in some individuals. The primary aims of this paper are to use both preclinical and clinical research (a) to critically review data that explores potential roles for beta-END in the pathophysiology of MDD and (b) to highlight gaps in the literature that limit further development of etiological theories of depression and testable hypotheses. In addition to examining methodological and theoretical challenges of past clinical studies, we summarize studies that have investigated basal beta-END levels in MDD and that have used challenge tests to examine beta-END responses to a variety of experimental paradigms. A brief description of the synthesis, location in the CNS and behavioural pharmacology of this neuropeptide is also provided to frame this discussion. Given the lack of clinical improvement observed with currently available antidepressants in a significant proportion of depressed individuals, it is imperative that novel mechanisms be investigated for antidepressant potential. We conclude that the renewed interest in elucidating the role of beta-END in the pathophysiology of MDD must be paralleled by consensus building within the research community around the heterogeneity inherent in mood disorders, standardization of experimental protocols, improved discrimination of POMC products in analytical techniques and consistent attention paid to important confounds like age and gender.",

Activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors has been shown to increase plasma beta-endorphin (beta-END) levels in animal studies and in healthy humans. To assess interaction abnormalities between 5-HT1A receptors and the endogenous opioid system in patients with major depression and the possible modulating effect of citalopram. The beta-END response to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone (30 mg), was measured in 30 patients with major depression and in 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls before and after an 8-week treatment with citalopram. Pre-treatment score of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was >or=17. Antidepressant response was defined by a 50% decrease in the HRSD. Pre- and post-treatment maximum peak response (Deltamax) and the area under the curve (AUC) of beta-END response were compared. Three time points were measured (60, 90 and 120 min). We also examined the correlations between the beta-END response and the antidepressant response. Buspirone plasma levels were not measured. At baseline, beta-END response was similar in patients and controls. After 8 weeks of citalopram treatment depressed patients showed a significant decrease in the beta-END response (Deltamax: p<.001; AUC: p<.001). A significant correlation between the beta-END reduction in the response and the reduction in the HRSD score (r=.656; p<.001) was observed. Changes in interaction between 5-HT1A receptor system and the endogenous opioid system may play a role both in the mechanism of action and response to antidepressant drugs.",

        "title": "Adapted cold shower as a potential treatment for depression.",
        "abstract": "Depression is a debilitating mood disorder that is among the top causes of disability worldwide. It can be characterized by a set of somatic, emotional, and behavioral symptoms, one of which is a high risk of suicide. This work presents a hypothesis that depression may be caused by the convergence of two factors: (A) A lifestyle that lacks certain physiological stressors that have been experienced by primates through millions of years of evolution, such as brief changes in body temperature (e.g. cold swim), and this lack of \"thermal exercise\" may cause inadequate functioning of the brain. (B) Genetic makeup that predisposes an individual to be affected by the above condition more seriously than other people. To test the hypothesis, an approach to treating depression is proposed that consists of adapted cold showers (20 degrees C, 2-3 min, preceded by a 5-min gradual adaptation to make the procedure less shocking) performed once or twice daily. The proposed duration of treatment is several weeks to several months. The following evidence appears to support the hypothesis: Exposure to cold is known to activate the sympathetic nervous system and increase the blood level of beta-endorphin and noradrenaline and to increase synaptic release of noradrenaline in the brain as well. Additionally, due to the high density of cold receptors in the skin, a cold shower is expected to send an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain, which could result in an anti-depressive effect. Practical testing by a statistically insignificant number of people, who did not have sufficient symptoms to be diagnosed with depression, showed that the cold hydrotherapy can relieve depressive symptoms rather effectively. The therapy was also found to have a significant analgesic effect and it does not appear to have noticeable side effects or cause dependence. In conclusion, wider and more rigorous studies would be needed to test the validity of the hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Psychological, endocrine and immune parameters were measured over a 6-month period in 14 healthy subjects who underwent an unpredictable acute emotional stress (e.g. sudden death of a loved one) compared with 14 controls who did not. Probands were profoundly stressed as assessed 10 days after bereavement by their scores on the Hamilton Rating Scales of Anxiety and Depression, adrenocorticotropin and cortisol plasma concentrations, and non-suppression in response to dexamethasone. Functional alterations of immune parameters, such as responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens, were found 40 days after bereavement. Despite a normal number of circulating lymphocyte subsets, the functional activity of natural killer (NK) cells was markedly reduced at day 40. Changes in the intracellular concentration of beta-endorphin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlated with anxiety and depression scores. Controls showed no changes in psychometric, endocrine and immune measures during the 6-month study. Cluster analysis revealed two groups of bereaved subjects with different patterns of immune and endocrine changes: (1) Five subjects, characterized by harm-avoidant temperament and long-lasting dysphoric mood, showed reduced responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens, decreased NK cell activity and non-suppression in response to dexamethasone that persisted for 6 months. (2) Nine subjects showed significant changes only during the early phase after bereavement. Our data suggest that the immunological consequences of stress do not simply overlap with psychological and endocrine alterations, and are particularly severe and long-lasting in a subgroup of subjects, indicating the importance of individual variability in the capacity to cope with stress.",

A polyclonal antiserum against beta-endorphin was employed for the immunohistochemical detection of the peptide in sections of postmortem human brains. Quantitative analysis revealed that the number of beta-endorphin-containing arcuate neurons was statistically reduced in schizophrenics and depressives in comparison to controls. Moreover, the number of endorphinoceptive (i.e. beta-endorphin-innervated) paraventricular nerve cells was also lower in psychiatric patients than in control cases. Our results showing an altered endorphinergic system in human hypothalami of schizophrenics and depressives might contribute to a renewal of interest in this peptide as a possible factor of importance in psychiatric disorders.",

Major depression prevalence data (annual rate/100) was obtained from the Cross-National Epidemiology of Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder study [Weissman et al., 1996]. Sugar consumption data from 1991 was obtained from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. For the primary analysis, sugar consumption rates (cal/cap/day) were correlated with the annual rate of major depression, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. For the six countries with available data for the primary analysis, there was a highly significant correlation between sugar consumption and the annual rate of depression (Pearson correlation 0.948, P=0.004). Naturally, a correlation does not necessarily imply etiology. Caveats such as the limited number of countries with available data must be considered. Although speculative, there are some mechanistic reasons to consider that sugar consumption may directly impact the prevalence of major depression.

After dexamethasone administration, corticotropin-releasing factor plasma values decreased significantly in the depressed group, but showed no significant changes in the controls. In depressive disorder baseline values correlated significantly for salivary cortisol and plasma cortisol, salivary cortisol and plasma corticotropin-releasing factor and plasma corticotropin and beta-endorphin. Similar correlations were found in the healthy subjects, except for salivary cortisol and plasma corticotropin-releasing factor. These findings indicate that the increased corticotropin-releasing factor plasma concentrations demonstrated in depressive disorder reflect the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor hypersecretion evidenced in this illness.

While other challenges to the HPA axis have used endocrine stimuli such as insulin-induced hypoglycemia, we now report of the response to a social stressor in patients with major depression and matched control subjects. We used the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a public speaking task followed by mental arithmetic challenge in front of a panel of judges. The results suggest that depressed patients manifest normal cortisol response to a social stressor, despite increased pre-stressor plasma cortisol. However, the beta-endorphin response to the TSST was significantly smaller in the depressed patients compared to matched controls. These data are similar to data found with exogenous corticotropin-releasing-hormone challenge studies and suggest that elevated baseline cortisol can modulate the pituitary corticotroph response to a stressor, but that changes in adrenal sensitivity to ACTH result in a robust cortisol response to this stressor.",

Since depressed patients demonstrate higher plasma cortisol concentrations at the time of oCRF challenge, it is difficult to determine if the decreased ACTH response is due to enhanced negative feedback of cortisol on ACTH release or an alteration in CRF receptors in depressed patients. To evaluate the response to oCRF in an \"open feedback loop\" system, we administered metyrapone 750 mg at 4 PM and 7:30 PM, followed by administration of oCRF 0.3 microgram/kg at 8 PM in 10 normal controls and 10 depressed patients. Administration of metyrapone at this time in the circadian rhythm clamped plasma cortisol concentrations to less than 2 micrograms/dl but did not result in rebound ACTH or beta-End secretion in control subjects. In control subjects, metyrapone administration produced a 85% blockade of the cortisol response as well as a 3-fold greater beta-End response compared to administration of the same dose of oCRF without metyrapone. The 10 depressed patients and their matched controls demonstrated identical beta-End responses (integrated response for controls = 291 +/- 61, for patients = 352 +/- 86) and cortisol responses (integrated response for controls = 187 +/- 38, for patients = 206 +/- 52) to oCRF following metyrapone pretreatment.

The results provide evidence that the pathophysiology underlying the abnormal DST+CRH and DST tests in melancholia is localized at the pituitary level and may consist of a CRH-driven breakthrough of corticotropic cell secretion synergized by central and peripheral agents, in conjunction with a decrease in glucocorticoid feedback suppressibility.",

        "title": "Effects of the menstrual cycle on dependent variables in mood disorder research.",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the effects of the menstrual cycle on dependent variables in mood disorder research to inform investigators which physiological measures are likely to be significantly affected by menstrual cycle fluctuations and precisely how they might be affected. The following variables are discussed: prolactin; growth hormone; the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (including thyrotropin, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine); the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol, corticotropin, and beta-endorphin); melatonin; sleep; body temperature; and neurotransmitter activity (serotonergic and adrenergic systems). Body temperature and plasma and urinary norepinephrine vary predictably over the menstrual cycle. Prolactin and beta-endorphin may have peaks in the periovulatory phase, whereas serotonin levels in platelet-poor plasma may reach a nadir at that time. Triiodothyronine, thyroxine, cortisol, and melatonin do not appear to vary systematically over the course of the menstrual cycle, whereas the data for growth hormone, thyrotropin, corticotropin, and sleep are inconclusive.",

        "title": "Increased evening activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in depressed patients.",
        "abstract": "To determine whether depressed patients demonstrate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation during the late afternoon and evening, a time when the HPA axis is usually quiescent in normal subjects. We administered metyrapone, an 11-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor of cortisol synthesis, to normal controls and depressed patients between 4 and 10 PM. Metyrapone blockade of cortisol secretion would amplify any HPA axis secretion. In 10 normal control subjects, administration of metyrapone lowered plasma cortisol levels to a mean of 36 nmol/L. No rebound corticotropin or beta-endorphin secretion was seen in these normal controls between 4 and 10 PM, supporting the existence of a period of minimal endogenous corticotropin releasing factor drive. Compared with a group of placebo-treated depressed patients (n = 10), metyrapone-treated depressed subjects (n = 17) had significantly decreased plasma cortisol concentrations. However, in contrast to normal controls treated with metyrapone, metyrapone-treated depressed patients demonstrated rebound corticotroph secretion, particularly between 7:30 and 10 PM (P = .036 for patients vs normal controls for beta-endorphin secretion from 4:30 to 10 PM). These data support the hypothesis of increased corticotropin releasing factor drive in the evening in depressed subjects and are in agreement with the longstanding observation of \"early escape\" from dexamethasone suppression between 4 and 11 PM in depressed patients.",
