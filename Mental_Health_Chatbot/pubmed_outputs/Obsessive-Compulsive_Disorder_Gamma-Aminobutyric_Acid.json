        "abstract": "The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid complex (Glx)/Cr levels in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy controls' orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) method and to investigate their relationship with oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This study included patients with OCD (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a025) ranging in age from 18 to 65. We used the ELISA method to evaluate serum SOD and GPx levels. Levels of NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus were measured using the 1H-MRS method. Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3\u00a0T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",

In total, 54 patients with OCD and 54 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex were included in the study. They underwent MRS in the pgACC region to calculate the concentrations of Glu, Gln, GABA, and Glu + Gln (Glx). After quality control of the MRS data, 21 OCD and 21 HC were statistically analyzed. The severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale. The results indicate that patients with OCD present a disturbance in glutamatergic metabolism in the pgACC. The results also demonstrate that these changes correlate with the severity of compulsions.",

Within the SMA, trait and clinical measures of compulsive behaviour are related to glutamate levels, whereas a behavioural index of habitual control correlates with the glutamate:GABA ratio. Participants with OCD also show the latter relationship in the ACC while exhibiting elevated glutamate and lower GABA levels in that region. This study highlights SMA mechanisms of habitual control relevant to compulsive behaviour, common to the healthy sub-clinical and OCD populations.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have reported decreases in GABA in cortical brain areas in the NDDs, however, GABA levels in the cerebellum have not been examined. To determine possible group effects, we used a MEGA-PRESS acquisition to investigate GABA+ levels in a cerebellar voxel in 343 individuals (aged 2.5-22\u2009years) with ASD, ADHD, OCD and controls.

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common and disabling psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in an effort to provide a better understanding of the role of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pathophysiology of OCD. We hypothesized that beyond the separate effects of these neurotransmitter systems, a disruption in the balance between GABA and glutamate could be particularly relevant to OCD. We obtained MRS measures of GABA and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex from 23 adult patients with OCD and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy community volunteers. Established clinical rating scales were used to assess the severities of OCD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Statistical analysis involved the assessment of patient-control group differences in the individual measures of GABA and glutamate, as well as in the ratio of the GABA to glutamate measures. Additionally, we explored whether differences in the MRS measures existed between two subgroups of patients formed according to the severity of their OCD symptoms. Finally, we assessed the relations of demographic and clinical variables to the MRS measures. Patients with OCD displayed a higher estimated GABA level and a higher GABA to glutamate ratio than healthy participants, but no significant group differences were observed in the measure of glutamate. The MRS measures did not vary by subgroup and showed no correlations with demographic and clinical variables. These results indicate that GABA abnormalities within the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. The results fail to provide evidence that glutamate abnormalities alone are involved in adult OCD. Yet, it seems that a disruption in the balance between glutamate and GABA neurotransmission may have a particularly important role to play in OCD pathophysiology.",

The AEDs may be effective in the management of (1) chronic pruritus, including pruritus due systemic disease, including uremia, neuropathic pain, neuropathic pruritus, and complex cutaneous sensory syndromes, especially where central nervous system (CNS) sensitization plays a role; (2) management of emotional dysregulation and the resultant repetitive self-excoriation or other cutaneous self-injury in patients who repetitively stimulate or manipulate their integument to regulate emotions (prurigo nodularis, lichen simplex chronicus, skin picking disorder, trichotillomania); (3) management of dermatologic clinical manifestations associated with autonomic nervous system activation (hyperhidrosis, urticaria, flushing; these often occur in conjunction with psychiatric disorders with prominent autonomic activation and dysregulation, eg, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder); and (4) when certain anticonvulsants have a direct therapeutic effect (eg, in psoriasis); currently the use of AEDs for such cases is largely experimental.

While adjuvant memantine to a standard medication with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) appears to reduce OCD symptoms, the adjuvant effect of gabapentin is less certain. The aim of the present randomized, double-blind and three-arm clinical trial was therefore to assess whether, compared to placebo, gabapentin (GAB) or memantine (MEM) adjuvant to a standard medication with an SSRI (fluoxetine; FLU) might lead to further improvements. A total of 99 outpatients (mean age: 29.59 years; 49.5% females) diagnosed with OCD were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: FLU\u00a0+\u00a0gabapentin (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0GAB); FLU\u00a0+\u00a0memantine (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0MEM); FLU\u00a0+\u00a0placebo (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0PLA). Experts rated patients' symptoms of OCD with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline, and 4 and 8 weeks later. YBOCS scores did not decrease over time. No group differences were observed. However, the significant Time by Group interaction showed that Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly over time in the FLU\u00a0+\u00a0PLA group. Response rates did not differ between the three study conditions. Typical side-effects were rash (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0MEM), drowsiness (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0GAB), anxiety (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0GAB; FLU\u00a0+\u00a0PLA), and drowsiness plus anxiety (FLU\u00a0+\u00a0GAB). The present pattern of results suggests that glutamatergic medications such as gabapentin and memantine adjuvant to a standard treatment with an SSRI have no additional positive impact on patients with OCD, as measured with the Y-BOCS. Additionally, side-effects were reported. Future studies should use more fine-grained tools to assess, for example, patients' sleep and cognitive functioning, and patients' view of symptoms.",

Seventeen unmedicated OCD adults received two intravenous infusions at least 1 week apart, one of saline and one of ketamine, while lying supine in a 3.0 T GE MR scanner. The order of each infusion pair was randomized. Levels of GABA and Glx were measured in the MPFC before, during, and after each infusion and normalized to water (W). A mixed effects model found that MPFC GABA/W significantly increased over time in the ketamine compared with the saline infusion. In contrast, there were no significant differences in Glx/W between the ketamine and saline infusions.

Therefore, in this study, a proton MRS imaging (1H MRSI) technique with relatively high spatial resolution at 3.0 T was used to measure minimally contaminated glutamate levels in three striatal subregions (i.e., dorsal caudate, dorsal putamen, and ventral striatum) in 15 unmedicated adults with OCD and 16 matched healthy control subjects. No significant group differences in glutamate levels were found in any of the three striatal subregions. In contrast, a study in unmedicated pediatric OCD patients that measured glutamatergic compounds in the dorsal caudate by MRS at 1.5 T found significant elevations. Further studies are warranted to assess whether these discrepant MRS findings are due to differences in subject age or MRS methodology, or potentially are associated with glutamatergic gene variants implicated in OCD.",

Marble-burying behavior is a pharmacological model for study of OCD. In the present study, we examined the effects of mood stabilizers on marble-burying behavior in mice, as well as the role of GABA receptors in this behavior. The effects of treatment with valproate, carbamazepine, lithium carbonate, lamotrigine, muscimol and baclofen on marble-burying behavior in mice were evaluated. Valproate (10, 30 and 100\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) and carbamazepine (30 and 100\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced marble-burying behavior without affecting total locomotor activity in ICR mice. Lamotrigine (30\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) also significantly reduced marble-burying behavior in ddY mice. On the other hand, lithium carbonate (10, 30 and 100\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) reduced total locomotor activity without affecting marble-burying behavior in ddY mice. The selective GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1\u00a0mg/kg) significantly reduced marble-burying behavior without affecting total locomotor activity, whereas the selective GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (3\u00a0mg/kg) reduced total locomotor activity without affecting marble-burying behavior. Moreover, the selective GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (3\u00a0mg/kg) significantly counteracted the decrease in marble-burying induced by the administration of muscimol (1\u00a0mg/kg) and valproate (100\u00a0mg/kg). These results suggest that GABAergic mechanism is involved in marble-burying behavior, and that valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine reduce marble-burying behavior.

In the MPFC, Glx/W did not differ by diagnostic group (p=0.98) or sex (p=0.57).

On a total of 504 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), phobia, or posttraumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) and 593 controls, investigations of VMAT2, DAT, SERT, D1, D2, 5-HTIA, 5-HT2A, GABA(A), and NK1 receptor binding in neostriatum, ventral striatum, thalamus, neocortex, limbic system, cingulate, midbrain/ pons or cerebellum were performed using either PET or SPECT. Separate analyses of the individual disorders showed significant decreases of striatal D2 receptors in OCD (-18%), mesencephalic SERT in OCD (-13%), frontocortical GABAA receptors in PD (-13%) and temporocortical GABAA receptors in GAD (-16%). Pooling of all disorders yielded a significant reduction of mesencephalic SERT (-13%), mesencephalic (-27%) as well as cingulate 5-HT1A receptors (-18%), striatal D2 receptors (-21%) and frontal (-14%), temporal (-14%), occipital (-13%) and cingulate GABAA receptors (-15%). The results show that DA, 5-HT, and GABA play a major role in all subtypes of anxiety disorders. In particular, the findings imply that the regulation state of DA as modulated by GABA and 5-HT may be crucial for the development of anxiety- and compulsion-related disorders. As GABA and 5-HT inhibit DAergic neurotransmission, the reductions of GABAA, 5-HT1A and SERT can be assumed to result in an enhanced activity of the mesolimbic DAergic system. This notion is also reflected by the decrease of striatal D2 receptor binding, which is indicative of an increased availability of synaptic DA.",

It is also unclear how they might lead to hyperactivity in the OCD circuit. We examined this by investigating the presence of autoantibodies directed against the BG or thalamus in the serum as well as CSF of 23 OCD patients compared with 23 matched psychiatrically normal controls using western blot. We further investigated CSF amino acid (glutamate, GABA, taurine, and glycine) levels and also examined the extent to which these levels were related to the presence of autoantibodies. There was evidence of significantly more binding of CSF autoantibodies to homogenate of BG as well as to homogenate of thalamus among OCD patients compared with controls. There was no significant difference in binding between patient and control sera except for a trend toward more bands to BG and thalamic protein corresponding to 43 kD among OCD patients compared with controls. CSF glutamate and glycine levels were also significantly higher in OCD patients compared with controls, and further multivariate analysis of variance showed that CSF glycine levels were higher in those OCD patients who had autoantibodies compared with those without. The results of our study implicate autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of OCD and also provide preliminary evidence that autoantibodies against BG and thalamus may cause OCD by modulating excitatory neurotransmission.",

        "title": "Pregabalin versus naltrexone in alcohol dependence: a randomised, double-blind, comparison trial.",
        "abstract": "Pregabalin (PRE) acts as a presynaptic inhibitor of the release of excessive levels of excitatory neurotransmitters by selectively binding to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. In this randomised, double-blind comparison trial with naltrexone (NAL), we aimed to investigate the efficacy of PRE on alcohol drinking indices. Craving reduction and improvement of psychiatric symptoms were the secondary endpoints. Seventy-one alcohol-dependent subjects were detoxified and subsequently randomised into two groups, receiving 50 mg of NAL or 150-450 mg of PRE. Craving (VAS; OCDS), withdrawal (CIWA-Ar) and psychiatric symptoms (SCL-90-R) rating scales were applied. Alcohol drinking indices and craving scores were not significantly different between groups. Compared with NAL, PRE resulted in greater improvement of specific symptoms in the areas of anxiety, hostility and psychoticism, and survival function (duration of abstinence from alcohol). PRE also resulted in better outcome in patients reporting a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Results from this study globally place PRE within the same range of efficacy as that of NAL. The mechanism involved in the efficacy of PRE in relapse prevention could be less related to alcohol craving and more associated with the treatment of the comorbid psychiatric symptomatology.",

        "abstract": "Usher syndrome, the most common case of deaf - blindness, may be associated with various psychiatric disorders. Inability of communication through spoken language in association with progressive visual impairment affects diagnostics and management in case of co-morbidity with mental disorder. A patient with Usher syndrome and psychiatric symptoms is described and the difficulties in psychiatric assessment in her case are discussed. A 28 years old woman with hearing impairment diagnosed at the age of 3 months and progressive pigmentary retinopathy diagnosed at the age of 19 years, has been treated for ADHD in childhood, eating disorder in adolescence and psychosis-like disorder in adult life. Direct observation of patient behavior and the effects of pharmacotherapy were the main diagnostic procedures, since the use of sign language and handwriting was very limited. The limitations of management are discussed.",
