        "title": "Glutamate-Based Therapeutic Strategies for Schizophrenia: Emerging Approaches Beyond Dopamine.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder composed of primary cluster-positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganization, neurocognitive deficits, and social cognitive impairments. While traditional antipsychotics primarily target dopamine pathways, they provide limited efficacy against cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Growing evidence implicates glutamatergic dysregulation, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) hypofunction, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, making glutamate modulation a promising therapeutic approach. This review explores emerging glutamate-based treatment strategies, including NMDA receptor modulators, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agents, glutamate transporter regulators, and kynurenine pathway inhibitors. We summarize preclinical and clinical findings on NMDA co-agonists (D-serine and glycine), glycine transporter inhibitors, D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors, and mGluR-targeted therapies, highlighting their mechanisms, efficacy, and limitations. In addition, we discuss novel interventions aimed at restoring glutamate homeostasis, including neuroinflammatory modulation and synaptic plasticity enhancers. Despite promising results, many glutamate-targeting therapies have yielded inconsistent clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and optimized treatment protocols. We propose that integrating glutamate modulators with existing antipsychotic regimens may enhance therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Future research should focus on refining glutamate-based interventions, identifying predictive biomarkers, and addressing the heterogeneity in schizophrenia pathology. With continued advancements, glutamate modulation has the potential to transform schizophrenia treatment, particularly for cognitive and negative symptoms that remain largely unaddressed by current therapies.",

        "abstract": "In schizophrenia, anterior hippocampus (aHipp) overactivity is associated with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) dysfunction, but the contribution to symptomatology is unknown. In rodents, degradation of the hippocampal perineuronal net (PNN) replicates this overactivity, but uncertainty over rodent/human prefrontal homology limits translation to humans. Here, we test the hypothesis that aHipp PNN degradation in a species with a human-like prefrontal cortex, the marmoset, alters aHipp-striatal and aHipp-OFC circuitry. Microdialysis and [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-l-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography identified increased dopamine synthesis in the associative striatum, but not the nucleus accumbens, as is seen in schizophrenia, and elevated dopamine and noradrenaline in the OFC. Behaviorally, activity was elevated in a marmoset version of the amphetamine-induced activity test, and impaired probabilistic discrimination learning was seen in an OFC/striatum-dependent task that computational modeling suggests was due to loss of goal-directed behavior. Together, these findings demonstrate that a loss of primate aHipp PNNs is sufficient to induce striatal and prefrontal dysfunction consistent with that observed in humans with schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research was to characterize changes in peripheral blood neurotransmitter metabolites in olanzapine-treated schizophrenia (SCZ) and to identify potential biomarkers for SCZ. Concurrently, the relationship between these differential neurotransmitters and cognitive function is explored. We recruited 40 SCZ treated with single-agent olanzapine and 40 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive function and psychopathology were assessed using the MCCB and PANSS, respectively. Neurotransmitter levels were determined by targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). SCZ showed cognitive impairment in all domains of the MCCB compared to HC. Interestingly, a 4-neurotransmitter panel consisting of 3-Methoxytyramine hydrochloride (3-MT), 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetate (DOPAC), arginine, and r-aminobutyric acid (GABA) illustrated the highest determinative score between SCZ and HC. Arginine was positively correlated with PANSS general psychopathology scores. 3-MT independently predicted the verbal learning scores only in SCZ, whereas GABA independently predicted the social cognition scores only. Furthermore, GABA independently predicted the working memory scores only in HC. The collective assessment of these four neurotransmitters (3-MT, DOPAC, arginine, and GABA) holds considerable promise as potential biomarkers for SCZ. Moreover, 3-MT and GABA may enhance our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ, particularly in areas of verbal learning and social cognitive dysfunction.",

        "title": "Impact of neuroinflammation on brain glutamate and dopamine signalling in schizophrenia: an update.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Over the years, numerous treatment options have been introduced for schizophrenia. Although they are relatively successful in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, most of the current treatments have a negligible effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms. Thus, none of them could prevent the relapse of psychotic episodes. Among the numerous hypotheses explaining the development and progression of schizophrenia, the cytokine hypothesis explains the role of inflammatory markers as a significant culprit in the development of schizophrenia. Elevated cytokines are reported in animal models and schizophrenic patients. The cytokine hypothesis is based on how increased inflammatory markers can cause changes in the dopaminergic, glutamate, and tryptophan metabolism pathways, like that observed in schizophrenic patients. Reasons, such as autoimmune disease, maternal immune activation, infection, etc., can pave the way for the development of schizophrenia and are associated with the negative, positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is a need to focus on the significance of anti-inflammatory drugs against these symptoms. The development of new treatment strategies in the management of schizophrenia can provide better therapeutic outcomes in terms of the severity of symptoms and treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia. This review attempts to explain the association between elevated inflammatory markers and various neurotransmitters, and the possible use of medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, statins, and estrogens as adjuvant therapy. Over the years, these hypotheses have been the basis for drug discovery for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of dopamine systems has long been considered a hallmark of schizophrenia, and nearly all current first-line medication treatments block dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors. However, approximately a quarter of patients will not adequately respond to these agents and are considered treatment-resistant. Whereas abnormally high striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity has been observed in people with schizophrenia, studies of treatment-resistant patients have not shown this pattern and have even found the opposite - i.e., reductions in striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity. Whether such reductions in fact represent clinical epiphenomena such as medication or other treatment effects or whether they rather represent neurobiological differences related to etiology has been unclear. To understand the dopaminergic implications of genetic liability for treatment-resistant schizophrenia without the confound of clinical epiphenomena, we studied a cohort of healthy individuals without neuropsychiatric illness using [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET) and found that striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity showed an expected direct association with cumulative genetic risk burden for general schizophrenia but an inverse association with specific polygenic risk for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Subsequent evaluation of D<sub>2/3</sub> dopamine receptor availability in an overlapping cohort using [<sup>18</sup>F]-fallypride PET did not identify any effects of genetic risk in the striatum but found an association with treatment-resistant schizophrenia polygenic risk in the thalamus. Overall, these results align with prior PET studies in patients and implicate, at least with respect to the dopamine system, fundamentally distinct molecular mechanisms in the unique genetic liability for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Elevated risk for schizophrenia is associated with a variation in the <i>DTNBP1</i> gene encoding dysbindin-1, which may underpin cognitive impairments in this prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve anomalies in glutamate and dopamine signaling, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Indeed, mice with <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations exhibit spatial and working memory deficits that are associated with deficits in glutamate release and NMDA receptor function as determined by slice electrophysiology. The present study extended the results from ex vivo approaches by examining how the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation impacts high K+- and NMDA receptor-evoked glutamate release within the PFC using in vivo microdialysis procedures. <i>Dntbp1</i> mutant mice are also reported to exhibit blunted K+-evoked dopamine release within the PFC. Thus, we examined also K+- and NMDA-evoked dopamine release within this region. Perfusion of high-concentration K+ or NMDA solutions increased the PFC levels of both dopamine and glutamate in wild-type (WT) but not in <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutants (MUT), whereas mice heterozygous for the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation (HET) exhibited blunted K+-evoked dopamine release. No net-flux microdialysis procedures confirmed elevated basal extracellular content of both glutamate and dopamine within the PFC of HET and MUT mice. These in vivo microdialysis results corroborate prior indications that <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations perturb evoked dopamine and glutamate release within the PFC, provide in vivo evidence for impaired NMDA receptor function within the PFC, and suggest that these neurochemical anomalies may be related to abnormally elevated basal neurotransmitter content.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease, but the initiation mechanisms are unclear. Although antipsychotics are effective against positive symptoms, therapeutic interventions for negative symptoms are limited due to the lack of pathophysiological mechanisms. Here we identify synaptotagmin-11 (Syt11) as a potential genetic risk factor and dopamine over-transmission as a mechanism in the development of schizophrenia. Syt11 expression is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia but restored following the treatment with antipsychotics. Syt11 deficiency in dopamine neurons in early adolescence, but not in adults, leads to persistent social deficits and other schizophrenia-like behaviors by mediating dopamine over-transmission in mice. Accordingly, dopamine neuron over-excitation before late adolescence induces persistent schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits, along with the structural and functional alternations in the mPFC. Notably, local intervention of D2R with clinical drugs presynaptically or postsynaptically exhibits both acute and long-lasting therapeutic effects on social deficits in schizophrenia mice models. These findings not only define Syt11 as a risk factor and DA over-transmission as a potential risk factor initiating schizophrenia, but also propose two D2R-targeting strategies for the comprehensive and long-term recovery of schizophrenia-associated social withdrawal.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. The neurodevelopmental methylazoxy-methanol acetate (MAM) rodent model replicates key neurobiological features of SCZ which includes hyperdopaminergic states in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and cognitive deficits. Typical and atypical antipsychotics are primarily effective in treating the positive symptoms of SCZ but often fall short of addressing cognitive deficits. A promising therapeutic approach for treating all symptoms of SCZ has emerged through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 10\u00a0A (PDE10A). Our study aim was to investigate the impact of acute and chronic THPP-1 (PDE10A inhibitor) treatment, in MAM rats, focusing on cognitive deficits and VTA dopamine (DA) activity. Adult offspring of pregnant rats treated with Saline or MAM (20\u00a0mg/kg) on gestational day 17 were treated with THPP-1 acutely (male/female rats; 3\u00a0mg/kg) at postnatal day (PD) 70-80 or chronically (males; 3\u00a0weeks; 2-3\u00a0mg/kg) from PD 70-91 and tested in the novel object recognition test and electrophysiological recording of DA neurons in the VTA. Acute THPP-1 treatment reversed cognitive impairments and normalized the increased number of active DA neurons in the VTA of male and female MAM rats, without affecting control rats. Also, chronic THPP-1 treatment reversed cognitive deficits and normalized DA hyperactivity in the VTA of male MAM rats. The efficacy of THPP-1 in reversing MAM-induced impairments underscores its ability to target disease-specific circuitry without affecting normal regulated systems in control rats. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of THPP-1 for addressing cognitive deficits and DA dysregulation in SCZ.",

The myelin component nervonic acid (NA) may improve demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases. This study firstly explored relationships between glial cell dysfunction and demyelination or synaptic degeneration in schizophrenia patients, and secondly determined nervonic acid therapeutic effects in a preclinical schizophrenia model of mice. Plasma samples were collected from 18 male healthy controls and 18 male schizophrenic patients (diagnosed by DSM-V) at aged 18-55. Mouse brain samples were collected from a maternal immune activation (MIA) model of schizophrenia via injecting 5\u00a0mg/kg polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Male mouse offspring (age 2.5\u00a0months, n\u2009=\u200912) were treated by clozapine (15\u00a0mg/kg/day) or fed 0.5% NA for 6\u00a0weeks. Cytokine and dopamine (DA) concentrations, and glial phenotypes and myelin markers were measured in both human plasma and mouse brain samples. In patient plasma, increased proinflammatory cytokines were associated with reactive microglia (Iba-1) up-regulation, while decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines were related to microglia (CD206) downregulation. Decreased astrocyte marker (p11) concentrations were accompanied by reduced concentrations of oligodendrocyte and synaptic markers. However, NA and DA contents were increased. Compared with control mice, SZ-like behaviors appeared in MIA male mice. Changes in microglia and astrocytes markers, and cytokine concentrations in the frontal cortex were consistent with those observed in patients' plasma. Hippocampal oligodendrocyte and synaptic marker expression were also decreased. DA content and DA/metabolite (DAPOC) were increased in MIA mouse brains. Most of these changes were normalized by both clozapine and NA. Even though some NA effects were more pronounced than clozapine, only clozapine restored cytokine function.

        "abstract": "The incidence of schizophrenia in young adulthood may be associated with intrauterine factors, such as gestational alcohol consumption. This study investigated the relationship between a single high dose of alcohol during pregnancy in Wistar rats and the development of schizophrenia in the adult life of the offspring. On the 11th day of gestation, pregnant rats received either water or alcohol via intragastric gavage. Male and female offspring were subjected to behavioral tests at 30\u00a0days of age according to the maternal group. At 60\u00a0days of age, offspring received intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (ket) or saline (SAL). After the final ketamine administration, the adult offspring underwent behavioral tests, and their brain structures were removed for biochemical analysis. Alcohol binge drinking during pregnancy induces hyperlocomotion in both young female and male offspring, with males of alcohol-exposed mothers showing reduced social interactions. In adult offspring, ketamine induced hyperlocomotion; however, only females in the alcohol\u00a0+\u00a0ket group exhibited increased locomotor activity, and a decrease in the time to first contact was observed in the alcohol group. Cognitive impairment was exclusively observed in male animals in the alcohol group. Increased serotonin and dopamine levels were observed in male rats in the alcohol\u00a0+\u00a0ket group. Biochemical alterations indicate the effects of intrauterine alcohol exposure associated with ketamine in adult animals. These behavioral and biochemical changes suggest that the impact of prenatal stressors such as alcohol persists throughout the animals' lives and may be exacerbated by a second stressor in adulthood, such as ketamine.",

        "abstract": "The dopamine theory of schizophrenia suggests that antipsychotics alleviate symptoms by blocking dopamine D2/3 receptors, yet a significant subset of patients does not respond adequately to treatment. To investigate potential predictors, we evaluated d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release and 1-year clinical outcomes in 21 antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Twenty-one antipsychotic-naive patients (6 female) underwent dopamine D2/3 receptor radioligand [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography. For estimating dopamine release, scans were performed with and without d-amphetamine pretreatment. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was performed at regular intervals over 1 year while receiving treatment in a naturalistic setting (Clinical Trial Registry: EUDRACT 2010-019586-29). A group analysis revealed no significant differences in d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release between patients with or without clinically significant improvement. However, d-amphetamine-induced dopamine release in ventral striatum was significantly associated with reductions in positive symptoms (r\u2005=\u20050.54, P\u2005=\u2005.04; uncorrected P-values); release in globus pallidus correlated with a decrease in PANSS negative (r\u2005=\u20050.58, P\u2005=\u2005.02), general (r\u2005=\u20050.53, P\u2005=\u2005.04), and total symptom scores (r\u2005=\u20050.063, P\u2005=\u2005.01).

Impairments in these computations have been observed in patients with schizophrenia and may be present in individuals with subclinical psychotic symptoms (PS). In this study, we employed delay and effort-discounting tasks with food rewards in thirty-nine participants divided into high and low levels of PS. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of effort-discounting through computational modelling of dopamine prefrontal and subcortical circuits and the electrophysiological biomarker of both delay and effort-discounting alterations through resting-state frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). Results revealed greater delay discounting in the High PS group compared to the Low PS group but no differences in the effort discounting task. However, in this task, the same levels of estimated dopamine release were associated with a lower willingness to exert effort for high-calorie food rewards in High PS participants compared to Low PS participants. Although there were no significant differences in FAA between the High PS and Low PS groups, FAA was significantly associated with the severity of participants' negative symptoms. Our study suggests that the dysfunction in temporal and effort cost computations, seen in patients with schizophrenia, may be present in individuals with subclinical PS. These findings provide valuable insight into the early vulnerability markers (behavioral, computational, and electrophysiological) for psychosis, which may aid in the development of preventive interventions.

We examined whether midbrain NM-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging contrast-to-noise ratio (NM-CNR) was higher in people with schizophrenia than in healthy control (HC) participants and whether this correlated with dopamine synthesis capacity. One hundred fifty-four participants (schizophrenia group: n\u00a0= 74, HC group: n\u00a0= 80) underwent NM-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA). A subset of the schizophrenia group (n\u00a0= 38) also received [<sup>18</sup>F]-DOPA positron emission tomography to measure dopamine synthesis capacity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup>) in the SN-VTA and striatum. SN-VTA NM-CNR was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in HC participants (effect size\u00a0= 0.38, p\u00a0= .019). This effect was greatest for voxels in the medial and ventral SN-VTA. In patients, SN-VTA K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup> positively correlated with SN-VTA NM-CNR (r\u00a0= 0.44, p\u00a0= .005) and striatal K<sub>i</sub><sup>cer</sup> (r\u00a0= 0.71, p < .001).

In particular, recent work has shown that animal models that recapitulate various endophenotypes of schizophrenia are particularly vulnerable to impairments in reality testing when undergoing mediated learning. Multiple studies have indicated that these effects are dopamine receptor 2-dependent and correlated with aberrant insular cortex (IC) activity. However, until now, the connection between dopamine and the IC had not been investigated. Here, we utilized a novel intersectional approach to label mesencephalic dopamine cells that specifically project to the insular cortex in both wild-type controls and transgenic mice expressing the dominant-negative form of the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC-1) gene. Using these techniques, we identified a population of cells that project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the IC. Afterward, we conducted multiple studies to test the necessity of this circuit in behaviors ranging from gustatory detection to the maintenance of effort and, finally, mediated performance. Our results indicate that perturbations of the DISC-1 genetic locus lead to a reduction in the number of cells in the VTA \u2192 IC circuit. Behaviorally, VTA \u2192 IC circuitry does not influence gustatory detection or motivation to acquire sucrose reward; however, inactivation of this circuit differentially suppresses Pavlovian approach behavior in wild-type and DISC-1 transgenic mice during mediated performance testing. Moreover, under these testing conditions, inactivation of this circuit predisposes wild-type (but not DISC-1) mice to display impaired reality testing.

        "abstract": "For nearly fifty years, the dopamine hypothesis has dominated our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and provided the lone target for drug development. However, with the exception of clozapine, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonizing anti-psychotic drugs have little impact on the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, aspects of the disorder that robustly predict outcome. Pathologic studies reveal cortical atrophy and wide-spread loss of glutamatergic synaptic spines, unexplained by dopaminergic malfunction. Recent genome-wide association studies indicate that at least thirty risk genes for schizophrenia encode proteins localized to the glutamatergic synapse and inhibit glutamate neurotransmission, especially at the NMDA receptor. To function, the NMDA receptor requires the binding of glycine (primarily in the cerebellum and brainstem) or D-serine (in forebrain) to the NR1 channel subunit of the NMDA receptor. Genetically silencing the gene (srr) encoding serine racemase, the biosynthetic enzyme for D-serine, results in forebrain NMDA receptor hypofunction. The srr-/- mice have 90\u00a0% loss of endogenous D-serine and approximately 70\u00a0% decrease in NMDA receptor function. Several animal models of schizophrenia are based on behavioral and pharmacologic strategies, which have negligible validity with regard to the fundamental etiology of schizophrenia. We summarize here the results of a mouse model, in which srr, one of the two dozen or more risk gene for schizophrenia that affect NMDA receptor function, has been inactivated. The srr-/- mice exhibit striking similarities to schizophrenia including cortical atrophy, loss of cortico-limbic glutamatergic synapses, increased sub-cortical dopamine release, EEG abnormalities, and cognitive impairments. The limited efficacy of drugs targeting the glutamatergic synapse on DSM-5 diagnosed criteria for schizophrenia used in clinical trials may reflect the fact that only 30\u00a0% of the patients have impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission, resulting from the genetic heterogeneity of the disorder.",

Patients with schizophrenia exhibited poorer cognitive performance, reduced FC between DLPFC/MiFG and the caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen, decreased DAT availability in the left CN, and decreased right-left DAT asymmetry in the CN compared to HCs. In patients with schizophrenia, altered imaging markers are associated with cognitive impairments, especially the relationship between DLPFC/MiFG-putamen FC and attention and between DAT asymmetry in the CN and executive function. This study is the first to demonstrate how prefrontal-striatal hypoconnectivity and altered striatal DAT markers are associated with different domains of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. More research is needed to evaluate their complex relationships and potential therapeutic implications.",

        "title": "New Drug Treatments for Schizophrenia: A Review of Approaches to Target Circuit Dysfunction.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a leading cause of global disease burden. Current drug treatments are associated with significant side effects and have limited efficacy for many patients, highlighting the need to develop new approaches that target other aspects of the neurobiology of schizophrenia. Preclinical, in\u00a0vivo imaging, postmortem, genetic, and pharmacological studies have highlighted the key role of cortical GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic)-glutamatergic microcircuits and their projections to subcortical dopaminergic circuits in the pathoetiology of negative, cognitive, and psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotics primarily act downstream of the dopaminergic component of this circuit. However, multiple drugs are currently in development that could target other elements of this circuit to treat schizophrenia. These include drugs for GABAergic or glutamatergic targets, including glycine transporters, D-amino acid oxidase, sodium channels, or potassium channels. Other drugs in development are likely to primarily act on pathways that regulate the dopaminergic system, such as muscarinic or trace amine receptors or 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, while PDE10A inhibitors are being developed to modulate the downstream consequences of dopaminergic dysfunction. Our review considers where new drugs may act on this circuit and their latest clinical trial evidence in terms of indication, efficacy, and side effects. Limitations of the circuit model, including whether there are neurobiologically distinct subgroups of patients, and future directions are also considered. Several drugs based on the mechanisms reviewed have promising clinical data, with the muscarinic agonist KarXT most advanced. If these drugs are approved for clinical use, they have the potential to revolutionize understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "title": "Correlation between toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia in Egyptian patients and its impact on dopamine serum levels.",
        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite infecting around one-third of the global population, has been linked to neurological disorders like schizophrenia. Abnormal dopamine levels are linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, but their association remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between T. gondii seroprevalence and dopamine serum levels in schizophrenic patients in Egypt. This case-control study included 93 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 93 individuals as controls. T. gondii seroprevalence was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dopamine serum levels were measured using ELISA. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were also collected. The study found a higher prevalence of T. gondii IgG antibodies in patients with schizophrenia (68 %) compared to controls (46.2 %). Contact with cats, sausage consumption, and undercooked meat were identified as possible risk factors associated with T. gondii infection. The mean level of serum dopamine was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in patients with schizophrenia (115.3 Pg/ml \u00b131.8) compared to the control group (75.02 Pg/ml \u00b126.5). The study found that schizophrenic patients with T. gondii seropositivity had significantly higher dopamine serum levels (mean=145.2 \u00b1 32.1 pg/ml) than those without T. gondii seropositivity (mean=122.5 \u00b1 29.7 pg/ml) (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that T. gondii seropositivity was a significant predictor of increased dopamine serum levels in schizophrenic patients (odds ratio=3.4, 95 % confidence interval=1.8-6.4, p < 0.001). The study suggests that T. gondii seroprevalence may increase dopamine serum levels in Egyptian schizophrenic patients, potentially contributing to dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia, but further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms.",

        "title": "Understanding the role of early life stress and schizophrenia on anxiety and depressive like outcomes: An experimental study.",
        "abstract": "Adverse experiences due to early life stress (ELS) or parental psychopathology such as schizophrenia (SZ) have a significant implication on individual susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in the future. However, it is not fully understood how ELS affects social-associated behaviors as well as the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ELS and ketamine induced schizophrenia like symptoms (KSZ) on anhedonia, social behavior and anxiety-like behavior. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups were allocated randomly into eight experimental groups, namely control, gestational stress (GS), GS+KSZ, maternal separation (MS), MS+KSZ pups, KSZ parents, KSZ parents and Pups and KSZ pups only. ELS was induced by subjecting the pups to GS and MS, while schizophrenia like symptoms was induced through subcutaneous administration of ketamine. Behavioral assessment included sucrose preference test (SPT) and elevated plus maze (EPM), followed by dopamine testing and analysis of astrocyte density. Statistical analysis involved ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests, revealing significant group differences and yielding insights into behavioral and neurodevelopmental impacts. GS, MS, and KSZ (dams) significantly reduced hedonic response and increased anxiety-like responses (p < 0.05). Notably, the presence of normal parental mental health demonstrated a reversal of the observed decline in Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein-positive astrocytes (GFAP+ astrocytes) (p < 0.05) and a reduction in anxiety levels, implying its potential protective influence on depressive-like symptoms and PFC astrocyte functionality. The present study provides empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that exposure to ELS and KSZ on dams have a significant impact on the on development of anxiety and depressive like symptoms in Sprague Dawley rats, while positive parenting has a reversal effect.",

        "title": "Chronic social stressors and striatal dopamine functioning in humans: A systematic review of SPECT and PET studies.",
        "abstract": "The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia posits that elevated striatal dopamine functioning underlies the development of psychotic symptoms. Chronic exposure to social stressors increases psychosis risk, possibly by upregulating striatal dopamine functioning. Here we systematically review single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies that examined the relationship between chronic social stress exposure and in vivo striatal dopamine functioning in humans. We searched the scientific databases PubMed and PsycINFO from inception to August 2023. The quality of the included studies was evaluated with the ten-item Observational Study Quality Evaluation (PROSPERO: CRD42022308883). Twenty-eight studies were included, which measured different aspects of striatal dopamine functioning including dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 binding, dopamine release following a pharmacological or behavioral challenge, D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor binding, and dopamine transporter binding. We observed preliminary evidence of an association between childhood trauma and increased striatal DSC and dopamine release. However, exposure to low socioeconomic status, stressful life events, or other social stressors was not consistently associated with altered striatal dopamine functioning. The quality of available studies was generally low. In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence that chronic social stressors upregulate striatal dopamine functioning in humans. We propose avenues for future research, in particular to improve the measurement of chronic social stressors and the methodological quality of study designs.",

        "title": "Dopamine signaling enriched striatal gene set predicts striatal dopamine synthesis and physiological activity in vivo.",
        "abstract": "The polygenic architecture of schizophrenia implicates several molecular pathways involved in synaptic function. However, it is unclear how polygenic risk funnels through these pathways to translate into syndromic illness. Using tensor decomposition, we analyze gene co-expression in the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of post-mortem brain samples from 358 individuals. We identify a set of genes predominantly expressed in the caudate nucleus and associated with both clinical state and genetic risk for schizophrenia that shows dopaminergic selectivity. A higher polygenic risk score for schizophrenia parsed by this set of genes predicts greater dopamine synthesis in the striatum and greater striatal activation during reward anticipation. These results translate dopamine-linked genetic risk variation into in vivo neurochemical and hemodynamic phenotypes in the striatum that have long been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",
