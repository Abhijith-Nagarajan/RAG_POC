        "title": "Serotonergic underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings.",
        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequent and disabling condition, with many patients being treatment-resistant. Improved understanding of its neurobiology is vital for better therapies. Evidence is still conflicting regarding specific serotonergic-related dysfunctions in OCD. We systematically reviewed the literature to provide a quantitative assessment of the role of serotonin (5-HT) in patients with untreated OCD through imaging. We searched for neuroimaging studies investigating central 5-HT tonus in unmedicated patients with OCD, excluding studies comprising treated patients to prevent bias from antidepressant-induced changes in serotonergic tonus. We also conducted a meta-analysis using a homogeneous group of positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography articles that compared 5-HT transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A receptor (HT2AR) binding potential in different brain regions of patients with untreated OCD and healthy controls. The systematic review encompassed 18 articles, with 13 included in the subsequent meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed by a revised form of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We provided standardized mean difference (SMD) values for SERT and 5-HT2AR binding potential measures across 15 different brain regions. Patients with OCD showed lower SERT binding potential in the brainstem (SMD\u2009=\u2009-1.13,\u00a095% CI [-1.81 to -0.46]), midbrain (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.54, 95% CI [-0.92 to -0.16]), and thalamus/hypothalamus regions (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.58, 95% CI [-0.99 to -0.18]) with neglectable to moderate heterogeneity. By combining results from 2 decades of molecular imaging studies, we show that individuals with OCD exhibit lower SERT binding potential in specific brain regions, providing compelling evidence of a 5-HT system dysfunction. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain elusive. The limitations include heterogeneity across studies in populations, imaging techniques, and radiotracer usage.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",

        "abstract": "Autoimmune-mediated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can occur in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, a well-studied case study of a patient with OCD and MS-compatible diagnostic findings is presented. The 42-year-old female patient had displayed OCD symptoms for 6\u00a0years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses detected an increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, and a positive MRZ reaction. Neopterin was increased, but sarcoidosis was excluded. In the absence of neurological attacks and clues for MRI-based dissemination in time, a radiologically isolated syndrome, the pre-disease stage of MS, was diagnosed. Neurotransmitter measurements of CSF detected reduced serotonin levels. In the absence of visible strategic demyelinating lesions within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes. Serotonin abnormalities in MS should be studied further, as they could potentially explain the association between neuroinflammation and mental illnesses.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin has been suggested to modulate decision-making by influencing the arbitration between model-based and model-free control. Disruptions in these control mechanisms are involved in mental disorders such as drug dependence or obsessive-compulsive disorder. While previous reports indicate that lower brain serotonin levels reduce model-based control, it remains unknown whether increases in serotonergic availability might thus increase model-based control. Moreover, the mediating neural mechanisms have not been studied yet. The first aim of this study was to investigate whether increased/decreased tonic serotonin levels affect the arbitration between model-free and model-based control. Second, we aimed to identify the underlying neural processes. We employed a sequential two-stage Markov decision-task and measured brain responses during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 98 participants in a randomized, double-blind cross-over within-subject design. To investigate the influence of serotonin on the balance between model-free and model-based control, we used a tryptophan intervention with three intervention levels (loading, balanced, depletion). We hypothesized that model-based behaviour would increase with higher serotonin levels. We found evidence that neither model-free nor model-based control were affected by changes in tonic serotonin levels. Furthermore, our tryptophan intervention did not elicit relevant changes in Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent activity.",

        "abstract": "The interplay between environmental stress and genetic factors is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the relative contribution of these causative antecedents in the manifestation of cognitive inflexibility-a phenotype often seen in obsessive-compulsive (OC)- spectrum disorders-is not fully understood. In this study, we treated mice with 50\u00a0mg/L corticosterone (CORT, a glucocorticoid stress hormone) in their drinking water during adolescence. In adulthood, we assessed anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity; along with operant-based discrimination and reversal learning. RU-24969, a selective serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonist, was used as an acute pharmacological model of OC-like behaviour. RU-24969 (5\u00a0mg/kg) was administered prior to each reversal learning testing session. We found that acute treatment with 5\u00a0mg/kg RU-24969 induced stereotyped hyperlocomotion in vehicle- and CORT-treated mice. Furthermore, pre-treatment with CORT in adolescence produced subtle anxiety-like behaviour in adult mice, and also resulted in an impairment to late-stage discrimination learning and alterations to reversal learning. Finally, acute treatment with 5\u00a0mg/kg RU-24969 caused an impairment to early-stage reversal learning. Whilst we revealed dissociable detrimental effects of adolescent CORT treatment and acute 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonism on discrimination and reversal learning, respectively, we did not find evidence of additive deleterious effects of these two treatments. We therefore suggest that while disrupted serotonergic signalling is likely to be involved in the cognitive phenotype of OC-spectrum disorders, distinct neuropathological pathways may be at play in mediating the role of stress as an antecedent in OCD and related illnesses.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common mental disorder, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the cornerstone of its pharmacological treatment. About 40-60% of the cases are treatment-refractory, and this makes searching for second-line treatment necessary. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonists are among the many medications that have been used in augmentation with SSRIs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in augmentation with SSRIs in treating moderate to severe OCD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar for relevant trials published up to December 2022. The effect size was the mean difference in Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) scores before and after receiving 5-HT3 receptor antagonist drugs in augmentation with SSRIs in moderate to severe OCD patients. We included 6 randomized-controlled trails (RCTs) with 334 patients assessing the effect of the augmentation of SSRIs with ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron on treating moderate to severe OCD. Our results were in favor of the experimental group in total (Z\u2009=\u20098.37, P\u2009<\u20090.00001), in the compulsion subgroup (Z\u2009=\u20095.22, P\u2009<\u20090.00001), and in the obsession subgroup (Z\u2009=\u20098.33, P\u2009<\u20090.00001). They are well-tolerated, and have mild side effects and do not result in withdrawal. Augmentation of 5-HT3 antagonists with SSRIs can be beneficial in treating moderate to severe OCD. Further multi-center trials under adequate conditions in longer periods are needed to help come up with a comprehensive action plan.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder whose etiopathogenesis, according to various neuroimaging studies, seems to be linked to selective dysfunctions in regions within the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuit. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line therapy for OCD but their neurobiological effects on the brain is only partially understood. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight structural and functional brain imaging modifications induced by SSRIs treatment. A literature search on PubMed, Psych-Info and Embase database was performed. Studies including patients with OCD that analyzed the effect of SSRIs through structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging were selected. Seven relevant studies were considered eligible for the present review. Overall, the results of the reviewed studies showed that SSRIs treatment seems to normalize structural, in terms of the white matter and gray matter volumes, and functional activity alterations observed in OCD patients, especially in regions within the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The poor design of the studies, the small and heterogeneous samples, differences in age, gender, illness course, comorbidities, treatment protocols and the different magnetic fields used make it difficult to generalize the results. From the available evidence it emerged that SSRIs treatment has proven to be effective in normalizing brain structural and functional alterations observed in OCD patients. However, future neuroimaging investigations should focus on long-term effects of drugs on brain structure and function in OCD patients through longitudinal approaches in order to identify more effective treatments for these patients.",

We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another.

        "abstract": "Preliminary clinical findings, supported by preclinical studies employing behavioral paradigms such as marble burying, suggest that psilocybin may be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the receptor mechanisms implicated in the putative anti-obsessional effect are not clear. On this background, we set out to explore (1) the role of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying; (2) the effect of staggered versus bolus psilocybin administration and persistence of the effect; (3) the effect of the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone, on marble-burying and the head twitch response (HTR) induced by psilocybin, a rodent correlate of psychedelic effects. Male ICR mice were administered psilocybin 4.4\u2009mg/kg, escitalopram 5\u2009mg/kg, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) 2\u2009mg/kg, M100907 2\u2009mg/kg, buspirone 5\u2009mg/kg, WAY100635 2\u2009mg/kg or combinations, intraperitoneally, and were tested on the marble burying test. HTR was examined in a magnetometer-based assay. The results show that (1) Psilocybin and escitalopram significantly reduced marble burying. The effect of psilocybin was not attenuated by the 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907. The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, reduced marble burying as did the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was additive to that of psilocybin, but that of buspirone was not. The 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone but not the effect of psilocybin. (2) Psilocybin injections over 3.5\u2009h had no effect on marble burying and the effect of bolus injection was not persistent. (3) Co-administration of buspirone with psilocybin blocked its effect on HTR. These data suggest that neither 5-HT2A nor 5-HT1A receptors are pivotally implicated in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying. Co-administration with buspirone may block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin without impeding its anti-obsessional effects.",

Nevertheless, the remaining symptoms continue to impair the patients' function. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate possible strategies to improve the mitigation of symptoms. In this study, the main objective was to examine and investigate the effectiveness of granisetron, which is a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) antagonist, as an adjunct therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for the purpose of ameliorating OCD symptoms. fifty-eight patients diagnosed with OCD, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, who had a Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) score of more than 21 were recruited in a double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of 10 weeks to receive either granisetron (1\u00a0mg twice daily) and sertraline (100\u00a0mg daily initially followed by 200\u00a0mg daily after week 4) or placebo and sertraline. The primary outcome was OCD symptoms measured by the Y-BOCS. Y-BOCS total score significantly dropped in both groups (28.9 to 17.7 for granisetron plus sertraline and 27.5 to 19.3 for placebo plus sertraline group with a slightly greater drop for granisetron plus sertraline group), while the granisetron plus sertraline group experienced a significantly greater reduction in obsession scores (Greenhouse-Geisser F(2.32,97.57)\u2009=\u20094.52,p-value\u2009=\u20090.01). Moreover, in comparison with the placebo plus sertraline group, the proportion of the patients showing complete response was considerably higher among the granisetron plus sertraline group (P-value\u2009<\u20090.01). No major adverse effects were observed in any of the groups. The results suggest that granisetron augmentation of sertraline may increase the rate of response in patients with moderate to severe non-refractory OCD.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are first-line treatment and are of benefit to about half of patients. Augmentation of SRI treatment with low-dose neuroleptics is an evidence-based second-line strategy. Specialty psychotherapy is also used as both first-line and second-line treatment and can benefit many. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to these treatments. New alternatives are urgently needed. This review summarizes evidence for these established pharmacotherapeutic strategies, and for others that have been investigated in refractory disease but are not supported by the same level of evidence. We focus on three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We summarize evidence from genetic, neuroimaging, animal model, and other lines of investigation that probe these three systems in patients with OCD. We also review recent work on predictors of response to current treatments. While many studies suggest abnormalities that may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, most studies have been small, and non-replication of reported findings has been common. Nevertheless, the gradual accrual of evidence for neurotransmitter dysregulation may in time lead the way to new pharmacological strategies.",

We examined obsessive-compulsive (OC) traits, including hoarding, in a total of 5,213 pediatric participants in the community. We genotyped candidate serotonin genes (5-HTTLPR polymorphism in\u00a0SLC6A4 for 2,018 individuals and single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] across genes SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR1B for 4,711 individuals).

The [L<sub>G</sub> +S] variant in 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with hoarding alone in males (p-value of 0.009). There were no significant findings for 5-HTTLPR in females. There were no significant findings after correction for multiple comparisons using SNP array data, but top SNP findings suggested that variation downstream of HTR1B may be implicated in hoarding alone in females. Our results suggest specific serotonin gene variants are associated with hoarding traits alone, differing between sexes. Top findings are in line with our former study, suggesting that individuals with hoarding alone were driving previous results. Our paper supports hoarding disorder's new designation.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin system genes are commonly studied in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but genetic studies to date have produced inconsistent results, possibly because phenotypic heterogeneity has not been adequately accounted for. In this paper, we studied candidate serotonergic genes and homogenous phenotypic subgroups as presented through obsessive-compulsive (OC) trait dimensions in a general population of children and adolescents. We hypothesized that different serotonergic gene variants are associated with different OC trait dimensions and, furthermore, that they vary by sex. Obsessive-compulsive trait dimensions (Cleaning/Contamination, Counting/Checking, Symmetry/Ordering, Superstition, Rumination, and Hoarding) were examined in a total of 5,213 pediatric participants in the community using the Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (TOCS). We genotyped candidate serotonin genes (directly genotyping the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in SLC6A4 for 2018 individuals and using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data for genes SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR1B for 4711 individuals). We assessed the association between variants across these genes and each of the OC trait dimensions, within males and females separately. We analyzed OC traits as both (a) dichotomized based on a threshold value and (b) quantitative scores. The [L<sub>G</sub> + S] variant in 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with hoarding in males (p-value of 0.003 and 0.004 for categorical and continuous analyses, respectively). There were no significant findings for 5-HTTLPR in females. Using SNP array data, there were significant findings for rumination in males for HTR2A SNPs (p-value of 1.04e-6 to 5.20e-6). This represents the first genetic association study of OC trait dimensions in a community-based pediatric sample. Our strongest results indicate that hoarding and rumination may be distinct in their association with serotonin gene variants and that serotonin gene variation may be specific to sex. Future genetic association studies in OCD should properly account for heterogeneity, using homogenous subgroups stratified by symptom dimension, sex, and age group.",

        "title": "Serotonin system gene variants and regional brain volume differences in pediatric OCD.",
        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is phenotypically heterogeneous and genetically complex. This study aimed to reduce heterogeneity using structural brain imaging to study putative intermediate phenotypes for OCD. We hypothesized that select serotonin gene variants would differ in their relationship with brain volume in specific regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits between OCD patients and controls. In a total of 200 pediatric subjects, we genotyped candidate serotonin genes (SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR1B, and HTR2C) and conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to measure regional brain volumes within CSTC circuits. In males and females separately, we first tested the association between serotonin gene variants and OCD and the effect of serotonin gene variants on brain volume irrespective of diagnosis. We then carried out a series of analyses to assess the effect of genotype-diagnosis interaction on brain volume. In females, but not in males, we identified a statistically significant genotype-diagnosis interaction for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTR2C, rs12860460 (interaction term estimate of 5.45\u00a0cc and interaction P value of 9.70e-8) and rs12854485 (interaction term estimate of 4.28\u00a0cc and interaction P value of 2.07e-6). The tested allele in each SNP was associated with decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volume in controls and with increased ACC volume in OCD patients. Our findings suggest that, in females, sequence variation in HTR2C influences ACC volume in pediatric OCD. The variants may contribute to differences in ACC volume and to OCD in a sex-specific manner when acting together with other genetic, biological, and/or environmental factors.",

        "abstract": "Folate is important for the synthesis of serotonin the neurotransmitter which plays a main role in OCD. We, therefore, explored the efficacy of folic acid as add on treatment to fluoxetine in a double blind study among patients with OCD. A double blind, 12-week study comparing the efficacy of folic acid as add on treatment and placebo in patients with OCD was conducted on thirty six (36) patients. Patients were randomly assigned to folic acid (5 mg/day) or placebo group in addition to fluoxetine (40 mg/day). After the baseline assessment, on week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 assessments were performed by using YBOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A and CGI-S. Serum folate, erythrocyte folate, serum homocysteine and B<sub>12</sub> levels were measured both baseline and the end of study. A mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA on Y-BOCS scores were used to determine the difference between folic acid and placebo groups. No significant differences were found in the ratios of gender or in the mean age, serum folic acid level, erythrocyte folate level, serum homocysteine level and serum B<sub>12</sub> level between the treatment groups at the baseline. Consecutively scores collected over six measurements on YBOCS, HAM-D, HAM-A and CGI showed non-significant differences between folic acid and placebo groups. None of the biological markers of one carbon metabolism were associated with the change in YBOCS scores. It may be assumed that there is no beneficial effect of folic acid addition to fluoxetine in the treatment of OCD.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is considered a heterogeneous anxiety disorder that includes compulsions. Celecoxib is considered an adjuvant to fluoxetine in the management of OCD in a clinical study. However, the experimental evidence is yet to be established. Therefore, the antianxiety and anticompulsive-like activity of celecoxib (20\u2009mg/kg, orally) was evaluated in the presence or absence of fluoxetine (20\u2009mg/kg, orally) in mice who were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 14 consecutive days. Seven-day treatment of celecoxib significantly attenuated the CUMS-induced anxiety in open-field, hole-board, elevated plus maze tests, and compulsion in the marble-burying test. Celecoxib significantly reversed the CUMS-induced decrease and increase in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) in the prefrontal cortex, and attenuated the CUMS-induced increase in the levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the prefrontal cortex. Celecoxib also potentiated the anxiolytic, anticompulsive, serotonergic, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activity of 7-day treatment with fluoxetine in CUMS-challenged animals compared with their monotherapy. Thus, it can be speculated that the combination of an anti-inflammatory agent with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor could be a better therapeutic option in the management of stress-related disorders including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant OCD.",

        "abstract": "First-onset or recurrence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is common after childbirth. Postpartum OCD can occur alone or in combination with other psychiatric disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders. Putative etiological mechanisms involve consideration of genetic factors, alterations in the serotonin system secondary to changes in levels of gonadal hormones, rise in oxytocin, hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis hyperactivity, and neuroinflammation. Sleep deprivation arising from a host of diverse factors is common after delivery in women with postpartum OCD. The author suggests that sleep deprivation may play a critical role in the etiology of postpartum OCD. Clinical and research implications of this hypothesis are discussed.",

        "title": "Relationship Between Neuroanatomical and Serotonergic Hypotheses of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Combined Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Evoked Potential Study.",
        "abstract": "The so-called neuroanatomical hypothesis (with an increased activity of orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]) and the serotonergic hypothesis (with low activity in this system) have been discussed regarding the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for decades. This study aimed to look for a relationship between the 2 pathogenetic concepts. Nineteen OCD patients (8 female, 11 male, mean \u00b1 SD age = 33.37 \u00b1 11.73 years, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale: 21.79 \u00b1 6.59; diagnosed by ICD-10/DSM-IV-TR) were compared to 19 matched healthy controls (8 female, 11 male, mean \u00b1 SD age = 31.63 \u00b1 10.79 years) and investigated (2012-2014) with the loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP) as a marker of the synaptic serotonergic activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the delay discounting paradigm, inducing OFC blood-oxygen level-dependent activity in the 2 groups. There were significant correlation coefficients between LDAEP (eLORETA right side) and fMRI OFC activities (anatomic region of interest) within the delay discounting paradigm (immediate vs control) in patients with OCD (r = -0.554; P = .014). LDAEP differed between the 2 groups with larger LDAEP at Cz in OCD patients indicating low serotonergic activity (0.28 \u00b1 0.14 vs 0.20 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b5V/10 dB, F\u2082,\u2083\u2085 = 4.66, P = .016). fMRI activations of dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex as well as ventral striatum (functional region of interest) were different between OCD and healthy volunteers. The 2 main pathophysiologic hypotheses of OCD seem to be related to each other as measured by LDAEP and fMRI OFC activity during the delay discounting task. This could be interpreted as a further hint that low serotonergic activity induces altered OFC responsivity, which has to be treated in each patient with OCD by a serotonin agonist.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are both effective treatments for some patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), yet little is known about the neurochemical changes related to these treatment modalities. Here, we used positron emission tomography and the \u03b1-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-L-tryptophan tracer to examine the changes in brain regional serotonin synthesis capacity in OCD patients following treatment with CBT or SSRI treatment. Sixteen medication-free OCD patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either CBT or sertraline treatment. Pre-to-post treatment changes in the \u03b1-[<sup>11</sup>C]methyl-L-tryptophan brain trapping constant, K* (ml/g/min), were assessed as a function of symptom response, and correlations with symptom improvement were examined. Responders/partial responders to treatment did not show significant changes in relative regional tracer uptake; rather, in responders/partial responders, 12 weeks of treatment led to serotonin synthesis capacity increases that were brain-wide. Irrespective of treatment modality, baseline serotonin synthesis capacity in the raphe nuclei correlated positively with clinical improvement. These observations suggest that, for some patients, successful remediation of OCD symptoms might be associated with greater serotonergic tone.",

        "title": "Improved serotonergic neurotransmission by genistein pretreatment regulates symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.",
        "abstract": "Background Initial evidences have shown that diabetes mellitus occurs concomitantly with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptomatology. Serotonergic psychiatric therapy posits that serotonin is a central character in the management of OCD. Hence, it is worth investigating novel chemical entities affecting the serotonergic system for targeting OCD. An isoflavonoid phytoestrogen, genistein, has been recognized as of great pharmacological value especially for protecting neurodegeneration, depression (serotonin regulation), and diabetes. The effectiveness of genistein pretreatment on the symptoms of OCD in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice is investigated in this study. We also evaluate the probable involvement of the serotonergic system. Methods Groups of diabetic mice were treated with genistein at the dose of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg (intraperitoneal, twice daily, 14 days), and symptoms of OCD were assessed by the marble-burying behavior, in comparison with the standard drug fluoxetine. Neurochemical assessment of the serotonergic ratio 5-hydroxyindole-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HIAA/5-HT) in the cortical region of the brain was performed using HPLC (high-pressure liquid chromatography). Results Chronic treatment with genistein significantly recovered [F(6, 35)=53.00, p<0.0001, R2=0.9008] the symptoms of OCD as assessed by marble burying behavior in normal and diabetic mice. Locomotor performance was not influenced by the diabetic condition or any associated treatment. The turnover of serotonin neurotransmission (5-HIAA/5-HT) was significantly boosted in the diabetic condition; genistein treatment dragged it [F(6, 35)=35.75, p<0.0001, R2=0.8597] toward the respective control. Conclusions Genistein supplementation might be a potential therapeutic line for the management and/or prevention of diabetes-associated OCD symptomatology.",
