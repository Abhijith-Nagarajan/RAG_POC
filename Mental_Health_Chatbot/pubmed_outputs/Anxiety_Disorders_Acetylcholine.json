        "title": "Choline metabolism in regulating inflammatory bowel disease-linked anxiety disorders: A multi-omics exploration of the gut-brain axis.",
        "abstract": "Anxiety and depression caused by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) negatively affect the mental health of patients. Emerging studies have demonstrated that the gut-brain axis (GBA) mediates IBD-induced mood disorders, but the underlying mechanisms of these findings remain unknown. Therefore, it's vital to conduct comprehensive research on the GBA in IBD. Multi-omics studies can provide an understanding of the pathological mechanisms of the GBA in the development of IBD, helping to uncover the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of the disease. Thus, we analyzed the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (DSS)-induced IBD mice using transcriptomics and metabolomics. We observed increased mRNA related to acetylcholine synthesis and secretion, along with decreased phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels in the PFC of DSS group compared to the control group. Fecal metagenomics also revealed abnormalities in the microbiome and lipid metabolism in the DSS group. Since both acetylcholine and PC are choline metabolites, we posited that the DSS group may experience choline deficiency and choline metabolism disorders. Subsequently, when we supplemented CDP-choline, IBD mice exhibited improvements, including decreased anxiety-like behaviors, reduced PC degradation, and increased acetylcholine synthesis in the PFC. In addition, administration of CDP-choline can restore imbalances in the gut microbiome and disruptions in lipid metabolism caused by DSS treatment. This study provides compelling evidence to suggest that choline metabolism plays a crucial role in the development and treatment of mood disorders in IBD. Choline and its metabolites appear to have a significant role in maintaining the stability of the GBA.",

        "abstract": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress, and CRF antagonists may be effective for the treatment of stress-related disorders including major depressive and anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated the in vivo pharmacological profile of N-cyclopropylmethyl-7-(2,6-dimethoxy-4-methoxymethylphenyl)-2-ethyl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylmethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-amine tosylate (E2508), a recently synthesized, orally active CRF1 receptor antagonist. Oral administration of a single dose of E2508 (3 or 10mg/kg), but not fluoxetine (30mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), significantly shortened immobility time in rats in the forced swim test. E2508 (10, 30, or 100mg/kg) also showed an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test in mice, with no sedative or muscle relaxant effects for doses up to 100mg/kg. Moreover, E2508 (5 or 20mg/kg) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in the rat defensive burying test. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, also showed an anxiolytic effect in the defensive burying test at the same dose that induced a muscle relaxant effect in mice. Administration of E2508 (30mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days did not affect sexual behavior. By contrast, fluoxetine (30mg/kg) administration for \u22657 consecutive days decreased sexual behavior. These results indicate that E2508 has both potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models, and is well tolerated compared with a commonly prescribed therapeutic SSRI or benzodiazepine.",

        "abstract": "Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in rodents induces a wide spectrum of functional disturbances, including behavioral, neurochemical, and neuromorphological alterations. We have examined the effects of OBX on behavior and the parameters of the cholinergic system in female rats and mice. In rats, OBX resulted in the appearance of some depressive-like behavioral marks, such as the decreased sucrose consumption, hyperactivity, impaired short-term memory and anxiety-like behavioral features, such as shortened presence in the center of the open field arena or open arms of the elevated plus-maze and an enhancement of avoidance behavior. These behavioral abnormalities could be associated with disturbances in hippocampal function, this suggestion being supported by the presence of cellular changes in this brain structure. No effect of OBX on the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band as well as on the acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity in the septum, hippocampus, and neocortex could be detected. In contrast, in mice, OBX impaired spontaneous alternation behavior and decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band. These data demonstrate that rats and mice differently respond to OBX, in particular, OBX does not significantly affect the cholinergic system in rats.",

        "abstract": "In comparison to studies of the involvement of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), research on the involvement of the cholinergic system in this disorder has remained sparse. The aim of this study was to test the role of the cholinergic system in compulsive behavior using the signal attenuation rat model of OCD. In this model, \"compulsive\" behavior is induced by attenuating a signal indicating that a lever-press response was effective in producing food. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15\u00a0mg/kg), the nicotinic agonist nicotine (0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.00\u00a0mg/kg), the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (1, 3, 5, and 8\u00a0mg/kg), the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (0.0075, 0.0150, and 0.0300\u00a0mg/kg), and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.15, 0.50, 1.00, and 1.50\u00a0mg/kg) were acutely administered to rats just before assessing their lever-press responding following signal attenuation (experiments 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively). Because the effects of signal attenuation are assessed under extinction conditions, drug doses that were effective in the above experiments were also tested in an extinction session of lever-press responding that was not preceded by signal attenuation (experiments 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Acute systemic administration of the cholinergic agents did not exert a selective anti- or pro-compulsive effect in the signal attenuation model. Acetylcholine does not seem to play a role in the signal attenuation rat model of OCD.",

        "abstract": "Some investigations have shown that the glutamate receptors play a critical role in cognitive processes such as learning and anxiety. The possible involvement of the cholinergic system of the dorsal hippocampus in the anxiolytic-like response induced by MK-801, NMDA receptor antagonist, was investigated in the present study. Male Wistar rats were used in the elevated plus maze apparatus to test the parameters: open arm time (%OAT), open arm entries (%OAE), close arm time (%CAT), close arm entries (%CAE) and other exploratory behaviors (locomotor activity, grooming, rearing and defecation) of anxiety-like response. The data indicated that intra-CA1 administration of MK-801 increased %OAT (2\u03bcg/rat) and %OAE (1 and 2\u03bcg/rat) while decreased %CAT and %CAE and did not alter other exploratory behaviors, indicating an anxiolytic-like effect. Moreover, intra-hippocampal injections of mecamylamine, a cholinergic receptor antagonists (2\u03bcg/rat) and scopolamine (4\u03bcg/rat), by themselves, 5min before testing, increased %OAT and %OAE but decreased %CAT and %CAE and did not alter locomotor activity and other exploratory behaviors, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect. On the other hand, intra-CA1 co-administration of an ineffective dose of scopolamine (3\u03bcg/rat), but not mecamylamine (1\u03bcg/rat), with an ineffective dose of MK-801 (0.5\u03bcg/rat) increased %OAT and %OAE and decreased %CAT and %CAE. The data may indicate the possible involvement of the cholinergic system of the CA1 in the anxiolytic-like response induced by MK-801.",

        "title": "Physiologic mechanisms underlying the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.",
        "abstract": "The rate at which serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment is terminated and the duration of treatment appear to be key factors in predicting discontinuation symptoms. The development of animal models to explain the mechanisms of this clinical problem has proved challenging, because less than half of all patients experience any discontinuation symptoms, many of which are subjective in nature. One explanation is that SRI discontinuation symptoms may arise from the rapid decrease in serotonin (5-HT) availability when treatment ends abruptly. Yet, it would appear that discontinuation discomforts may not be mediated exclusively through 5-HT receptors, given the major regulatory role 5-HT exerts on a number of specific chemical receptor systems in the brain. As a result, attempts to explain the determinants of this phenomenon rely on a certain level of speculation. This article examines the possible physiologic bases for the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome and briefly describes these adaptations. It discusses the 3 systems most likely to account for at least part of the symptomatology--the 5-HT, the norepinephrine, and the cholinergic systems--and the possible interactions among them. It also attempts to explain their implications in the therapeutic actions of antidepressants in patients with affective and anxiety disorders.",

        "abstract": "In the present study we examined the long-term effects of neonatal lesion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons induced by intracerebroventricular injections of the immunotoxin 192 IgG saporin. Animals were then characterised behaviourally, electrophysiologically and molecularly. Cognitive effects were evaluated in the social transmission of food preferences, a non-spatial associative memory task. Electrophysiological effects were assessed by recording of cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. In addition, we measured the levels of proteins whose abnormal expression has been associated with neurodegeneration such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PS-1, PS-2), and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). In animals lesioned on postnatal day 7 and tested 6 months thereafter, memory impairment in the social transmission of food preferences was evident, as well as a significant reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, similar to what observed in Alzheimer-like dementia, EEG cortical patterns in lesioned rats presented changes in alpha, beta and delta activities. Levels of APP protein and mRNA were not affected by the treatment. Levels of hippocampal COX-2 protein and mRNA were significantly decreased whereas COX-1 remained unaltered. PS-1 and PS-2 transcripts were reduced in hippocampus and neocortex. These findings indicate that neonatal and permanent basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction is sufficient to induce behavioural and neuropathological abnormalities. This animal model could represent a valid tool to evaluate the role played by abnormal cholinergic maturation in later vulnerability to neuropathological processes associated with cognitive decline and, possibly, to Alzheimer-like dementia.",

        "abstract": "Researchers interested in investigating the possible therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of action of nicotine in neuropsychiatric disorders face a social-scientific-ethical dilemma. This dilemma comprises three components: (1) the known addictive potential of nicotine makes careful evaluation of the therapeutic potential of this compound socially unattractive; (2) the potential misuse of scientifically determined data by the tobacco 'lobby' creates ethical concerns; and (3) the possible confusion between the differential effects of nicotine in human smokers versus non-smokers creates difficulties in study designs in voluntary human subjects. Therefore, it is imperative that, at the onset of this review, the authors stress that they do not advocate cigarette-smoking as a route of nicotine intake under any circumstances on the basis that controlled dosing of nicotine may be of potential benefit in some neuropsychiatric disorders. In this article, we review the psychopharmacology of nicotine and its effects in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and Tourette's syndrome. Possible mechanisms of action of nicotine directly or indirectly via its interaction with other neurotransmitter systems (i.e. serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline) in relation to its potential role in these disorders are discussed. It is postulated that new drugs may need to be developed that selectively interact with nicotinic receptors without addiction potential.",
