        "title": "Behavior Changes in Quinpirole Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Rats Treated with 6-Hydroxydopamine and the Corresponding Dopaminergic Compulsive Loop Mechanism.",
        "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the anterior limb of the internal capsule may be an area of convergence for multiple compulsion loops. In this study, the role of different dopaminergic compulsion loops in the mechanism of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was investigated by selectively damaging dopaminergic neurons or fibers in the corresponding targets with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and depicting the anatomical map of various compulsion loops located in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. A total of 52 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to either saline (1 mL/kg, NS group, n = 6) or quinpirole (QNP, dopamine D2-agonist, 0.5 mg/kg, n = 46) twice weekly for 5 weeks. After each injection, the rats were placed on an open field to analyze aspects of their behaviour, including the number of home base visits (NOH), average time between each home base visit (ATBO), and total distance travelled (TDM). After model setup, 46 QNP rats were divided randomly into five groups: 6-OHDA anterior limb of internal capsule (AC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+AC group, n = 10), 6-OHDA mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) stereotactic injection group (QNP+MD group, n = 10), 6-OHDA nucleus accumbens (NAC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+NAC group, n = 10), saline stereotactic injection group (QNP+NS-S group, n = 10), and non-surgical group (QNP+Non-S group, n = 6). In the NS group, rats simultaneously received a 6-OHDA stereotactic injection (NS+6-OHDA-S group, n = 6: AC2, MD2, NAC2). All QNP-treated rats were then continued to be given QNP twice a week for 4 weeks, and their behaviour was observed after each infusion. After 4 weeks, immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the distribution of dopamine neurons and nerve fibers in different areas of the intervention nerve loops, and quantitative analysis was performed. Compulsive behaviour declined gradually in the QNP+AC and QNP+NAC groups 3 and 4 weeks after surgery, with the QNP+AC group decreasing more rapidly. The QNP+MD group had decreased by 3 weeks after surgery but increased to almost the same level as pre-surgery at 4 weeks post-surgery. Postoperative fluorescence staining and quantitative analysis suggested the number of dopamine (DA) neurons or nerve fibers in the corresponding target area of the 6-OHDA injection were significantly reduced compared with the QNP+Non-S group. 6-OHDA selectively damages the targets of dopaminergic neurons or nerve fibers within the OCD loop, which somewhat alleviates compulsive behaviours. The results suggest that the AC might be the best target for therapeutic interventions for OCD.",

        "title": "Unveiling serotonergic dysfunction of obsessive-compulsive disorder on prefrontal network dynamics: a computational perspective.",
        "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine is a versatile neurotransmitter with implications in many domains, including anxiety and effortful control. Where high levels of effortful control are often regarded as adaptive, other work suggests that high levels of effortful control may be a risk factor for anxiety. Dopamine signaling may be key in understanding these relations. Eye blink rate is a non-invasive proxy metric of midbrain dopamine activity. However, much work with eye blink rate has been constrained to screen-based tasks which lack in ecological validity. We tested whether changes in eye blink rate during a naturalistic effortful control task differ as a function of parent-reported effortful control and internalizing behaviors. Children played a Jenga-like game with an experimenter, but for each trial the experimenter took an increasingly long time to take their turn. Blinks-per-second were computed during each wait period. Multilevel modeling examined the relation between duration of wait period, effortful control, and internalizing behaviors on eye blink rate. We found a significant 3-way interaction between effortful control, internalizing behaviors, and duration of the wait period. Probing this interaction revealed that for children with low reported internalizing behaviors (-1 SD) and high reported effortful control (+1 SD), eye blink rate significantly decreased as they waited longer to take their turn. These findings index task-related changes in midbrain dopamine activity in relation to naturalistic task demands, and that these changes may vary as a function of individual differences in effortful control and internalizing behaviors. We discuss possible top-down mechanisms that may underlie these differences.",

We sought to delineate how DRT impacts anxiety phenomenology in PD and whether these changes are dissociable from improved motoric function. We compared anxiety responses to DRT in two cohorts: 1) a study of 200 PD participants who completed neuropsychiatric assessments before and after taking their dopaminergic medications (\"On-Off\"); 2) participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) de novo PD cohort who completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at the time of DRT initiation and a subsequent study visit (n\u00a0=\u00a0113, mean 8-month interval). Among On-Off participants transitioning acutely to the On-state, scores on the Hamilton anxiety rating scale decreased by 37% (t\u00a0=\u00a014.8, df\u00a0=\u00a0199, p <0.0001). Among PPMI participants, STAI-state scores decreased by 10.4% following DRT initiation (t\u00a0=\u00a04.5, df\u00a0=\u00a0112, p <0.0001). Item-level anxiety changes exhibited weak and nonsignificant correlations (Spearman \u03c1: -0.24 to 0.33) with objective MDS-UPDRS motor improvements in both immediate and sustained dopamine replacement contexts. Dopamine repletion effected immediate relief of anxiety in an On-Off state comparison. A similar benefit was observed in the longitudinal PPMI cohort by comparing anxiety before and after DRT initiation, suggesting DRT confers sustained anxiolytic effects in early PD. The weak correlations between improvements to anxiety and motor function on both timescales support the view that these changes are not mediated by improved motor function.",

        "abstract": "Almost 10% of the population develop depression or anxiety disorder during their lifetime. Considering that people who are exposed to high stress are more likely to develop mental disorders, it is important to detect and remove mental stress before depression or anxiety disorder develops. We aimed to develop an objective screening test that quantifies mental stress in workers so that they can recognize and remove it before the disorder develops. We obtained urine specimens from 100 healthy volunteers (49 men and 51 women; age = 48.2 \u00b1 10.8 years) after they received medical checks and answered the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). Participants were divided into high- and low- stress groups according to their total BJSQ scores. We further analyzed six urinary neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, 5-hydoroxyindoleacetic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, homovanillic acid, and vanillylmandelic acid) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to compare their levels between the two groups. We obtained the concentrations of the six analytes from 100 examinees and revealed that the levels of urinary dopamine (p = 0.0042) and homovanillic acid (p = 0.020) were significantly lower in the high-stress group than those in the low-stress group. No biases were observed between the two groups in 36 laboratory items. The stress index generated from the six neurotransmitter concentrations recognized high-stress group significantly. Moreover, we discovered that the level of each urinary neurotransmitter changed depending on various stress factors, such as dissatisfaction, physical fatigue, stomach and intestine problems, poor appetite, poor working environments, sleep disturbance, isolation, worry, or insecurity. We revealed that urinary neurotransmitters could be a promising indicator to determine underlying mental stress. This study provides clues for scientists to develop a screening test not only for workers but also for patients with depression.",

This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N\u2009=\u2009135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n\u2009=\u200964 had an OCD diagnosis. N\u2009=\u200947 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.51) and ventral tegmental area (p\u2009=\u20090.006, d\u2009=\u20090.50). Follow-up analyses indicated that more severe lifetime symptoms (t\u2009=\u2009-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and longer illness duration (t\u2009=\u2009-2.22, p\u2009=\u20090.03) related to lower neuromelanin-MRI signal. Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20091.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response.",

An inverse association has also been found between dopaminergic activity and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety in non-suicidal individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between CSF-HVA and clinical symptoms associated with an increased risk of suicide in individuals who attempted suicide. Ninety-five people (52 women; 43 men) who had recently attempted suicide received lumbar punctures to analyse levels of HVA in the CSF. They were also evaluated with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, from which scores on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Brief Scale of Anxiety (BSA), and an item on suicidal thoughts were analysed. Among female participants, CSF-HVA was significantly and negatively correlated with BSA total scores, after adjusting for covariates (beta = -0.442, p = 0.002), but not with scores on the MADRS or suicidal thought item. No significant correlations were observed between CSF-HVA and symptoms among male participants. Our findings suggest that lower dopaminergic activity may be associated with clinical symptoms of anxiety among women who have recently attempted suicide.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety that occurs in association with on-off dopamine medication fluctuations is a major cause of distress, dysfunction, and lower quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the association between anxiety and on-off fluctuations is poorly understood and it is difficult to predict which patients will suffer from this atypical form of anxiety. To understand whether fluctuating anxiety in PD exists as part of an endophenotype that is associated with other signs or symptoms, we prospectively assessed the change in anxiety and a battery of clinical variables when transitioning from the off-dopamine medication state to the on state in 200 people with PD. We performed latent profile analysis with observed variables as latent profile indicators measuring the on-off-state difference in anxiety, depression, motor function, daily functioning, and the wearing off questionnaire 19 item scale (WOQ-19) in order to model unobserved (i.e., latent) profiles. A two-class model produced the best fit. The majority of participants, 69%, were categorized as having a 'typical on-off response' compared to a second profile constituting 31% of the sample who experienced a worsening in anxiety in the off state that was three times that of other participants. This profile referred to as \"anxious fluctuators\" had a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale change between the off and on medication state of 10.22(32.85) compared to 3.27 (7.62), higher depression scores, greater disability and was less likely to improve on select WOQ-19 items when in the on-state. Anxious fluctuators were more likely to be male and have a family history of anxiety disorder. Given the adverse impact of this profile we believe it may be important to distinguish patients with a typical on-off response from those with this more problematic course of fluctuations.",

        "abstract": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is one of the major sources of dopamine in the brain and has been associated with reward prediction, error-based reward learning, volitional drive and anhedonia. However, precise anatomical investigations of the VTA have been prevented by the use of standard-resolution MRI, reliance on subjective manual tracings, and lack of quantitative measures of dopamine-related signal. Here, we combine ultra-high field 400\u00a0\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> quantitative MRI with dopamine-related signal mapping, and a mixture of machine learning and supervised computational techniques to delineate the VTA in a transdiagnostic sample of subjects with and without depression and anxiety disorders. Subjects also underwent cognitive testing to measure intrinsic and extrinsic motivational tone. Fifty-one subjects were scanned in total, including healthy control (HC) and mood/anxiety (MA) disorder subjects. MA subjects had significantly larger VTA volumes compared to HC but significantly lower signal intensity within VTA compared to HC, indicating reduced structural integrity of the dopaminergic VTA. Interestingly, while VTA integrity did not significantly correlate with self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms, it was correlated with an objective cognitive measure of extrinsic motivation, whereby lower VTA integrity was associated with lower motivation. This is the first study to demonstrate a computational pipeline for detecting and delineating the VTA in human subjects with 400\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>3</sup> resolution. We highlight the use of objective transdiagnostic measures of cognitive function that link neural integrity to behavior across clinical and non-clinical groups.",

Repetitive stereotyped behavior (e.g., grooming), a featured symptom in OCD, has been proposed to be associated with perturbed dopamine (DA) signaling. However, the precise brain circuits participating in DA's control over this behavioral phenotype remain elusive. Here, we identified that DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) orchestrate ventromedial striatum (VMS) microcircuits as well as lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) during self-grooming behavior. SNc-VMS and SNc-lOFC dopaminergic projections modulate grooming behaviors and striatal microcircuit function differentially. Specifically, the activity of the SNc-VMS pathway promotes grooming via D1 receptors, whereas the activity of the SNc-lOFC pathway suppresses grooming via D2 receptors. SNc DA neuron activity thus controls the OCD-like behaviors via both striatal and cortical projections as dual gating. These results support both pharmacological and brain-stimulation treatments for OCD.",

The present review details the physiological and pharmacological-related findings obtained from these lines. The results discussed here point towards a dysfunctional fear circuitry in CHF rats, including alterations in key brain structures and the serotoninergic system. Moreover, data from these animals highlight important alterations in the stress-processing machinery and its associated systems, such as energy metabolism and antioxidative defense. Finally, evidence of an alteration in the dopaminergic pathway in CLF rats is also debated. Thus, accumulating data gathered over the years, place the Carioca lines as significant animal models for the study of psychiatric disorders, especially fear-related ones like anxiety.",

In this multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) study, 24 patients with SAD were randomized to treatment with escitalopram+ICBT or placebo+ICBT under double-blind conditions. Before and after 9 weeks of treatment, patients were examined with positron emission tomography and the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I, probing the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporter proteins respectively. Both treatment combinations resulted in significant improvement as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). At baseline, SERT-DAT co-expression was high and, in the putamen and thalamus, co-expression showed positive associations with symptom severity. SERT-DAT co-expression was also predictive of treatment success, but predictor-outcome associations differed in direction between the treatments. After treatment, average SERT occupancy in the SSRI\u2009+\u2009ICBT group was >80%, with positive associations between symptom improvement and occupancy in the nucleus accumbens, putamen and anterior cingulate cortex. Following placebo+ICBT, SERT binding increased in the raphe nuclei. DAT binding increased in both groups in limbic and striatal areas, but relations with symptom improvement differed, being negative for SSRI\u2009+\u2009ICBT and positive for placebo\u2009+\u2009ICBT.

        "abstract": "Repeated exposure to adverse experiences in early life, termed Early Life Stress (ELS), can increase anxiety disorders later in life. Anxiety is directly associated with curiosity, a form of intrinsic drive state associated with increased novelty-seeking behaviour and risk taking for challenging opportunities and could probably modulate learning and memory. In humans, elevated curiosity during adolescence tends to elicit increased exploration, novelty seeking, high risk-taking behaviour and heightened emotionality. Such behaviours are beneficial in maintaining social skills and cognitive functions later in life. We investigated whether ELS-induced anxiety impacts curiosity-like behaviour at adolescence in an animal model. ELS was induced by subjecting Sprague Dawley rat pups to maternal separation and isolation (MS) stress during the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) from post-natal days (PND) 4-PND 14. This rat model was tested for anxiety, spontaneous exploratory behaviour and curiosity-like behaviour in a custom-designed arena during adolescence (PND 30-45). ELS-induced changes in the stress were confirmed by corticosterone, while, basal dopamine level was estimated to understand the neurochemical basis of MS stress-induced changes in curiosity. We observed an increase in the levels of anxiety and intrinsic drive state such as curiosity-like behaviour, which was associated with elevated plasma corticosterone and dopamine in MS animals during adolescence suggesting the impact of ELS during SHRP on adolescent behaviour.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition that often begins in childhood. Genetic studies in OCD have pointed to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, with evidence suggesting that increased expression contributes to risk. In mice, midbrain Slc1a1 expression supports repetitive behavior in response to dopaminergic agonists, aligning with neuroimaging and pharmacologic challenge studies that have implicated the dopaminergic system in OCD. These findings suggest that Slc1a1 may contribute to compulsive behavior through altered dopaminergic transmission; however, this theory has not been mechanistically tested. To examine the developmental impact of Slc1a1 overexpression on compulsive-like behaviors, we, therefore, generated a novel mouse model to perform targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in dopaminergic neurons. Mice with life-long overexpression of Slc1a1 showed a significant increase in amphetamine (AMPH)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that Slc1a1 overexpression was associated with increased firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dLight1.1 fiber photometry showed that these behavioral abnormalities were associated with increased dorsal striatum dopamine release. In contrast, no impact of overexpression was observed on anxiety-like behaviors or SKF-38393-induced grooming. Importantly, overexpression solely in adulthood failed to recapitulate these behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that overexpression during development is necessary to generate AMPH-induced phenotypes. However, doxycycline-induced reversal of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression in adulthood normalized both the increased dopaminergic firing and AMPH-induced responses. These data indicate that the pathologic effects of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression on dopaminergic neurotransmission and AMPH-induced stereotyped behavior are developmentally mediated, and support normalization of EAAT3 activity as a potential treatment target for basal ganglia-mediated repetitive behaviors.",

To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set.

In this randomized clinical trial of participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) we investigated how manipulation of verbally-induced expectancies, vital for placebo response, affect brain monoamine transporters and symptom improvement during SSRI treatment. Twenty-seven participants with SAD (17 men, 10 women), were randomized, to 9 weeks of overt or covert treatment with escitalopram 20\u2009mg. The overt group received correct treatment information whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with escitalopram, described as an active placebo in a cover story. Before and after treatment, patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) assessments with the [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I radiotracers, probing brain serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporters. SAD symptoms were measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Overt was superior to covert SSRI treatment, resulting in almost a fourfold higher rate of responders. PET results showed that SERT occupancy after treatment was unrelated to anxiety reduction and equally high in both groups. In contrast, DAT binding decreased in the right putamen, pallidum, and the left thalamus with overt SSRI treatment, and increased with covert treatment, resulting in significant group differences. DAT binding potential changes in these regions correlated negatively with symptom improvement. Findings support that the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs involve psychological factors contingent on dopaminergic neurotransmission while serotonin transporter blockade alone is insufficient for clinical response.",

        "abstract": "Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",

        "abstract": "Dopamine is essential to many functions like reward, motivation, and attention; when its neural pathways do not function properly, various disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, compulsions) can arise. Truncated-DAT rats display persistent stereotypies and aggressiveness; hence they are a new valuable animal model to study the pathogenesis of these disorders. The focus of research is often on the individual epigenetic determinants and much less on the impact of social experiences. Here, we investigate the developmental impact of the social environment on adolescent wild type (WT) rats. We divided subjects at weaning into three groups: living with another adolescent (WT Peer), with a WT adult, or with a truncated-DAT one, and we observed homecage social behavior of these pairs (play, jump, victory, and \"bullying\") during whole adolescence. When adult, we observed the same subjects in plus maze, forced swim, and social preference tests to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and quality of social interactions. Compared to the other groups, WT rats that had spent their adolescence with a truncated-DAT adult as companion show more anxious, depressive, hyperactive, impulsive, and compulsive behaviours. Results confirm that social interactions and healthy play (i.e., when play has behavioural, social, and psychomotor rewards that support the cognitive, emotional and physical development of the individual) are essential to neurobehavioral maturation. Conversely, anomalous interactions like poor play and \"bullying\" in developing rats may impact onto their dopaminergic system. Consequently, an impoverished social play could be one of the factors contributing to the appearance of putative indexes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and\\or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",

        "title": "Disruption of prepulse inhibition is associated with compulsive behavior severity and nucleus accumbens dopamine receptor changes in Sapap3 knockout mice.",
        "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with disruption of sensorimotor gating, which may contribute to difficulties inhibiting intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals. Neural mechanisms underlying these disturbances are unclear; however, striatal dopamine is implicated in regulation of sensorimotor gating and OCD pathophysiology. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between sensorimotor gating, compulsive behavior, and striatal dopamine receptor levels in Sapap3 knockout mice (KOs), a widely used preclinical model system for OCD research. We found a trend for disruption of sensorimotor gating in Sapap3-KOs using the translational measure prepulse inhibition (PPI); however, there was significant heterogeneity in both PPI and compulsive grooming in KOs. Disruption of PPI was significantly correlated with a more severe compulsive phenotype. In addition, PPI disruption and compulsive grooming severity were associated with reduced dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC). Compulsive grooming progressively worsened in Sapap3-KOs tested longitudinally, but PPI disruption was first detected in high-grooming KOs at 7\u00a0months of age. Through detailed characterization of individual differences in OCD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical measures, our findings suggest that NAcC dopamine receptor changes may be involved in disruption of sensorimotor gating and compulsive behavior relevant to OCD.",

        "title": "Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD.",
        "abstract": "Effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments are well established for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are first-line treatment and are of benefit to about half of patients. Augmentation of SRI treatment with low-dose neuroleptics is an evidence-based second-line strategy. Specialty psychotherapy is also used as both first-line and second-line treatment and can benefit many. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to these treatments. New alternatives are urgently needed. This review summarizes evidence for these established pharmacotherapeutic strategies, and for others that have been investigated in refractory disease but are not supported by the same level of evidence. We focus on three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We summarize evidence from genetic, neuroimaging, animal model, and other lines of investigation that probe these three systems in patients with OCD. We also review recent work on predictors of response to current treatments. While many studies suggest abnormalities that may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, most studies have been small, and non-replication of reported findings has been common. Nevertheless, the gradual accrual of evidence for neurotransmitter dysregulation may in time lead the way to new pharmacological strategies.",

        "abstract": "This paper seeks to describe anxiety's different symptomatologic presentations in Parkinson's disease (PD), its longitudinal course and predictors, as well as its motor and non-motor correlates. It also reviews the available screening tools and different treatment modalities. In PD, longitudinal predictors of anxiety are mostly non-motor non-dopaminergic symptoms. The longitudinal course of anxiety is mainly a stable one. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Scale are the 2 recommended screening tools. A third of PD patients suffer from an anxiety disorder at any time point. It can precede or follow PD motor symptoms. Anxiety is associated with demographic, disease-related motor and non-motor features. There is a lack of studies evaluating psychotropic treatment of anxiety in PD. Adjustment of dopaminergic treatment is indicated when anxiety is associated with motor fluctuations. DBS can be useful as well as CBT and body-mind interventions.",

        "abstract": "Checking is a functional behaviour that provides information to guide behaviour. However, in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), checking may escalate to dysfunctional levels. The processes underpinning the transition from functional to dysfunctional checking are unclear but may be associated with individual differences that support the development of maladaptive behaviour. We examined one such predisposition, sign-tracking to a pavlovian conditioned stimulus, which we previously found associated with dysfunctional checking. How sign-tracking interacts with another treatment with emerging translational validity for OCD-like checking, chronic administration of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist quinpirole, is unknown. We tested how functional and dysfunctional checking in the rat observing response task (ORT) was affected by chronic quinpirole administration in non-autoshaped controls and autoshaped animals classified as sign-trackers or goal-trackers. Sign-trackers or goal-trackers were trained on the ORT before the effects of chronic quinpirole administration on checking were assessed. Subsequently, the effects on checking of different behavioural challenges, including reward omission and the use of unpredictable reinforcement schedules, were tested. Prior autoshaping increased checking. Sign-trackers and goal-trackers responded differently to quinpirole sensitization, reward omission and reinforcement uncertainty. Sign-trackers showed greater elevations in dysfunctional checking, particularly during uncertainty. By contrast, goal-trackers predominantly increased functional checking responses, possibly in response to reduced discrimination accuracy in the absence of cues signalling which lever was currently active. The results are discussed in terms of how pavlovian associations influence behaviour that becomes compulsive in OCD and how this may be dependent on striatal dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors.",

        "title": "Biological and Clinical Markers to Differentiate the Type of Anxiety Disorders.",
        "abstract": "The present chapter is an overview of possible biomarkers which distinguish anxiety disorders as classified by the DSM-5. Structural or activity changes in the brain regions; changes in N-acetylaspartate/creatine, dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin; hearth rate variability; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity; error-related negativity; respiratory regulation; and genetic variants are proposed. However, their clinical utility is questionable due to low specificity and sensitivity: the majority does not distinguish subjects with different anxiety disorders, and they might be influenced by stress, comorbidity, physical activity, and psychotropic medications. In this framework, the staging model, a clinimetric tool which allows to define the degree of progression of a disease at a point in time and where the patient is located on the continuum of the course of the disease, is proposed since several DSM anxiety disorders take place at different stages of the same syndrome according to the staging model. Thus, a stage-specific biomarker model for anxiety disorders is hypothesized and illustrated.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin and dopamine are putatively involved in the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders, but positron emission tomography (PET) studies probing the two neurotransmitters in the same individuals are lacking. The aim of this multitracer PET study was to evaluate the regional expression and co-expression of the transporter proteins for serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Voxel-wise binding potentials (BP<sub>ND</sub>) for SERT and DAT were determined in 27 patients with SAD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, using the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB (3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile) and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I (N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)nortropane). Results showed that, within transmitter systems, SAD patients exhibited higher SERT binding in the nucleus accumbens while DAT availability in the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen correlated positively with symptom severity. At a more lenient statistical threshold, SERT and DAT BP<sub>ND</sub> were also higher in other striatal and limbic regions in patients, and correlated with symptom severity, whereas no brain region showed higher binding in healthy controls. Moreover, SERT/DAT co-expression was significantly higher in SAD patients in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and posterior ventral thalamus, while lower co-expression was noted in the dorsomedial thalamus. Follow-up logistic regression analysis confirmed that SAD diagnosis was significantly predicted by the statistical interaction between SERT and DAT availability, in the amygdala, putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Thus, SAD was associated with mainly increased expression and co-expression of the transporters for serotonin and dopamine in fear and reward-related brain regions. Resultant monoamine dysregulation may underlie SAD symptomatology and constitute a target for treatment.",
