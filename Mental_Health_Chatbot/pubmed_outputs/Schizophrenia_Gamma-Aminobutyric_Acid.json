        "abstract": "The aim of this research was to characterize changes in peripheral blood neurotransmitter metabolites in olanzapine-treated schizophrenia (SCZ) and to identify potential biomarkers for SCZ. Concurrently, the relationship between these differential neurotransmitters and cognitive function is explored. We recruited 40 SCZ treated with single-agent olanzapine and 40 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive function and psychopathology were assessed using the MCCB and PANSS, respectively. Neurotransmitter levels were determined by targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). SCZ showed cognitive impairment in all domains of the MCCB compared to HC. Interestingly, a 4-neurotransmitter panel consisting of 3-Methoxytyramine hydrochloride (3-MT), 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetate (DOPAC), arginine, and r-aminobutyric acid (GABA) illustrated the highest determinative score between SCZ and HC. Arginine was positively correlated with PANSS general psychopathology scores. 3-MT independently predicted the verbal learning scores only in SCZ, whereas GABA independently predicted the social cognition scores only. Furthermore, GABA independently predicted the working memory scores only in HC. The collective assessment of these four neurotransmitters (3-MT, DOPAC, arginine, and GABA) holds considerable promise as potential biomarkers for SCZ. Moreover, 3-MT and GABA may enhance our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ, particularly in areas of verbal learning and social cognitive dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Treatment-resistance in patients with schizophrenia is a major obstacle for improving outcome in patients, especially in those not gaining from clozapine. Novel research implies that glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities may be present in treatment-resistant patients, and preclinical research suggests that clozapine affects the GABAergic system. Moreover, clozapine may have a neuroprotective role. To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relationship between clozapine and in vivo measures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (glu), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) brain levels in treatment- and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (TRS and UTRS). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we included three longitudinal and six cross sectional studies utilizing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) that explored brain metabolite levels in clozapine-treated patients. Findings were limited by a small number of studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn, but the present studies may imply that clozapine reduces glutamate levels in striatal but not cortical areas, whereas glutamatergic metabolites and GABA levels may be increased in ACC in the combined group of TRS and UTRS. Clozapine may also increase NAA in cortical areas. Importantly, this review highlights the need for further clinical studies investigating the effect of clozapine on brain levels of glutamate, GABA, and NAA as well as metabolite group differences in patients with UTRS compared with TRS.",

        "abstract": "The microbiome has been linked to numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. Nevertheless, correlating microbial perturbations to pathophysiological aspects of schizophrenia remains elusive, as study participants are typically medicated when sampled, complicating mechanistic investigation. Here we explored specific microbial and metabolic alterations in schizophrenia patients, while explicitly considering their medications. We recruited 30 patients and 14 healthy controls. Fecal and serum samples were collected for microbiota and (untargeted) metabolome characterization, respectively. While significant differences were detected between microbiome of controls and schizophrenia patients overall, patients not taking GABA-enhancing drugs had profiles similar to the control group. This pattern was preserved, but to a lesser extent, when comparing metabolomes. Several key metabolic pathways differed between patients and controls, even after filtering out those directly related to pharmaceuticals and their metabolism, and the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis pathways were enriched in the group prescribed antipsychotics without GABA-enhancers. Administration of exogenous GABA affected overall patient homeostasis, not just disease course, supporting our hypothesis that microbiota play a part in cognitive, emotional, and mental function, and that this role must be considered in the full context of an individual's state, including medication.",

        "abstract": "Zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) was the first genome-wide associated susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (SCZ) and played an essential role in the pathophysiology of SCZ by influencing neurodevelopment regulation, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and RNA translational control; however, the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. A nervous-system-specific Zfp804a (ZNF804A murine gene) conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 technology and the Cre/loxP method. Multiple and complex SCZ-like behaviors, such as anxiety, depression, and impaired cognition, were observed in Zfp804a cKO mice. Molecular biological methods and targeted metabolomics assay validated that Zfp804a cKO mice displayed altered SATB2 (a cortical superficial neuron marker) expression in the cortex; aberrant NeuN, cleaved caspase 3, and DLG4 (markers of mature neurons, apoptosis, and postsynapse, respectively) expressions in the hippocampus and a loss of glutamate (Glu)/\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) homeostasis with abnormal GAD67 (Gad1) expression in the hippocampus. Clozapine partly ameliorated some SCZ-like behaviors, reversed the disequilibrium of the Glu/GABA ratio, and recovered the expression of GAD67 in cKO mice. Zfp804a cKO mice reproducing SCZ-like pathological and behavioral phenotypes were successfully developed. A novel mechanism was determined in which Zfp804a caused Glu/GABA imbalance and reduced GAD67 expression, which was partly recovered by clozapine treatment. These findings underscore the role of altered gene expression in understanding the pathogenesis of SCZ and provide a reliable SCZ model for future therapeutic interventions and biomarker discovery.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neuropsychiatric disorder, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The etiology behind the disorder remains elusive although it is hypothesized to be associated with the aberrant response to neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate. Therefore, investigating the link between dysregulated metabolites and distorted neurodevelopment holds promise to offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of this complex disorder. In this study, we aimed to explore a presumed correlation between the transcriptome and the metabolome in a SCZ model based on patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For this, iPSCs were differentiated towards cortical neurons and samples were collected longitudinally at various developmental stages, reflecting neuroepithelial-like cells, radial glia, young and mature neurons. The samples were analyzed by both RNA-sequencing and targeted metabolomics and the two modalities were used to construct integrative networks in silico. This multi-omics analysis revealed significant perturbations in the polyamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthetic pathways during rosette maturation in SCZ lines. We particularly observed the downregulation of the glutamate decarboxylase\u00a0encoding genes GAD1\u00a0and GAD2, as well as\u00a0their protein product GAD65/67 and their biochemical product GABA in SCZ samples. Inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase resulted in further decrease of GABA levels suggesting a compensatory activation of the ornithine/putrescine pathway as an alternative route for GABA production. These findings indicate an imbalance of cortical excitatory/inhibitory dynamics occurring during early neurodevelopmental stages in SCZ. Our study supports the hypothesis of disruption of inhibitory circuits to be causative for SCZ and establishes a novel in silico approach that enables for integrative correlation of metabolic and transcriptomic data of psychiatric disease models.",

Consequently, we investigated in patients with SSD and healthy controls (HC) the relations between (1) plasma concentrations of two prototypical endocannabinoids (N-arachidonoylethanolamine [anandamide] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) and (2) striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), and glutamate and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As anandamide and 2-AG might reduce the activity of these neurotransmitters, we hypothesized negative correlations between their plasma levels and the abovementioned neurotransmitters in both groups. Blood samples were obtained from 18 patients and 16 HC to measure anandamide and 2-AG plasma concentrations. For all subjects, we acquired proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans to assess Glx (i.e. glutamate plus glutamine) and GABA + (i.e. GABA plus macromolecules) concentrations in the ACC. Ten patients and 14 HC also underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DOPA positron emission tomography for assessment of striatal DSC. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relations between the outcome measures. A negative association between 2-AG plasma concentration and ACC Glx concentration was found in patients (<i>p</i> = 0.008). We found no evidence of other significant relationships between 2-AG or anandamide plasma concentrations and dopaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic measures in either group.

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of schizophrenia begins in early neurodevelopment and leads to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. It is therefore essential that preclinical models used to understand disease, select drug targets and evaluate novel therapeutics encompass similar neurochemical deficits. One approach to improved preclinical modelling incorporates dual-hit neurodevelopmental insults, like neonatal administration of phencyclidine (PCP, to disrupt development of glutamatergic circuitry) then post-weaning isolation (Iso, to mimic adolescent social stress). We recently showed that male Lister-hooded rats exposed to PCP-Iso exhibit reduced hippocampal expression of the GABA interneuron marker calbindin. The current study expanded on this by investigating changes to additional populations of GABAergic interneurons in frontal cortical and hippocampal tissue from the same animals (by immunohistochemistry) as well as levels of GABA itself (via ELISA). Because inflammatory changes are also implicated in schizophrenia, we performed additional immunohistochemical evaluations of Iba-1 positive microglia as well as ELISA analysis of IL-6 in the same brain regions. Single-hit isolation-reared and dual-hit PCP-Iso rats both showed reduced parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the prelimbic/infralimbic region of the frontal cortex. However, this was more widespread in PCP-Iso, extending to the medial/ventral and lateral/dorsolateral orbitofrontal cortices. Loss of GABAergic markers was accompanied by increased microglial activation in the medial/ventral orbitofrontal cortices of PCP-Iso, together with frontal cortical IL-6 elevations not seen following single-hit isolation rearing. These findings enhance the face validity of PCP-Iso, and we advocate the use of this preclinical model for future evaluation of novel therapeutics-especially those designed to normalise excitatory-inhibitory imbalance or reduce neuroinflammation.",

        "abstract": "Deficient gamma oscillations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of individuals with schizophrenia appear to involve impaired inhibitory drive from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs). Inhibitory drive from PVIs is regulated, in part, by RNA binding fox-1 homolog 1 (Rbfox1). Rbfox1 is spliced into nuclear or cytoplasmic isoforms, which regulate alternative splicing or stability of their target transcripts, respectively. One major target of cytoplasmic Rbfox1 is vesicle associated membrane protein 1 (Vamp1). Vamp1 mediates GABA release probability from PVIs, and the loss of Rbfox1 reduces Vamp1 levels which in turn impairs cortical inhibition. In this study, we investigated if the Rbfox1-Vamp1 pathway is altered in PVIs in PFC of individuals with schizophrenia by utilizing a novel strategy that combines multi-label in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In the PFC of 20 matched pairs of schizophrenia and comparison subjects, cytoplasmic Rbfox1 protein levels were significantly lower in PVIs in schizophrenia and this deficit was not attributable to potential methodological confounds or schizophrenia-associated co-occurring factors. In a subset of this cohort, Vamp1 mRNA levels in PVIs were also significantly lower in schizophrenia and were predicted by lower cytoplasmic Rbfox1 protein levels across individual PVIs. To investigate the functional impact of Rbfox1-Vamp1 alterations in schizophrenia, we simulated the effect of lower GABA release probability from PVIs on gamma power in a computational model network of pyramidal neurons and PVIs. Our simulations showed that lower GABA release probability reduces gamma power by disrupting network synchrony while minimally affecting network activity. Finally, lower GABA release probability synergistically interacted with lower strength of inhibition from PVIs in schizophrenia to reduce gamma power non-linearly. Together, our findings suggest that the Rbfox1-Vamp1 pathway in PVIs is impaired in schizophrenia and that this alteration likely contributes to deficient PFC gamma power in the illness.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies reported decreased glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis. However, ACC glutamatergic changes in subjects at high-risk for psychosis, and the effects of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function in adolescents remain unclear. In this study, adolescents recruited from the general population underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the pregenual ACC using a 3-Tesla scanner. We explored longitudinal data on the association of combined glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels, measured by MRS, with subclinical psychotic experiences. Moreover, we investigated associations of bullying victimization, a risk factor for subclinical psychotic experiences, and help-seeking intentions, a coping strategy against stressors including bullying victimization, with Glx levels. Finally, path analyses were conducted to explore multivariate associations. For a contrast analysis, gamma-aminobutyric acid plus macromolecule (GABA+) levels were also analyzed. Negative associations were found between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences at both Times 1 (n\u2009=\u2009219, mean age 11.5\u2009y) and 2 (n\u2009=\u2009211, mean age 13.6\u2009y), as well as for over-time changes (n\u2009=\u2009157, mean interval 2.0\u2009y). Moreover, effects of bullying victimization and bullying victimization \u00d7 help-seeking intention interaction effects on Glx levels were found (n\u2009=\u2009156). Specifically, bullying victimization decreased Glx levels, whereas help-seeking intention increased Glx levels only in bullied adolescents. Finally, associations among bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences were revealed. GABA+ analysis revealed no significant results. This is the first adolescent study to reveal longitudinal trajectories of the association between glutamatergic function and subclinical psychotic experiences and to elucidate the effect of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function. Our findings may deepen the understanding of how environmental emotional/social stressors induce impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission that could be the underpinning of liability for psychotic experiences in early adolescence.",

GABA interneuron deficiency is locally expressed in the form of neural activity desynchronization. We mapped the functional anatomy of local synchrony in the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia using functional connectivity MRI. Data from 86 patients with schizophrenia and 137 control subjects were obtained from publicly available repositories. Resting-state functional connectivity maps based on Iso-Distant Average Correlation measures across three distances were estimated detailing the local functional structure of the cerebral cortex. Patients with schizophrenia showed weaker local functional connectivity (i.e., lower MRI signal synchrony) in (i) prefrontal lobe areas, (ii) somatosensory, auditory, visual, and motor cortices, (iii) paralimbic system at the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and (iv) hippocampus. The distribution of the defect in cortical area synchrony largely coincided with the synchronization effect of the GABA agonist alprazolam previously observed using identical functional connectivity measures. There was also a notable resemblance between the anatomy of our findings and cortical areas showing higher density of parvalbumin (prefrontal lobe and sensory cortices) and somatostatin (anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex) GABA interneurons in humans. Our results thus provide detail of the functional anatomy of synchrony changes in the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia and suggest which elements of the interneuron system are affected.

        "abstract": "Clozapine is an effective antipsychotic for the treatment of antipsychotic-resistant schizophrenia; however, specific types of A/B adverse effects and clozapine-discontinuation syndromes are also well known. To date, both the critical mechanisms of clinical actions (effective for antipsychotic-resistant schizophrenia) and the adverse effects of clozapine remain to be elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated that clozapine increased the synthesis of L-\u03b2-aminoisobutyric acid (L-BAIBA) in the hypothalamus. L-BAIBA is an activator of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), glycine receptor, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>B</sub>-R). These targets of L-BAIBA overlap as potential targets other than the monoamine receptors of clozapine. However, the direct binding of clozapine to these aminoacidic transmitter/modulator receptors remains to be clarified. Therefore, to explore the contribution of increased L-BAIBA on the clinical action of clozapine, this study determined the effects of clozapine and L-BAIBA on tripartite synaptic transmission, including GABA<sub>B</sub>-R and the group-III metabotropic glutamate receptor (III-mGluR) using cultured astrocytes, as well as on the thalamocortical hyper-glutamatergic transmission induced by impaired glutamate/NMDA receptors using microdialysis. Clozapine increased astroglial L-BAIBA synthesis in time/concentration-dependent manners. Increased L-BAIBA synthesis was observed until 3 days after clozapine discontinuation. Clozapine did not directly bind III-mGluR or GABA<sub>B</sub>-R, whereas L-BAIBA activated these receptors in the astrocytes. Local administration of MK801 into the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) increased L-glutamate release in the medial frontal cortex (mPFC) (MK801-evoked L-glutamate release). Local administration of L-BAIBA into the mPFC suppressed MK801-evoked L-glutamate release. These actions of L-BAIBA were inhibited by antagonists of III-mGluR and GABA<sub>B</sub>-R, similar to clozapine. These in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that increased frontal L-BAIBA signaling likely plays an important role in the pharmacological actions of clozapine, such as improving the effectiveness of treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia and several clozapine discontinuation syndromes via the activation of III-mGluR and GABA<sub>B</sub>-R in the mPFC.",

Investigating the aberrant neurotransmitter processes reflected by alterations identified using multiomics analysis is valuable to fully explain the pathogenesis of SCZ. We conducted an integrative analysis of multiomics data, including the serum metabolome, fecal metagenome, single nucleotide polymorphism data, and neuroimaging data obtained from a cohort of 127 drug-na\u00efve, first-episode SCZ patients and 92 healthy controls to characterize the microbiome-gut-brain axis in SCZ patients. We used pathway-based polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses to determine the biological pathways contributing to genetic risk and mediation effect analyses to determine the important neuroimaging features. Additionally, a random forest model was generated for effective SCZ diagnosis. We found that the altered metabolome and dysregulated microbiome were associated with neuroactive metabolites, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tryptophan, and short-chain fatty acids. Further structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses highlighted that gray matter volume and functional connectivity disturbances mediate the relationships between Ruminococcus_torgues and Collinsella_aerofaciens and symptom severity and the relationships between species Lactobacillus_ruminis and differential metabolites l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid and N-acetylserotonin and cognitive function. Moreover, analyses of the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) support that alterations in GABA and tryptophan neurotransmitter pathways are associated with SCZ risk, and GABA might be a more dominant contributor.

However, the relative magnitude, location within the depth of the DLPFC, and specificity to the disease process of schizophrenia of alterations in GAD67 and/or GAD65 remain unclear. Levels of GAD67 and GAD65 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in superficial (layers 2/superficial 3) and deep (deep layer 6/white matter) zones of the DLPFC were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in subjects with schizophrenia (n\u00a0= 41), major depression (n\u00a0= 42), or bipolar disorder (n\u00a0= 39) and unaffected comparison (n\u00a0= 43) subjects. Relative to the unaffected comparison group, GAD67 and GAD65 mRNA levels in the schizophrenia group were lower (p\u00a0= .039, effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.69 and p\u00a0= .027, effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.72, respectively) in the superficial zone but were unaltered in the deep zone. In the major depression group, only GAD67 mRNA levels were lower and only in the superficial zone (p\u00a0= .089, effect size\u00a0= 0.70). No differences were detected in the bipolar disorder group. Neither GAD67 nor GAD65 mRNA alterations were explained by psychosis, mood disturbance, or common comorbid factors. Alterations in markers of GABA synthesis demonstrated transcript, DLPFC zone, and diagnostic specificity. Given the dependence of WM on GABA neurotransmission in the superficial DLPFC, our findings suggest that limitations to GABA synthesis in this location contribute to WM impairments in schizophrenia, especially during demanding WM tasks, when GABA synthesis requires the activity of both GAD67 and GAD65.",

        "title": "Laminar-Specific Alterations in Calbindin-Positive Boutons in the Prefrontal Cortex of Subjects With Schizophrenia.",
        "abstract": "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with altered GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). GABA neurotransmission requires GABA synthesis by 2 isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) and packaging by the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT). Current postmortem findings suggest that GAD67 messenger RNA is lower in a subset of the calbindin-expressing (CB+) class of GABA neurons in schizophrenia. Hence, we assessed if CB+ GABA neuron boutons are affected in schizophrenia. For 20 matched pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and unaffected comparison subjects, PFC tissue sections were immunolabeled for vGAT, CB, GAD67, and GAD65. The density of CB+ GABA boutons and levels of the 4 proteins per bouton were quantified. Some CB+ GABA boutons contained both GAD65 and GAD67 (GAD65+/GAD67+), whereas others contained only GAD65 (GAD65+) or GAD67 (GAD67+). In schizophrenia, vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+/GAD67+ bouton density was not altered, vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+ bouton density was 86% higher in layers 2/superficial 3 (L2/3s), and vGAT+/CB+/GAD67+ bouton density was 36% lower in L5-6. Bouton GAD levels were differentially altered across bouton types and layers. In schizophrenia, the sum of GAD65 and GAD67 levels in vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+/GAD67+ boutons was 36% lower in L6, GAD65 levels were 51% higher in vGAT+/CB+/GAD65+ boutons in L2, and GAD67 levels in vGAT+/CB+/GAD67+ boutons were 30% to 46% lower in L2/3s-6. These findings indicate that schizophrenia-associated alterations in the strength of inhibition from CB+ GABA neurons in the PFC differ across cortical layers and bouton classes, suggesting complex contributions to PFC dysfunction and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Converging lines of evidence suggest that an imbalance between excitation and inhibition is present in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of schizophrenia (SCZ). Gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) and, to a lesser extent, glutamate (Glu) abnormalities were reported in the DLPFC of SCZ patients, especially on the right hemisphere, by post-mortem studies. However, in vivo evidence of GABA, Glu, and Glu/GABA DLPFC abnormalities, particularly on the right side and the early stages of illness, is limited. In this preliminary study, we utilized 7-Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to investigate bilateral Glu/Creatine (Cre), GABA/Cre, and Glu/GABA in the DLPFC of sixteen first episode schizophrenia (FES), seventeen clinical high risk (CHR), and twenty-six healthy comparison (HC) subjects. FES and CHR had abnormal GABA/Cre and Glu/GABA in the right DLPFC (rDLPFC) compared with HC participants, while no differences were observed in the left DLPFC (lDLPFC) among the three groups. Furthermore, HC had higher Glu/GABA in rDLPFC compared to lDLPFC (R > L), whereas the opposite relationship (R < L) was observed in the DLPFC Glu/GABA of FES patients. Altogether, these findings indicate that GABA/Cre and Glu/GABA DLPFC alterations are present before illness manifestation and worsen in FES patients, thus representing a putative early pathophysiological biomarker for SCZ and related psychotic disorders.",

        "title": "Neurofunctional correlates of glutamate and GABA imbalance in psychosis: A systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Glutamatergic and GABAergic dysfunction are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous work has shown relationships between glutamate, GABA, and brain activity in healthy volunteers. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether these relationships are disrupted in psychosis. Primary outcomes were the relationship between metabolite levels and fMRI BOLD response in psychosis relative to healthy volunteers. 17 case-control studies met inclusion criteria (594 patients and 538 healthy volunteers). Replicated findings included that in psychosis, positive associations between ACC glutamate levels and brain activity are reduced during resting state conditions and increased during cognitive control tasks, and negative relationships between GABA and local activation in the ACC are reduced. There was evidence that antipsychotic medication may alter the relationship between glutamate levels and brain activity. Emerging literature is providing insights into disrupted relationships between neurometabolites and brain activity in psychosis. Future studies determining a link to clinical variables may develop this approach for biomarker applications, including development or targeting novel therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. However, the detailed metabolic profile changes in the progression of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms are still not fully elucidated. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based untargeted hippocampus high-throughput metabolomics method was first performed to screen for potential biomarkers in a schizophrenia-like state in a chronically administered ketamine-induced mouse model. Our results identified that the amino acid and energy metabolism pathways were significantly affected in mouse models of ketamine-induced schizophrenia. The detailed amino acid profiles were subsequently quantified in the hippocampus. The results showed that ketamine dramatically decreased the Lys, Gly, and Ser levels while significantly increasing the Gln level and relative Glu-to-GABA ratio. Our study suggested that Gln, Gly and Ser metabolism disturbances might be involved in ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like phenotypes. This research offers a fresh viewpoint for creating new neuroleptic medications and contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying ketamine-induced schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive impairments, the main determinants of functional outcomes in schizophrenia, had limited treatment responses and need a better understanding of the mechanisms. Dysfunctions of the dopamine system and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the primary pathophysiologies of schizophrenia, may impair cognition. This study explored the effects and interactions of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and plasma NMDAR-related amino acids on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. We recruited 36 schizophrenia patients and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent cognitive assessments of attention, memory, and executive function. Single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT and ultra-performance liquid chromatography were applied to determine DAT availability and plasma concentrations of eight amino acids, respectively. Compared with HC, schizophrenia patients had lower cognitive performance, higher methionine concentrations, decreased concentrations of glutamic acid, cysteine, aspartic acid, arginine, the ratio of glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid (Glu/GABA), and DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen. Regarding memory scores, Glu/GABA and the DAT availability in left CN and putamen exhibited positive relationships, while methionine concentrations showed negative associations in all participants. The DAT availability in left CN mediated the methionine-memory relationship. An exploratory backward stepwise regression analysis for the four biological markers associated with memory indicated that DAT availability in left CN and Glu/GABA remained in the final model. This study demonstrated the interactions of striatal DAT and NMDAR-related amino acids on cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Future studies to comprehensively evaluate their complex interactions and treatment implications are warranted.",
