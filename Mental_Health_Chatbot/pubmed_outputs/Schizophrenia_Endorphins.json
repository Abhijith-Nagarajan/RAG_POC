        "title": "Plasma neuropeptide levels in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder and healthy controls: A multiplex immunoassay study.",
        "abstract": "We aimed to compare neuropeptide levels between patients with major psychiatric disorders and healthy controls and examine their association with symptoms and cognitive function. The participants were 149 patients with schizophrenia, 115 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 186 unremitted patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 350 healthy controls. Psychiatric (schizophrenic, manic, and depressive) symptoms, sleep state, and cognitive (premorbid intelligence quotient, general cognitive, and memory) functions were evaluated. A multiplex immunoassay kit was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels. The verification assay revealed that CSF \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were too low to be reliably measured, while plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels could be successfully measured. Plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and healthy controls. Plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and cognitive function scores in patients or healthy controls. Our data suggest that plasma neuropeptide levels do not elucidate the involvement of neuropeptides in the pathology of schizophrenia, BD, or MDD.",

        "title": "Plasma \u03b2-Endorphin Concentration and Antipsychotic Treatment Outcome in Schizophrenia: 1-Year Follow-Up.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Increased levels of endogenous opioids have been observed in patients with schizophrenia; however, the influence of these endogenous opioids on the biology of schizophrenia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of beta-endorphin (BE) on the course of schizophrenia and risk of relapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 25 patients hospitalized with schizophrenia and 47 controls. Their symptoms were evaluated using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and composite index at five points: at the onset of hospitalization; after 4, 6 and 10 weeks of treatment; and after 12 months. \u00df-endorphin plasma concentrations were assessed in patients at study enrollment and after 6 weeks of treatment. Data regarding rehospitalization during follow-up were also collected. RESULTS Patients had higher BE concentration than controls at study enrollment (P=0.002) and after 6 weeks (P=0.000). BE levels increased during treatment (mean 0.538ng/mL vs. mean 0.624 ng/mL; P=0.007). No correlation was found between BE concentration and PANSS subscale score at any stage of the study. A higher BE level at study enrollment was related to a predominance of negative symptoms after 1 year, measured with composite index (R=-0.404; P=0.045). Patients who were later hospitalized again were significantly more likely to demonstrate an increase in BE levels over 6 weeks (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated higher BE concentrations than healthy controls; this tendency was particularly apparent in those affected by negative symptoms. The imbalance in the endogenous opioid system might adversely alter the course of disease and predispose patients to persistence of negative symptoms, despite antipsychotic treatment.",

        "abstract": "The odor identification ability and its hedonic judgment in patients with schizophrenia were evaluated in the study. The association between olfactory performance and negative symptoms and \u03b2-endorphin concentration was also analyzed. Study groups consisted of 23 patients with negative symptoms (PN) and 25 without predominant negative symptoms (PP) and 21 healthy individuals. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, odor hedonic evaluation, and plasma concentrations of \u03b2-endorphin assay in all participants were performed. PN perceived the poorer olfactory identification; nevertheless, they evaluated unpleasant odors as more pleasant than PP and controls. Beta-endorphin concentration was significantly higher among PN than in other study groups. No association was observed between \u03b2-endorphin and odors identification and odor hedonic judgment among all study groups. There is potential relationship between increased \u03b2-endorphin concentration and severity of negative symptoms. Patients with predominant negative symptoms tend to evaluate odors as significantly more pleasant. Individuals with this subtype of schizophrenia might present specific, altered pattern of smell identification and hedonic judgment. Presumably, \u03b2-endorphin has no direct influence on olfactory identification performance and hedonic judgment in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between the olfactory system and emotional processing is an area of growing interest in schizophrenia research. Both the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in the processing of olfactory information, and olfactory deficits may be also influenced by endogenous opioids and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is probably involved in dopaminergic transmission. However, the relationship between endorphins and dopaminergic transmission has not been fully explored. Odor identification performance and valence interaction was evaluated among 50 schizophrenic patients and 50 controls. Schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). All study participants were subjected to the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), blood \u03b2-endorphin (BE) and CGRP measurement. Insignificantly higher BE concentrations were observed in the patient group, while significantly higher UPSIT scores were seen in controls (mean UPSIT 32.48 vs 26.82). The patients demonstrated significantly more identification errors for pleasant (P=0.000) and neutral (P=0.055) odors than for unpleasant odors. Patients with higher BE concentrations made more identification errors concerning pleasant (R<sub>s</sub>=-0.292; P=0.04) and neutral odors (R<sub>s</sub>=-0.331; P=0.019). Although the concentration of CGRP was significantly higher in the patient sample (P<0.001), no relationship was observed between concentration and UPSIT performance. A strong negative correlation was observed between PANSS N score and UPSIT total score (R<sub>s</sub>=-0.646; P=0.000), between PANSS N score and identification by valence for pleasant and neutral odors (UPSIT n/16: R<sub>s</sub>=-0.450, P=0.001; UPSIT n/15: R<sub>s</sub>=-0.586, P=0.000), and a weak negative correlation between PANSS N score and identification of unpleasant odors (UPSIT n/9: R<sub>s</sub>=-0.325, P=0.021). Schizophrenic patients present a unique pattern of smell identification characterized by aberrant hedonic ratings for pleasant odors but not unpleasant ones. Individuals with predominant negative symptoms and higher BE concentrations are most able to identify negative odors.",

        "abstract": "Young adulthood represents a critical time to address elevated obesity rates and the risk of early mortality, particularly among people with serious mental illness. Few studies have assessed the benefits of lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss among these young adults. This study examined the impact of the 12-month In SHAPE lifestyle intervention on weight loss and fitness among overweight and obese young adults with serious mental illness (ages 21-30) compared with participants over age 30. Data were combined from three trials of the 12-month In SHAPE program delivered through community mental health centers. In SHAPE includes weekly fitness trainer meetings, a gym membership, and nutrition education. Primary outcomes were weight loss and change in fitness at 12 months. Participants (N=194) had a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (53%) or a mood disorder (47%). The overall sample achieved significant weight loss and improved fitness; differences between young adults (N=29) and participants over age 30 (N=165) were not significant. An important finding was that 42% of young adults achieved clinically significant reductions in cardiovascular risk, defined as \u22655% weight loss or improved fitness (>50-m increase on the 6-Minute Walk Test), compared with 54% of adults over age 30 (a nonsignificant difference between age groups). Among persons enrolled in a lifestyle intervention, overweight and obese young adults experienced benefits comparable with those of adults over age 30. Young adults with serious mental illness face high risk of gaining weight, but a meaningful proportion of these individuals can achieve clinically significant cardiovascular risk reduction, thus highlighting the need to promote lifestyle intervention participation in this group.",

It has various functionally important molecular interaction partners (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1-converting enzyme, neuregulin 1, beta-secretase 1, malate dehydrogenase, P42(IP4)/centaurin-\u03b11, the histone H3 dimethyl Lys4, and others) and is involved in a plethora of normal brain functions. Less is known about possible implications of nardilysin for brain diseases. This review, which includes some of our own recent findings, attempts to summarize the current knowledge on possible roles of nardilysin in Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, mood disorders, alcohol abuse, heroin addiction, and cancer. We herein show that nardilysin is a Janus-faced enzyme with regard to brain pathology, being probably neuropathogenic in some diseases, but neuroprotective in others.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies associate cathepsin K with schizophrenia. The endogenous substrates of this protease, however, remain to be identified. We show here that cathepsin K is capable of liberating met-enkephalin from beta-endorphin (beta-EP) in vitro. To verify if this process might possibly contribute in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia post mortem brains of patients suffering from this disease were analysed immunohistochemically for the presence and co-localization of cathepsin K and beta-EP. In support of a functional role of the observed formation of met-enkephalin on the expense of beta-EP increased numbers of cathepsin K immunoreactive cells, but diminished numbers of both beta-EP-positive cells and double-positive (cathepsin K/beta-EP) cells were found in left and right arcuate nucleus of schizophrenics. In addition a reduced density of beta-EP-immunoreactive neuropil (fibres, nerve terminals) was estimated in the left and right paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of individuals with schizophrenia. Our results imply that cathepsin K, which becomes up-regulated in its cerebral expression by neuroleptic treatment, might significantly contribute to altered opioid levels in brains of schizophrenics, which have previously been reported by us and others, and might reinforce the interest in the putative roles of endorphin and enkephalins in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

A polyclonal antiserum against beta-endorphin was employed for the immunohistochemical detection of the peptide in sections of postmortem human brains. Quantitative analysis revealed that the number of beta-endorphin-containing arcuate neurons was statistically reduced in schizophrenics and depressives in comparison to controls. Moreover, the number of endorphinoceptive (i.e. beta-endorphin-innervated) paraventricular nerve cells was also lower in psychiatric patients than in control cases. Our results showing an altered endorphinergic system in human hypothalami of schizophrenics and depressives might contribute to a renewal of interest in this peptide as a possible factor of importance in psychiatric disorders.",

We continue to observe a high rate of beta-End/beta-LPH nonsuppression in depressed patients following dexamethasone; this escape at the pituitary level is even observed in a number of patients who demonstrate normal cortisol suppression. Advancing age, particularly in women, led to higher baseline cortisol, lower baseline beta-End/beta-LPH, and a greater likelihood of being a nonsuppressor on one or both measures.",

Fundamental to this theory are the clinical observations on interleukin-2 provoking the active phase symptoms of schizophrenia in psychiatrically normal human volunteers and macrophage cytokines producing the prodromal and residual phase symptoms. This theory provides a completely new and unified mechanisms for the antipsychotic action of typical and atypical neuroleptics, bromocriptine, naloxone and DMSO. Furthermore, this hypothesis reveals why the dopamine theory of schizophrenia was a false lead. The effects of prolactin, estrogens and androgens are consistent with the model. Age of onset, male/female incidence, course of the disease from prodromal to active to residual phase, the protection afforded by rheumatoid arthritis and the close relationship between depression and schizophrenia can be explained by this theory. The gastrointestinal tract is suggested as the preferred site to investigate for the cause of the immune activation in schizophrenia.",

Studies of the efficacy of des-tyr-gamma-endorphin were equivocal; more recent studies with des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin have reported some activity but the peptide has only been investigated as an adjunct to neuroleptic medication, apart from one very small active reference comparator study. In the multicentre study reported here, 96 patients suffering from schizophrenia (DSM-III with a current exacerbation if chronic) were allocated randomly to double-blind treatment with either des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin (DE-gamma-E) (Org 5878) 10 mg given as a once daily intramuscular injection for 4 weeks, thioridazine 400 mg orally in 2 divided doses or placebo using a double-dummy technique to preserve blindness. There was a significant advantage for thioridazine compared with placebo registered on all measures at weeks 3 and 4. There was no difference between DE-gamma-E and placebo. There was a significant difference between thioridazine and DE-gamma-E at weeks 3 and 4 registered on the MSS and at week 3 registered on the BPRS. The lack of efficacy of DE-gamma-E suggests that the theories that the endorphins have an important role in schizophrenia have to be revised.

        "abstract": "This article presents a series of experiments that involves the development of three novel strategies for human stress research and the utilization of these strategies to examine neurobehavioral processes of stress in healthy volunteers, schizophrenia, and affective illness. The first strategy involved intravenous 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) administration, a glucoprivic stressor. We found that glucoprivic stress results in dissociation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), adrenomedullary, and sympathoneural activity. In addition, glucoprivic stress in neuroleptic-treated schizophrenic patients caused heightened dopamine activity, as reflected by increased plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels and decreased adaptive responses as assessed by decreased food consumption following 2DG administration. These data suggest that neuroleptics do not prevent stress-related increases in dopamine activity and that schizophrenia may be associated with abnormalities in the stress response. The second strategy assessed effects of uncontrollable and identical amounts of controllable stress in volunteers and depressed patients. In volunteers, it was found that uncontrollable in comparison to controllable stress results in specific behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations. Moreover, uncontrollable stress exposure in depressed patients in comparison to volunteers produced greater alterations in behavioral ratings and plasma cortisol levels and that the uncontrollable stress related increases in helplessness ratings and cortisol levels were significantly correlated. These data suggest that depressed patients may have increased sensitivity to uncontrollable stress and that there may be an important interrelationship between the cognitive deficits of depression and the heightened HPA axis activity observed in these patients. Lastly, we used a naturalistic strategy to examine mechanisms relating childhood parental loss and the development of adult affective illness and found that among subjects with early parental loss histories, those who developed adult psychiatric illness had increased resting plasma levels of cortisol and beta-endorphin (ir) as compared with subjects with early loss and no adult history of psychiatric illness. Moreover, increased HPA activity in adulthood was significantly related to poor childhood adjustment to parental loss. The implications of the results of these studies are discussed.",
