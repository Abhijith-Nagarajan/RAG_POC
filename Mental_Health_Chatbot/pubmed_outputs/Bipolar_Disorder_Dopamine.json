        "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a significant neuropsychiatric condition characterized by marked psychological mood disturbances. Despite extensive research on the symptomatology of BD, the mechanisms underlying its development and presentation remain unknown. Consequently, potential treatments are limited, and existing medications often cause significant side effects, leading to treatment discontinuation. Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in behavioral regulation, reward systems, and mood, highlighting the importance of the dopaminergic system in BD. Elevated levels of DA and tyrosine hydroxylase are associated with the onset of manic episodes, whereas reduced levels are linked to the depressive phase. Additionally, endogenous melatonin (MEL) levels are considerably lower in patients with BD. When administered as a treatment, exogenous MEL and MEL agonists improve behavioral characteristics and significantly modulate DA-related pathophysiological pathways in BD, with minimal adverse effects achieved through MEL receptor activation. Moreover, MEL and MEL agonists offer neuroprotection by promoting physiological homeostasis during disruption. The aim of this review is to investigate and propose MEL receptors as potential novel therapeutic targets for BD. This review seeks to analyze the role of MEL and its agonists in modulating dopamine-related pathophysiological pathways, improving behavioral outcomes, and providing neuroprotection with minimal side effects.",

        "abstract": "Infradian mood and sleep-wake rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond have been observed in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which even persist in the absence of exogenous timing cues, indicating an endogenous origin. Here, we show that mice exposed to methamphetamine in drinking water develop infradian locomotor rhythms with periods of 48 hours and beyond which extend to sleep length and manic state-associated behaviors in support of a model for cycling in BD. The cycling capacity is abrogated upon genetic disruption of dopamine (DA) production in DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or ablation of nucleus accumbens projecting DA neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of <sup>VTA</sup>DA neurons including those that project to the nucleus accumbens led to locomotor period lengthening in circadian clock-deficient mice, which was counteracted by antipsychotic treatment. Together, our findings argue that BD cycling relies on infradian rhythm generation that depends on mesolimbic DA neurons.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in brain physiology. Changes in DA-mediated signaling have been implicated with the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric conditions. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder, characterized by alterning between manic/hypomanic and depressive mood. In experimental research, the pharmacological inhibition of DA reuptake using GBR 12909 serves as a tool to elicit BD-like phenotypes. Alternative model organisms, such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio), have been considered important systems for investigating the neurobehavioral changes involved in different neuropsychiatric conditions, including BD. Here, we discuss the use of GBR 12909 as a novel pharmacological strategy to mimic BD-like phenotypes in zebrafish models. We also emphasize the well-conserved DA-mediated signaling in zebrafish and the early expression of dopaminergic biomarkers in the brain, especially focusing on dopamine transporter (DAT), the main target of GBR 12909. Finally, we discuss potential advantages and limitations in the field, the perspectives of using GBR 12909 in BD research, and how distinct validation criteria (i.e., face, predictive, and construct validity) can be assessed in translational approaches using zebrafish-based models.",

        "title": "Impact of Serotonin Deficiency on Circadian Dopaminergic Rhythms.",
        "abstract": "Physiology and behavior are structured temporally to anticipate daily cycles of light and dark, ensuring fitness and survival. Neuromodulatory systems in the brain-including those involving serotonin and dopamine-exhibit daily oscillations in neural activity and help shape circadian rhythms. Disrupted neuromodulation can cause circadian abnormalities that are thought to underlie several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar mania and schizophrenia, for which a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we show that genetically depleting serotonin in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice promotes manic-like behaviors and disrupts daily oscillations of the dopamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in midbrain dopaminergic nuclei. Specifically, while TH mRNA and protein levels in the Substantia Nigra (SN) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of wild-type mice doubled between the light and dark phase, TH levels were high throughout the day in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice, suggesting a hyperdopaminergic state. Analysis of TH expression in striatal terminal fields also showed blunted rhythms. Additionally, we found low abundance and blunted rhythmicity of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (Cck) in the VTA of knockout mice, a neuropeptide whose downregulation has been implicated in manic-like states in both rodents and humans. Altogether, our results point to a previously unappreciated serotonergic control of circadian dopamine signaling and propose serotonergic dysfunction as an upstream mechanism underlying dopaminergic deregulation and ultimately maladaptive behaviors.",

However, we still understand very little about the mechanisms of DBS and its application on BD. The present study aimed to investigate the behavioural and neurochemical effects of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DBS in an animal model of mania induced by methamphetamine (m-amph). Wistar rats were given 14\u2009days of m-amph injections, and on the last day, animals were submitted to 20\u2009min of VTA DBS in two different patterns: intermittent low-frequency stimulation (LFS) or continuous high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Immediately after DBS, manic-like behaviour and nucleus accumbens (NAc) phasic dopamine (DA) release were evaluated in different groups of animals through open-field tests and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Levels of NAc dopaminergic markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. M-amph induced hyperlocomotion in the animals and both DBS parameters reversed this alteration. M-amph increased DA reuptake time post-sham compared to baseline levels, and both LFS and HFS were able to block this alteration. LFS was also able to reduce phasic DA release when compared to baseline. LFS was able to increase dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in the NAc. These results demonstrate that both VTA LFS and HFS DBS exert anti-manic effects and modulation of DA dynamics in the NAc. More specifically the increase in DA reuptake driven by increased DAT expression may serve as a potential mechanism by which VTA DBS exerts its anti-manic effects.",

        "abstract": "A primary goal of psychiatry is to better understand the pathways that link genetic risk to psychiatric symptoms. Here, we tested association of diagnosis and endophenotypes with overall and neurotransmitter pathway-specific polygenic risk in patients with early-stage psychosis. Subjects included 205 demographically diverse cases with a psychotic disorder who underwent comprehensive psychiatric and neurological phenotyping and 115 matched controls. Following genotyping, we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS summary statistics. To test if overall genetic risk can be partitioned into affected neurotransmitter pathways, we calculated pathway PGSs (pPGSs) for SZ risk affecting each of four major neurotransmitter systems: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Psychosis subjects had elevated SZ PGS versus controls; cases with SZ or BP diagnoses had stronger SZ or BP risk, respectively. There was no significant association within psychosis cases between individual symptom measures and overall PGS. However, neurotransmitter-specific pPGSs were moderately associated with specific endophenotypes; notably, glutamate was associated with SZ diagnosis and with deficits in cognitive control during task-based fMRI, while dopamine was associated with global functioning. Finally, unbiased endophenotype-driven clustering identified three diagnostically mixed case groups that separated on primary deficits of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognitive control. All clusters showed strong genome-wide risk. Cluster 2, characterized by deficits in cognitive control and negative symptoms, additionally showed specific risk concentrated in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Due to the intensive characterization of our subjects, the present study was limited to a relatively small cohort. As such, results should be followed up with additional research at the population and mechanism level. Our study suggests pathway-based PGS analysis may be a powerful path forward to study genetic mechanisms driving psychiatric endophenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease are two distinct neurological conditions that share common features related to dopaminergic dysfunction. This article presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature to investigate the association between bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease, focusing on the dopaminergic hypothesis and potential therapeutic options. The dopaminergic hypothesis suggests that both bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease involve impairments in the nigrostriatal or mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways. Studies have demonstrated alterations in dopamine regulation during manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder. Similarly, Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in motor symptoms. Recent analyses have highlighted a predisposition to Parkinson's disease in individuals with bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease in patients with bipolar disorder. However, differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from parkinsonism induced by medications used in bipolar disorder can be challenging. Dopamine transporter (DAT) scans can aid in making a differential diagnosis. Treatment options for patients with both bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease are limited. Neuroleptics, commonly used to manage psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease, may worsen motor symptoms and have limitations in bipolar disorder patients. Clozapine has shown efficacy in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms. Pimavanserin, an inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor can offer new opportunities. However, its efficacy in bipolar disorder patients with Parkinson's disease remains unexplored. In conclusion, the association between bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease is supported by the involvement of the dopaminergic system in both conditions. The identification of shared mechanisms opens new avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy of pimavanserin and explore other treatment options for individuals with both bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease.",

We aimed to investigate the relationship between visuomotor coordination and social cognition in the euthymic stage of BD (euBD). Given the shared neurobiological underpinnings involving the dopaminergic system and corticostriatal circuitry, we hypothesized a positive correlation between social cognition and visuomotor coordination in euBD patients. 40 euBD patients and 59 healthy control (HC) participants underwent evaluation of social (Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Taiwan version (DANVA-2-TW)), non-social cognitive function and visuomotor coordination. A subgroup of participants completed single-photon emission computed tomography for striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability assessment. EuBD patients showed impaired nonverbal emotion recognition (ps\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.033) and poorer visuomotor coordination (ps\u00a0<\u00a00.003) compared to HC, with a positive correlation between these two abilities (r\u00a0=\u00a00.55, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

        "abstract": "Lumateperone is a novel antipsychotic medication that has recently received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of major depressive episodes of type I and II bipolar disorder. It is approved for use as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproic acid. Clinical trials performed with lumateperone for bipolar disorder were reviewed. Additionally, pharmacodynamic actions of lumateperone are reviewed. Lumateperone is superior to placebo whether used alone or in combination with a mood stabilizer in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder. It achieves this effect with minimal dopamine blockade-related side effects due to less than 50% dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. While the pharmacodynamic profile of lumateperone is unique, the mechanism of action in bipolar depression remains obscure. Lumateperone is an antipsychotic with full antagonist effects at the post-synaptic D2, and partial agonist effects at the presynaptic D2. This unique profile allows for both antipsychotic and antidepressant effects at the same dose, which does not produce dopamine-related side effects. Consequently, lumateperone is exceptionally well tolerated compared to other antidepressant-acting antipsychotic agents. It is now the only agent approved as an adjunct to the mood stabilizer for bipolar II depression.",

        "abstract": "Lithium is one of the most effect mood-stabilizing drugs prescribed especially for bipolar disorder. Lithium has wide range effects on different molecular factors and neural transmission including dopaminergic signaling. On the other hand, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic signaling is significantly involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review article aims to study lithium therapeutic mechanisms, dopaminergic signaling, and the interaction of lithium and dopamine. We concluded that acute and chronic lithium treatments often reduce dopamine synthesis and level in the brain. However, some studies have reported conflicting results following lithium treatment, especially chronic treatment. The dosage, duration, and type of lithium administration, and the brain region selected for measuring dopamine level were not significant differences in different chronic treatments used in previous studies. It was suggested that lithium has various mechanisms affecting dopaminergic signaling and mood, and that many molecular factors can be involved, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), \u03b2-catenin, protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2). Thus, molecular effects of lithium can be the most important mechanisms of lithium that also alter neural transmissions including dopaminergic signaling in mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways.",

Lithium has antimanic and neuroprotective properties, but only 30% BD patients respond to lithium pharmacotherapy. Dopamine signaling has been implicated in BD and may contribute to lithium response. Methamphetamine (METH) stimulates dopamine release and models the clinical features of mania but has never been used to study cell death in BD patient neurons. We used BD patient derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) to determine whether the vulnerability to cell death differed in samples from lithium responder (Li-R) and non-responder (Li-NR) BD patients and healthy controls following METH exposure in vitro. We hypothesized that NPCs from Li-R and Li-NR would differ in vulnerability to METH, dopamine signaling and neuroprotection from lithium. Following METH, NPCs from controls and Li-NR showed significantly greater cell loss compared to Li-R. Pre-treatment of NPCs with the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 reversed the neurotoxic effects of METH. In Li-R NPCs, expression of phosho-ERK1/2 was significantly increased. In Li-NR NPCs, phospho-AKT, D1 and D2 dopamine receptor proteins were significantly increased. Pre-treatment of NPCs with lithium before METH reversed the neurotoxic effects of METH in control NPCs, whereas Li-NR showed less protective benefit. Li-R cells showed decreased levels of cell death after METH and comparatively high viability, and lithium treatment did not increase viability any further. This novel NPC model of mania reveals differences in cell death that could help identify mechanisms of lithium response in BD.",

Despite the progress in neurobiological research, the pathophysiology of BD has not been extensively described to date. Progress in the understanding of the neurobiology driving BD could help facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and biomarkers for its early detection. Oxidative stress (OS), which damages biomolecules and causes mitochondrial and dopamine system dysfunctions, is a persistent finding in patients with BD. Inflammation and immune dysfunction might also play a role in BD pathophysiology. Specific nutrient supplements (nutraceuticals) may target neurobiological pathways suggested to be perturbed in BD, such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and OS. Consequently, nutraceuticals may be used in the adjunctive treatment of BD. This paper summarizes the possible roles of OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune system dysregulation in the onset of BD. It then discusses OS-mitigating strategies that may serve as therapeutic interventions for BD. It also analyzes the relationship between diet and BD as well as the use of nutritional interventions in the treatment of BD. In addition, it addresses the use of lithium therapy; novel antipsychotic agents, including clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, cariprazine, and quetiapine; and anti-inflammatory agents to treat BD. Furthermore, it reviews the efficacy of the most used therapies for BD, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, imagery-focused cognitive therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. A better understanding of the roles of OS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, along with a stronger elucidation of the therapeutic functions of antioxidants, antipsychotics, anti-inflammatory agents, lithium therapy, and light therapies, may lead to improved strategies for the treatment and prevention of bipolar disorder.",

To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set.

Abnormal striatal activation has repeatedly been observed in patients with bipolar disorder (BD); however, such abnormality remains unclear in BD II. Here we aimed to investigate whether the corticostriatal connectivity was altered and the possible relationships among corticostriatal connectivity, OXT, and dopamine systems in BD II. Twenty-five BD II patients, as defined by the DSM-V, and 29 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in this study. Plasma OXT was measured and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was assessed using [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]TRODAT-1 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Brain network functional connectivity (FC) was measured during the resting-state using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the dorsal caudate (DC) was selected as the seed region. The results showed that the OXT level was significantly lower in the BD II patients, while the striatal DAT availability was not significantly different between the BD II and HC groups. The BD II patients exhibited significantly lower FC between the DC and the executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior parietal cortex) as compared with the HC. Only observed in HC, the DC-posterior parietal cortex FC was negatively correlated with the OXT level and striatal DAT availability. Our findings in the HC support a model in which the OXT and dopamine systems act in tandem to regulate corticostriatal circuitry, while the synergistic interaction was perturbed in BD II. Taken together, these results implied a maladaptive neuroplasticity in BD II.",

        "title": "Heightened reward response is associated with HCN2 overexpression in the ventral tegmental area in morphine-sensitized rats.",
        "abstract": "Morphine sensitization is associated with increased locomotion and stereotypies in rats. This persistent condition has been proposed as a model of manic-like symptoms. Modifications in reward threshold are considered a central feature of mania and have been related to changes in mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic transmission. Thus, to further characterize this model, we investigated reward responses in morphine-sensitized male rats and the mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenotype. In particular, we examined the possible involvement of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels as they play a critical role in regulating the excitability of dopaminergic neurons. Rats were trained to self-administer sucrose to study whether morphine sensitization affected motivated behavior. Next, the dopaminergic response to sucrose was examined in the nucleus accumbens shell by in vivo microdialysis. To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the increased dopaminergic transmission in morphine-sensitized rats, HCN2 channel expression levels in mesocorticolimbic regions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Sensitized rats showed an enhanced motivation to work for sucrose that was accompanied by an increased dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption in the nucleus accumbens shell. Moreover, HCN2 expression levels were increased in the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that their increased expression may underpin the enhanced motivation for sucrose reward and nucleus accumbens shell dopaminergic response in sensitized rats. The modified behavioral and dopaminergic reward response observed in sensitized rats supports the suggestion that the condition of morphine sensitization can be regarded as a model of manic symptoms.",

        "title": "Genetics of schizophrenia in the South African Xhosa.",
        "abstract": "Africa, the ancestral home of all modern humans, is the most informative continent for understanding the human genome and its contribution to complex disease. To better understand the genetics of schizophrenia, we studied the illness in the Xhosa population of South Africa, recruiting 909 cases and 917 age-, gender-, and residence-matched controls. Individuals with schizophrenia were significantly more likely than controls to harbor private, severely damaging mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic function, including neural circuitry mediated by the neurotransmitters glutamine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, and dopamine. Schizophrenia is genetically highly heterogeneous, involving severe ultrarare mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic plasticity. The depth of genetic variation in Africa revealed this relationship with a moderate sample size and informed our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia worldwide.",

        "title": "Dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor and GSK3\u03b2 signaling mediate deficits in novel object recognition memory within dopamine transporter knockdown mice.",
        "abstract": "Over-stimulation of dopamine signaling is thought to underlie the pathophysiology of a list of mental disorders, such as psychosis, mania and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These disorders are frequently associated with cognitive deficits in attention or learning and memory, suggesting that persistent activation of dopamine signaling may change neural plasticity to induce cognitive or emotional malfunction. Dopamine transporter knockdown (DAT-KD) mice were used to mimic a hyper-dopamine state. Novel object recognition (NOR) task was performed to assess the recognition memory. To test the role of dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor (D<sub>3</sub>R) on NOR, DAT-KD mice were treated with either a D<sub>3</sub>R antagonist, FAUC365 or by deletion of D<sub>3</sub>R. Total or phospho-GSK3 and -ERK1/2 signals in various brain regions were measured by Western blot analyses. To examine the impact of GSK3 signal on NOR, wild-type mice were systemically treated with GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 or, micro-injected with lentiviral shRNA of GSK3\u03b2 or GSK3\u03b1 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We confirmed our previous findings that DAT-KD mice displayed a deficit in NOR memory, which could be prevented by deletion of D<sub>3</sub>R or exposure to FAUC365. In WT mice, p-GSK3\u03b1 and p-GSK3\u03b2 were significantly decreased in the mPFC after exposure to novel objects; however, the DAT-KD mice exhibited no such change in mPFC p-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 levels. DAT-KD mice treated with FAUC365 or with D<sub>3</sub>R deletion exhibited restored novelty-induced GSK3 dephosphorylation in the mPFC. Moreover, inhibition of GSK3 in WT mice diminished NOR performance and impaired recognition memory. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, in the mPFC of WT mice also impaired NOR. These findings suggest that D<sub>3</sub>R acts via GSK3\u03b2 signaling in the mPFC to play a functional role in NOR memory. In addition, treatment with D<sub>3</sub>R antagonists may be a reasonable approach for ameliorating cognitive impairments or episodic memory deficits in bipolar disorder patients.",
