        "abstract": "The 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level determination is crucial for predicting, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. To realize the extraction of trace 5-HT in complex matrix samples, a magnetic molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MMISPE) pretreatment method was developed. In combination with UPLC-MS/MS, the method was possible to achieve the quantification of 1\u00a0ng/mL 5-HT in tissue samples. The type of adsorbent, magnetic surface molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) adsorbent dosage, adsorption temperature, and adsorption method were screened to obtain the better extraction of 5-HT. After optimizing the extraction and separation method, we applied the MMISPE method to the detection of 5-HT in peripheral blood of clinical schizophrenia patients. The results showed that the average concentration of 5-HT in the peripheral blood of healthy controls was 74.30\u00a0ng/mL, whereas the 5-HT content in the samples from schizophrenic patients was 1.17\u00a0ng/mL.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of schizophrenia in young adulthood may be associated with intrauterine factors, such as gestational alcohol consumption. This study investigated the relationship between a single high dose of alcohol during pregnancy in Wistar rats and the development of schizophrenia in the adult life of the offspring. On the 11th day of gestation, pregnant rats received either water or alcohol via intragastric gavage. Male and female offspring were subjected to behavioral tests at 30\u00a0days of age according to the maternal group. At 60\u00a0days of age, offspring received intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (ket) or saline (SAL). After the final ketamine administration, the adult offspring underwent behavioral tests, and their brain structures were removed for biochemical analysis. Alcohol binge drinking during pregnancy induces hyperlocomotion in both young female and male offspring, with males of alcohol-exposed mothers showing reduced social interactions. In adult offspring, ketamine induced hyperlocomotion; however, only females in the alcohol\u00a0+\u00a0ket group exhibited increased locomotor activity, and a decrease in the time to first contact was observed in the alcohol group. Cognitive impairment was exclusively observed in male animals in the alcohol group. Increased serotonin and dopamine levels were observed in male rats in the alcohol\u00a0+\u00a0ket group. Biochemical alterations indicate the effects of intrauterine alcohol exposure associated with ketamine in adult animals. These behavioral and biochemical changes suggest that the impact of prenatal stressors such as alcohol persists throughout the animals' lives and may be exacerbated by a second stressor in adulthood, such as ketamine.",

        "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are sophisticated signaling machines able to simultaneously elicit multiple intracellular signaling pathways upon activation. Complete (in)activation of all pathways can be counterproductive for specific therapeutic applications. This is the case for the serotonin 2\u2009A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R), a prominent target for the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, we elucidate the complex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R coupling signature in response to different signaling probes, and its physiological consequences by combining computational modeling, in vitro and in vivo experiments with human postmortem brain studies. We show how chemical modification of the endogenous agonist serotonin dramatically impacts the G protein coupling profile of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R and the associated behavioral responses. Importantly, among these responses, we demonstrate that memory deficits are regulated by G<sub>\u03b1q</sub> protein activation, whereas psychosis-related behavior is modulated through G<sub>\u03b1i1</sub> stimulation. These findings emphasize the complexity of GPCR pharmacology and physiology and open the path to designing improved therapeutics for the treatment of stchizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The intricate involvement of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) both in schizophrenia and in the activity of antipsychotic drugs is widely acknowledged. The currently marketed antipsychotic drugs, although effective in managing the symptoms of schizophrenia to a certain extent, are not without their repertoire of serious side effects. There is a need for better therapeutics to treat schizophrenia for which understanding the mechanism of action of the current antipsychotic drugs is imperative. With bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, we trace the signaling signature of six antipsychotic drugs belonging to three generations at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R for the entire spectrum of signaling pathways activated by serotonin (5-HT). The antipsychotic drugs display previously unidentified pathway preference at the level of the individual G\u03b1 subunits and \u03b2-arrestins. In particular, risperidone, clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol showed G protein-selective inverse agonist activity. In addition, G protein-selective partial agonism was found for aripiprazole and cariprazine. Pathway-specific apparent dissociation constants determined from functional analyses revealed distinct coupling-modulating capacities of the tested antipsychotics at the different 5-HT-activated pathways. Computational analyses of the pharmacological and structural fingerprints support a mechanistically based clustering that recapitulate the clinical classification (typical/first generation, atypical/second generation, third generation) of the antipsychotic drugs. The study provides a new framework to functionally classify antipsychotics that should represent a useful tool for the identification of better and safer neuropsychiatric drugs and allows formulating hypotheses on the links between specific signaling cascades and in the clinical outcomes of the existing drugs.",

However, current pharmacological treatment regimens are subpar in terms of effectiveness. This study aimed to investigate the function of Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract in SCZ in mouse models. The SCZ mouse model was established by MK-801 injection and feeding of Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract or combined antibiotics. Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract significantly improved the aberrant behaviors and neuronal damage in SCZ mice, upregulated SYP and PSD-95 expression and BDNF levels in hippocampal homogenates, down-regulated DA and 5-HT levels, and suppressed microglial activation in SCZ mice. Moreover, Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract improved the integrity of the intestinal tract barrier. The 16\u202fS rRNA sequencing of feces showed that Radix Bupleuri extract modulated the composition of gut flora. Lactobacillus abundance was decreased in SCZ mice and reversed by Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract administration which exhibited a significant negative correlation with IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, DA, and 5-HT, and a significant positive correlation with BDNF levels in hippocampal tissues. The abundance of Parabacteroides and Alloprevotella was increased in SCZ mice. It was reversed by Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract administration, which exhibited a positive correlation with IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and 5-HT and a negative correlation with BDNF. In conclusion, Radix Bupleuri aqueous extract attenuates the inflammatory response in hippocampal tissues and modulates neurotransmitter levels, exerting its neuroprotective effect in SCZ. Meanwhile, the alteration of intestinal flora may be involved in this process, which is expected to be an underlying therapeutic option in treating SCZ.",

        "abstract": "Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation and induce several behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are\u00a0considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists in schizophrenia therapy.",

Lurasidone has antagonistic effects on the dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors and a partial agonistic effect on the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor with low affinities for muscarinic M<sub>1</sub>, histamine H<sub>1</sub>, and a<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors. The receptor-binding profile of lurasidone is thought to be associated with fewer side effects such as anticholinergic effects, lipid abnormalities, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. Behavioral pharmacological studies have demonstrated that lurasidone exerts anxiolytic and antidepressive effects and improves cognitive function, which are associated with the modulation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Literature search using PubMed was performed to find published studies of randomized controlled trials and recent meta-analyses regarding efficacy and safety, particularly metabolic side effects of lurasidone in schizophrenia. In short-term studies, the results of randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses have suggested that lurasidone was superior to placebo in improving total psychopathology, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology in patients with acute schizophrenia. Regarding safety, lurasidone had minimal metabolic side effects, and was identified as one of the drugs with the most benign profiles for metabolic side effects. Long-term trials revealed that lurasidone had the preventive effects on relapse, with minimal effects on weight gain and other metabolic side effects. Furthermore, lurasidone improves cognitive and functional performance of patients with schizophrenia, especially in long-term treatment. Patients with schizophrenia require long-term treatment with antipsychotics for relapse prevention; thus, minimizing weight gain and other side effects is crucial. Lurasidone is suitable as one of the first-line antipsychotic drugs in the acute phase, and a switching strategy should be considered during the maintenance phase, to balance efficacy and adverse effects and achieve favorable outcomes in the long-term course of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Abnormalities in dopamine function might be related to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Even at the same concentration, dopamine exerts opposite effects on information processing in the prefrontal cortex depending on independent dopamine release modes known as tonic and phasic releases. This duality of dopamine prevents a blanket interpretation of the implications of dopamine abnormalities for diseases on the basis of absolute dopamine levels. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the mode-specific dopamine abnormalities are not clearly understood. Here, I show that the two modes of dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex of a schizophrenia-like model are disrupted by different mechanisms. In the schizophrenia-like model established by perinatal exposure to inflammatory cytokine, epidermal growth factor, tonic release was enhanced and phasic release was decreased in the prefrontal cortex. I examined the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which sends dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex, under anaesthesia. The activation of VTA dopamine neurons during excitatory stimulation (local application of glutamate or N-methyl-d-aspartic acid [NMDA]), which is associated with phasic activity, was blunt in this model. Dopaminergic neuronal activity in the resting state related to tonic release was increased by disinhibition of the dopamine neurons due to the impairment of 5HT2 (5HT2A) receptor-regulated GABAergic inputs. Moreover, chronic administration of risperidone ameliorated this disinhibition of dopaminergic neurons. These results provide an idea about the mechanism of dopamine disturbance in schizophrenia and may be informative in explaining the effects of atypical antipsychotics as distinct from those of typical drugs.",

        "abstract": "The serotonin (5-HT)<sub>2\u00a0C</sub> receptor(R) is a widely distributed G-protein-coupled receptor, expressed abundantly in the central nervous system. Alstonine is a natural product that has significant properties of atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs), in part attributed to 5-HT<sub>2\u00a0C</sub>R agonism. Based on alstonine, we developed NU-1223, a simplified \u03b2 carboline analog of alstonine, which shows efficacies comparable to alstonine and to other 5-HT<sub>2\u00a0C</sub>R agonists, Ro-60-0175 and lorcaserin. The 5-HT<sub>2\u00a0C</sub>R antagonism of some APDs, including olanzapine, contributes to weight gain, a major side effect which limits its tolerability, while the 5-HT<sub>2\u00a0C</sub>R agonists and/or modulators, may minimize weight gain. We used the well-established rodent subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) model to test the efficacy of NU-1223 on episodic memory, using novel object recognition (NOR) task, positive (locomotor activity), and negative symptoms (social interaction) of schizophrenia (SCH). We found that NU-1223 produced both transient and prolonged rescue of the subchronic PCP-induced deficits in NOR and SI. Further, NU-1223, but not Ro-60-0175, blocked PCP and amphetamine (AMPH)-induced increase in LMA in subchronic PCP mice. These transient efficacies in LMA were blocked by the 5-HT<sub>2\u00a0C</sub>R antagonist, SB242084. Sub-chronic NU-1223 treatment rescued NOR and SI deficits in subchronic PCP mice for at least 39 days after 3 days injection. Chronic treatment with NU-1223, ip, twice a day for 21 days, did not increase average body weight vs olanzapine. These findings clearly indicate NU-1223 as a class of small molecules with a possible 5-HT<sub>2\u00a0C</sub>R-agonist-like mechanism of action, attributing to its efficacy. Additional in-depth receptor mechanistic studies are warranted, as this small molecule, both transiently and chronically rescued PCP-induced deficits. Furthermore, NU-1223 did not induce weight gain post long-term administrations vs AAPDs such as olanzapine, making NU-1223 a putative therapeutic compound for SCH.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 98 patients with schizophrenia. Brain dynamics included the temporal and spatial variations in functional connectivity density and association with symptom scores were evaluated. Moreover, the spatial association between dynamics and receptors/transporters according to prior molecular imaging in healthy subjects was examined. Patients demonstrated decreased temporal variation and increased spatial variation in perceptual and attentional systems. However, increased temporal variation and decreased spatial variation were revealed in higher order networks and subcortical networks in patients. Specifically, spatial variation in perceptual and attentional systems was associated with symptom severity. Moreover, case-control differences were associated with dopamine, serotonin and mu-opioid receptor densities, serotonin reuptake transporter density, dopamine transporter density, and dopamine synthesis capacity. Therefore, this study implicates the abnormal dynamic interactions between the perceptual system and cortical core networks; in addition, the subcortical regions play a role in the dynamic interaction among the cortical regions in schizophrenia. These convergent findings support the importance of brain dynamics and emphasize the contribution of primary information processing to the pathological mechanism underlying schizophrenia.",

First generation or typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol and second generation or atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and risperidone remain the current standard for schizophrenia treatment. In some patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotics produce complete remission of positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. However, antipsychotic drugs are ineffective against cognitive deficits and indeed treated schizophrenia patients have small improvements or even deterioration in several cognitive domains. This underlines the need for novel and more efficient therapeutic targets for schizophrenia treatment.

Serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) and metabotropic glutamate 2 receptor (mGluR2) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that interact at epigenetic and functional levels.

Like most psychotic diseases, it is also considered a complicated mental disorder caused by an imbalance in neurotransmitters. Due to the complexity of neuropathology, it is always a complicated disorder. The lack of proper understanding of the pathophysiology makes the disorder unmanageable in clinical settings. However, due to recent advances in animal models, we hope we can have better therapeutic approaches with more success in clinical settings. Dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and serotonin are the neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Various animal models have been put forward based on these neurotransmitters, including pharmacological, neurodevelopmental, and genetic models. Polymorphism of genes such as dysbindin, DICS1, and NRG1 has also been reported in schizophrenia.

Neurochemical disorganizations, neurotrophic and neuroimmune alterations are some of the challenging neuropathologies proving unabated during psychopharmacology of schizophrenia, further bedeviled by drug-induced metabolic derangements including alteration of amino acids. In first-episode schizophrenia patients, taurine, an essential \u03b2-amino acid represses psychotic-symptoms. However, its anti-psychotic-like mechanisms remain incomplete. This study evaluated the ability of taurine to prevent or reverse ketamine-induced experimental psychosis and the underlying neurochemical, neurotrophic and neuroinmune mechanisms involved in taurine's clinical action. The study consisted of three different experiments with Swiss mice (n\u2009=\u20097). In the drug alone, mice received saline (10\u00a0mL/kg/p.o./day), taurine (50 and 100\u00a0mg/kg/p.o./day) and risperidone (0.5\u00a0mg/kg/p.o./day) for 14\u00a0days.

In the reversal study, mice received ketamine for 14\u00a0days before taurine or risperidone treatments from days 8 to 14 respectively. Afterwards, stereotypy behaviour, social, non-spatial memory deficits, and body weights were assessed. Neurochemical (dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, glutamic acid decarboxylase, (GAD)), brain derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6, (IL-6)] were assayed in the striatum,\u00a0prefrontal-cortex and\u00a0hippocampal area. Taurine attenuates ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like behaviour without changes in body weight. Taurine reduced ketamine-induced dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine changes, and increased GAD and BDNF levels in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus, suggesting increased GABAergic and neurotrophic transmissions. Taurine decreases ketamine-induced increased in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 concentrations in the striatum, prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus. These findings also suggest that taurine protects against schizophrenia through neurochemical modulations, neurotrophic enhancement, and inhibition of neuropathologic cytokine activities.",

        "abstract": "The serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and increasing evidence shows that they interact functionally. Of note, the G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) and the G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled metabotropic glutamate type 2 (mGlu2) receptors have been demonstrated to assemble into a functional heteromeric complex that modulates the function of each individual receptor. For conformation of the heteromeric complex, corresponding transmembrane-4 segment of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and mGlu2 are required. The 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>/mGlu2 heteromeric complex is necessary for the activation of G<sub>q/11</sub> proteins and for the subsequent increase in the levels of the intracellular messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, signaling via the heteromeric complex is dysregulated in the post-mortem brains of patients with schizophrenia, and could be linked to altered cortical function. From a behavioral perspective, this complex contributes to the hallucinatory and antipsychotic behaviors associated with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and mGlu2/3 agonists, respectively. Synaptic and epigenetic mechanisms have also been found to be significantly associated with the mGlu2/5-HT<sub>2A</sub> heteromeric complex. This review summarizes the role of crosstalk between mGlu2 and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> in the mechanism of antipsychotic effects and introduces recent key advancements on this topic.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal environmental insults increase the risk of neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions in the offspring. Structural modifications of dendritic spines are central to brain development and plasticity. Using maternal immune activation (MIA) as a rodent model of prenatal environmental insult, previous results have reported dendritic structural deficits in the frontal cortex. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying MIA-induced synaptic structural alterations in the offspring. Using prenatal (E12.5) injection with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid potassium salt as a mouse MIA model, we show here that upregulation of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) is at least in part responsible for some of the effects of prenatal insults on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and sensorimotor gating processes. Mechanistically, we report that this upregulation of frontal cortex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression is associated with MIA-induced reduction of nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, consequently, a decrease in the enrichment of GR at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R promoter. The translational significance of these preclinical findings is supported by data in postmortem human brain samples suggesting dysregulation of GR translocation in frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. We also found that repeated corticosterone administration augmented frontal cortex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression and reduced GR binding to the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R promoter. However, virally (adeno-associated virus) mediated augmentation of GR function reduced frontal cortex 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression and improved sensorimotor gating processes via 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R. Together, these data support a negative regulatory relationship between GR signaling and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expression in the mouse frontal cortex that may carry implications for the pathophysiology underlying 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R dysregulation in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.",

        "title": "Association between the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials and age in patients with schizophrenia and depression.",
        "abstract": "Although serotonergic dysfunction is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), comparison of serotonergic dysfunction in both diseases has received little attention. Serotonin hypotheses have suggested diminished and elevated serotonin activity in MDD and SCZ, respectively. However, the foundations underlying these hypotheses are unclear regarding changes in serotonin neurotransmission in the aging brain. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) reflects serotonin neurotransmission. The present study compared the LDAEP between patients with SCZ or MDD and healthy controls (HCs). We further examined whether age was correlated with the LDAEP and clinical symptoms. This prospective clinical study included 105 patients with SCZ (n\u2009=\u200954) or MDD (n\u2009=\u200951). Additionally, 35 HCs were recruited for this study. The LDAEP was measured on the midline channels via 62 electroencephalography channels. Patients with SCZ or MDD showed a significantly smaller mean LDAEP than those in HCs. The LDAEP was positively correlated with age in patients with SCZ or MDD. Changes in central serotonergic activity could be indicated by evaluating the LDAEP in patients with SCZ or MDD. Age-related reductions in serotonergic activity may be screened using the LDAEP in patients with SCZ or MDD.",

        "abstract": "Psychotic disorders are currently diagnosed by examining the patient's mental state and medical history. Identifying reliable diagnostic, monitoring, predictive, or prognostic biomarkers would be useful in clinical settings and help to understand the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here, we performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectroscopy on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples of 25 patients at their first-episode psychosis (FEP) manifestation (baseline) and after 18 months (follow-up). CSF and serum samples of 21 healthy control (HC) subjects were also analyzed. By comparing FEP and HC groups at baseline, we found eight CSF and 32 serum psychosis-associated metabolites with non-redundant identifications. Most remarkable was the finding of increased CSF serotonin (5-HT) levels. Most metabolites identified at baseline did not differ between groups at 18-month follow-up with significant improvement of positive symptoms and cognitive functions. Comparing FEP patients at baseline and 18-month follow-up, we identified 20 CSF metabolites and 90 serum metabolites that changed at follow-up. We further utilized Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified candidate signaling pathways involved in psychosis pathogenesis and progression. In an extended cohort, we validated that CSF 5-HT levels were higher in FEP patients than in HC at baseline by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. To conclude, these findings provide insights into the pathophysiology of psychosis and identify potential psychosis-associated biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin type-3 receptor (5-HT<sub>3</sub>R) antagonists show potential as a treatment for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. CVN058, a brain-penetrant, potent and selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R antagonist, shows efficacy in rodent models of cognition and was well-tolerated in Phase-1 studies. We evaluated the target engagement of CVN058 using mismatch negativity (MMN) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Subjects were stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with antipsychotics. Subjects were not permitted to use other 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R modulators or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Each subject received a high (150\u2009mg) and low (15\u2009mg or 75\u2009mg) oral dose of CVN058 and placebo in a randomized order across 3 single-day treatment visits separated by at least 1 week. The primary pre-registered outcome was amplitude of duration MMN. Amplitude of other MMN deviants (frequency, intensity, frequency modulation, and location), P50, P300 and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were exploratory endpoints. 19 of 22 randomized subjects (86.4%) completed the study. Baseline PANSS scores indicated moderate impairment. CVN058 150\u2009mg led to significant improvement vs. placebo on the primary outcome of duration MMN (p\u2009=\u20090.02, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.48). A significant treatment effect was also seen in a combined analysis across all MMN deviants (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20090.57). Effects on location MMN were independently significant (p\u2009<\u20090.007, d\u2009=\u20090.46). No other significant effects were seen for other deviants, doses or EEG measures. There were no clinically significant treatment related adverse effects. These results show MMN to be a sensitive target engagement biomarker for 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, and support the potential utility of CVN058 in correcting the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia.",

        "title": "Opposite alterations of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor brain density in subjects with schizophrenia: relevance of radiotracers pharmacological profile.",
        "abstract": "The status of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs) in schizophrenia has been controversial. In vivo positron emission tomography neuroimaging and in vitro post-mortem binding studies have reported conflicting results about 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density. Radiotracers bind different receptor conformations depending on their agonist, antagonist or inverse agonist properties. This study investigates 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex from subjects with schizophrenia and controls using three radiotracers with a different pharmacological profile. The specific binding parameters of the inverse agonist [<sup>18</sup>F]altanserin, the agonist [<sup>3</sup>H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the antagonist [<sup>3</sup>H]MDL100907 to brain cortex membranes from 20 subjects with schizophrenia and 20 individually matched controls were evaluated under similar methodological conditions. Ten schizophrenia subjects were antipsychotic-free at death. Saturation curve analyses were performed by non-linear regression to obtain a maximal density of binding sites (B<sub>max</sub>) and the affinity of the respective radiotracers (K<sub>d</sub>). In schizophrenia subjects, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R density was decreased when quantified by [<sup>18</sup>F]altanserin binding, whereas increased when evaluated by [<sup>3</sup>H]LSD binding. However, [<sup>3</sup>H]MDL100907 binding was unaltered. A slight loss of affinity (higher K<sub>d</sub>) was observed exclusively in [<sup>3</sup>H]LSD binding. The findings were more evident in antipsychotic-free subjects than in antipsychotic-treated subjects. In conclusion, a higher proportion of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-active functional conformation, which is rather identified by agonist radiotracers, was observed in schizophrenia patients. A consequent reduction of the inactive 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R conformation, which is preferentially identified by inverse agonist radiotracers, was also obtained. Antagonist radiotracers do not distinguish between molecular conformations of the receptor, and accordingly, the absence of changes was shown. These results are compatible with the proposed increased functional activity of brain cortical 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in schizophrenia.",
