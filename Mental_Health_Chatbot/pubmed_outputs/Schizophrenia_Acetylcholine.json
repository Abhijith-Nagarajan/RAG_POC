However, strategies to address tolerability concerns associated with activation of peripheral mAChRs were not available at that time. The discovery of specific targeted ligands and combination treatments to reduce peripheral mAChR engagement have advanced the potential of mAChR activators as effective treatments for psychotic disorders. This review provides perspectives on the background of the identification of mAChRs as potential antipsychotics, advances in the preclinical understanding of mAChRs as targets, and the current state of mAChR activators under active clinical development for schizophrenia.",

In 1937, Fiamberti (1894-1970) introduced the transorbital method of lobotomy which established the use of acetylcholine shock treatment for curing the disturbances of schizophrenia. Accepting the idea that the psychic alterations of schizophrenia were caused by a pathological interruption of nerve conduction at a presumably cortical level, Fiamberti thought he could apply this to the clinical field using the properties of acetylcholine, an acetic ester of choline.

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with core deficits in cognitive abilities and impaired functioning of the newly evolved prefrontal association cortex (PFC). In particular, neuropathological studies of schizophrenia have found selective atrophy of the pyramidal cell microcircuits in deep layer III of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and compensatory weakening of related GABAergic interneurons. Studies in monkeys have shown that recurrent excitation in these layer III microcircuits generates the precisely patterned, persistent firing needed for working memory and abstract thought. Importantly, excitatory synapses on layer III spines are uniquely regulated at the molecular level in ways that may render them particularly vulnerable to genetic and/or environmental insults. Glutamate actions are remarkably dependent on cholinergic stimulation, and there are inherent mechanisms to rapidly weaken connectivity, e.g. during stress. In particular, feedforward cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-calcium signaling rapidly weakens network connectivity and neuronal firing by opening nearby potassium channels. Many mechanisms that regulate this process are altered in schizophrenia and/or associated with genetic insults. Current data suggest that there are \"dual hits\" to layer III dlPFC circuits: initial insults to connectivity during the perinatal period due to genetic errors and/or inflammatory insults that predispose the cortex to atrophy, followed by a second wave of cortical loss during adolescence, e.g. driven by stress, at the descent into illness. The unique molecular regulation of layer III circuits may provide a nexus where inflammation disinhibits the neuronal response to stress. Understanding these mechanisms may help to illuminate dlPFC susceptibility in schizophrenia and provide insights for novel therapeutic targets.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of type I (CCMI) and type II (PNU120596) \u03b17 nAChR positive allosteric modulators to counteract MK-801-induced cognitive and sensorimotor gating deficits.

CCMI, PNU120596 and A582941 reversed the sensorimotor gating impairment evoked by MK-801 based on the prepulse inhibition of the startle response. Additionally, no MK-801-evoked working memory deficits were observed with \u03b17 nAChR ligand pretreatment as assessed in a discrete paired-trial delayed alternation task. However, these compounds did not affect the rats' attentional performances in the five-choice serial reaction time test. The \u03b17 nAChR agents demonstrated a beneficial effect on sensorimotor gating and some aspects of cognition tested in a rat model of schizophrenia.

Comparison of these structures with each other, as well as with the previously reported M2 and M3 receptor structures, reveals differences in the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites that contribute to a role in drug selectivity at this important receptor family.

The examined studies provided evidence suggesting that even primary and persistent negative symptoms include different psychopathological constructs, probably reflecting the dysfunction of different neurobiological substrates. Furthermore, they suggest that complex alterations in multiple neurotransmitter systems and genetic variants might influence the expression of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

Exon 6 of CHRFAM7A harbors a 2-bp deletion polymorphism, CHRFAM7A\u03942bp, which is also associated with schizophrenia. To understand the effects of the duplicated subunits on \u03b17 receptors, we fused \u03b17, dup\u03b17, and dup\u0394\u03b17 subunits with various fluorescent proteins. The duplicated subunits co-localized with full-length \u03b17 subunits in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a) as well as rat hippocampal neurons. We investigated the interaction between the duplicated subunits and full-length \u03b17 by measuring F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer using donor recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The results revealed that the duplicated proteins co-assemble with \u03b17. In electrophysiological studies, Leu at the 9'-position in the M2 membrane-spanning segment was replaced with Cys in dup\u03b17 or dup\u0394\u03b17, and constructs were co-transfected with full-length \u03b17 in Neuro2a cells. Exposure to ethylammonium methanethiosulfonate inhibited acetylcholine-induced currents, showing that the assembled functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) included the duplicated subunit. Incorporation of dup\u03b17 and dup\u0394\u03b17 subunits modestly changes the sensitivity of receptors to choline and varenicline. Thus, the duplicated proteins are assembled and transported to the cell membrane together with full-length \u03b17 subunits and alter the function of the nAChRs.

Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (CIS) accounts for the largest proportion of the poor functional outcomes in this complex syndrome, with psychosis and negative symptoms accounting for much of the rest. Current atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) e.g. amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine and risperidone, and typical APDs as well, significantly improve some, but not all aspects of CIS, including declarative memory, but not in all patients, and rarely restore normal function. Thus, finding new ways to prevent or treat CIS is a major goal of current schizophrenia research, with animal models as an essential tool. NOR in rodents is valuable in this regard because of its relationship to declarative memory, the extensive knowledge of its underlying circuitry, and the ease and reliability of assessment. Sub-chronic administration of an N-methyl-Daspartate receptor (NMDAR) non-competitive antagonist, e.g. phencyclidine (PCP), dizocilpine (MK-801) or ketamine, is a favored means to study NOR as a model of CIS, because it produces deficient glutamatergic and GABAergic function, both of which have been implicated in the development of CIS. Transgenic mice and anti-cholinergic-induced deficits in NOR have received less attention. We review here NOR studies in rodents that bear upon CIS, including the evidence that atypical, but not typical APDs, as well as specific ligands, e.g. 5-HT1A partial agonists, 5-HT7 antagonists, D1 agonists, among others, can restore NOR following sub-chronic NMDAR antagonist treatment, and can also prevent the impairment in NOR produced by sub-chronic NMDAR antagonists.

Schizophrenia is believed to result from problems during neural development that lead to improper function of synaptic transmission and plasticity, and in agreement, many of the susceptibility genes encode proteins critical for neural development. Some, however, are also expressed at high levels in adult brain. Here, we will review evidence for altered neurotransmission at glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic synapses in schizophrenia and discuss roles of susceptibility genes in neural development as well as in synaptic plasticity and how their malfunction may contribute to pathogenic mechanisms of schizophrenia.

Mesolimbic-cholinergic abnormalities are hypothesized to contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. Stimulation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAC) increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a mechanism recently demonstrated to contribute to the control of attentional performance. We determined the ability of intra-NAC administration of NMDA to increase prefrontal ACh levels in adult rats that had received bilateral infusions of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to transiently interrupt impulse flow in the ventral hippocampus (VH) during development. Rats received infusions of TTX or saline on postnatal day 7 (PD7) or day 32 (PD32), and the effects of NAC NMDA receptor stimulation on prefrontal cholinergic neurotransmission were assessed in adulthood. In animals treated as controls on PD7, NMDA increased prefrontal ACh levels by 121% above baseline. In contrast, PD7 infusions of TTX into the VH abolished the ability of NAC NMDA to activate prefrontal cholinergic neurotransmission (7% increase). In animals that received TTX infusions on PD32, NMDA-evoked cholinergic activity did not differ from controls, indicating a restricted, neonatal critical period during which VH TTX impacts the organization of mesolimbic-basal forebrain-cortical circuitry. Importantly, the failure of NAC NMDA to evoke cholinergic activity in rats treated with TTX on PD7 did not reflect a reduced excitability of corticopetal cholinergic neurons because administration of amphetamine produced similar elevations of prefrontal ACh levels in PD7 TTX and PD7 control animals. A third series of experiments demonstrated that the effects of PD7 TTX are a specific consequence of transient disruption of impulse flow in the VH. Intra-NAC NMDA evoked prefrontal ACh release in rats receiving TTX, on PD7, into the dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala, or NAC. Thus, impulse flow specifically within the VH, during a sensitive period of development, is necessary for the functional organization of a mesolimbic-cortical circuit known to mediate attentional control processes. Therefore, neonatal inactivation of VH represents an effective animal model for studying the basis of certain cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",

Importantly, the demonstration that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which result in higher synaptic levels of acetylcholine, can reduce the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia suggested that under-stimulation of cholinoceptors could be associated with the cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. This has lead to a focus on the development of receptor agonists, partial agonists and allosteric agonists that can be used to stimulate cholinergic pathways and thus reduce the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. In addition, muscarinic receptors have now been associated with the modulation of dopamine and may constitute an alternative target for the treatment of psychoses.

Stimulation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAC) increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in prefrontal cortex (PFC), an activation thought to contribute to attentional processing. Thus, the effects of intra-NAC perfusion of NMDA (250-400 microM) on ACh release in PFC were determined in rats receiving lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) as neonates (nVHLX), a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, or as adults (aVHLX). NMDA elevated ACh release (100-150% above baseline) in adults sham-lesioned as neonates or in aVHLX rats. Adult nVHLX were unresponsive to NAC NMDA receptor stimulation. The inability of nVHLX to respond to NMDA emerged over development as a separate experiment demonstrated that evoked ACh release was normal before puberty (100-150% increase) yet, in these same nVHLX animals, absent after puberty. Amphetamine-evoked ACh release was assessed in nVHLX animals to exclude potential limitations in release capacity. Amphetamine produced greater increases in ACh release than in shams, indicating that nVHLX does not impair the capacity of cholinergic neurons to release ACh. Finally, the ability of 13 days of pretreatment with clozapine (1.25 mg/kg/day) to reinstate NMDA-evoked cortical ACh efflux was determined. Clozapine treatment normalized NMDA-evoked ACh release in nVHLX animals. These experiments show that mesolimbic regulation of cortical ACh release is disrupted in postpubertal nVHLX rats and normalized by low-dose treatment of clozapine; supporting the usefulness of nVHLX animals for research on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",

Specifically, it refers to the observation that organisms that receive nonreinforced preexposure to the to-be conditioned stimulus are less efficient in generating a conditioned response to that stimulus when it is subsequently paired with reinforcement. Because dysfunction of attentional selectivity is a fundamental deficit associated with schizophrenia, disrupted LI is long considered to model attentional abnormalities in schizophrenia. Here we show that different pharmacological manipulations can produce two poles of abnormality in LI: disrupted LI under conditions which yield LI in non-treated rats, and abnormally persistent LI under conditions which disrupt LI in non-treated rats. We describe several distinct LI models based upon the manipulation used to alter the expression of LI, the direction of LI abnormality, and responsiveness to typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) as well as other schizophrenia-relevant treatments: DA agonist; DA antagonist; NMDA antagonist; and muscarinic antagonist. We tentatively suggest that these models represent four domains of pathology in schizophrenia: DA agonist and muscarinic antagonist-induced disrupted LI represents a domain of positive symptoms that respond to typical and atypical APDs and some cognitive enhancers; NMDA antagonist-induced persistent LI represents a domain of negative/cognitive symptoms that respond to atypical APDs and cognitive enhancers but not typical APDs; antimuscarinic-induced persistent LI represents a domain of cognitive symptoms that are responsive to cognitive enhancers but are resistant to typical and atypical APDs; finally, DA antagonist-induced persistent LI represents a domain of negative symptoms that are treatable by atypical APDs but are resistant to cognitive enhancers.",

Decreases in cortical KYNA levels were achieved by local perfusion of S-ESBA, a selective inhibitor of the astrocytic enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), which catalyses the formation of KYNA from its precursor L-kynurenine. At 5 mm, S-ESBA caused a 30% reduction in extracellular KYNA levels, which was accompanied by a two-threefold increase in basal cortical ACh levels. Co-perfusion of KYNA in the endogenous range (100 nm), which by itself tended to reduce basal ACh levels, blocked the ability of S-ESBA to raise extracellular ACh levels. KYNA perfusion (100 nm) also prevented the evoked ACh release caused by d-amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg). This effect was duplicated by the systemic administration of kynurenine (50 mg/kg), which resulted in a significant increase in cortical KYNA formation. Jointly, these data indicate that astrocytes, by producing and releasing KYNA, have the ability to modulate cortical cholinergic neurotransmission under both basal and stimulated conditions. As cortical KYNA levels are elevated in individuals with schizophrenia, and in light of the established role of cortical ACh in executive functions, our findings suggest that drugs capable of attenuating the production of KYNA may be of benefit in the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",

        "title": "Dysconnection in schizophrenia: from abnormal synaptic plasticity to failures of self-monitoring.",
        "abstract": "Over the last 2 decades, a large number of neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have furnished in vivo evidence for dysconnectivity, ie, abnormal functional integration of brain processes. While the evidence for dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is strong, its etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and significance for clinical symptoms are unclear. First, dysconnectivity could result from aberrant wiring of connections during development, from aberrant synaptic plasticity, or from both. Second, it is not clear how schizophrenic symptoms can be understood mechanistically as a consequence of dysconnectivity. Third, if dysconnectivity is the primary pathophysiology, and not just an epiphenomenon, then it should provide a mechanistic explanation for known empirical facts about schizophrenia. This article addresses these 3 issues in the framework of the dysconnection hypothesis. This theory postulates that the core pathology in schizophrenia resides in aberrant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic plasticity due to abnormal regulation of NMDARs by neuromodulatory transmitters like dopamine, serotonin, or acetylcholine. We argue that this neurobiological mechanism can explain failures of self-monitoring, leading to a mechanistic explanation for first-rank symptoms as pathognomonic features of schizophrenia, and may provide a basis for future diagnostic classifications with physiologically defined patient subgroups. Finally, we test the explanatory power of our theory against a list of empirical facts about schizophrenia.",
