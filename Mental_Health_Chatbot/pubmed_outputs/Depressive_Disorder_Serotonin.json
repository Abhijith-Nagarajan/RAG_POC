        "title": "Evaluation of Nanocurcumin Effects on Depressive-Like Behaviors in Rats and Determination of Serum BDNF and Serotonin Levels.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric condition worldwide, and it is the leading cause of disability globally. Turmeric, an aromatic perennial herb widely used in traditional Asian medicine and cuisine, contains curcumin, which has several biological effects, including a pseudoantidepressant effect. However, curcumin's low bioavailability limits its effectiveness. This study evaluated nanocurcumin (NCUR) effects on depressive-like behaviors and examined serum BDNF and serotonin levels in a chronic stress model in rats. Behavioral assessments and biochemical indicators elucidated NCUR's antidepressant-like properties. In this experimental study, 30 adult male rats were randomly divided into six groups and exposed to unexpected chronic mild stress (UCMS). The groups included: control (CG), stress control (SCG), fluoxetine (FLU) treatment (20\u00a0mg/kg), and three NCUR doses (20, 40, and 80\u00a0mg/kg). Before UCMS exposure, rats underwent a sucrose preference test (SPT). Depressive behaviors were then assessed using the open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST) on days 27 and 28. Blood samples were collected on day 28 to measure serum Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NCUR treatment significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors in stressed rats. The sucrose preference index of the SCG decreased after 26 days of stress, while NCUR (all doses) and FLU reversed this effect. In the FST and TST, immobility time was significantly reduced in the NCUR and FLU groups compared to the SCG (p < 0.05). The OFT also showed that the SCG had significantly fewer crossings compared to treated groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, NCUR treatment significantly increased serum BDNF and serotonin levels compared to the SCG. This study demonstrates that NCUR exerts antidepressant-like effects, improving depressive behaviors and increasing BDNF and serotonin levels in rats exposed to chronic stress. NCUR may offer a promising alternative for the treatment of MDD.",

        "abstract": "To explore the potential of combining natural herbs like chamomile and saffron for the management of anxiety and depression. A rodent model of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety, secondary to streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus was made. A total of 6 rat groups were chosen; healthy and diseased controls; and diseased test groups of fluoxetine, saffron, chamomile, and combined saffron and chamomile treated (<i>n =</i> 6/group). Activity by forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and correlations with biochemical markers like serum glucose, tryptophan, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydrox-ytryptamine 2C receptor (5HT2CR) expression, were assessed at the end of the 3rd week of the treatment. A one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test was applied. The combined herbal treatment group showed significantly better (<i>P <</i>0.05) than all other groups in terms of anti-hyperglycemic effect. All treatments improved the CRP levels; however, the combination group was also significantly better than fluoxetine and the individual herb groups. Only the herb groups showed efficacy in the FST with added benefits of the combination group over the healthy controls and similar trends in the EPMT. However, expression of 5HT2CR was repressed while BDNF was elevated through treatment. This study shows that in comparison to treatment with a SSRI, and individual herbs, the combination of chamomile and saffron showed overall improved outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most common mental disorders worldwide and is characterized by dysregulated reward processing associated with anhedonia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for MDD; however, their onset of action is delayed. Recent reports have shown that serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are activated by rewards and play a vital role in reward processing. However, whether antidepressant treatment affects the DRN serotonin neuronal response to rewards in awake animals remains unknown. In this study, we measured the activity of DRN serotonin neurons in awake mice and determined the effects of antidepressants and chronic stress on DRN serotonin neuronal activity. We found that acute treatment with citalopram, an SSRI, significantly decreased sucrose-induced activation of DRN serotonin neurons. The decrease in response to acute citalopram treatment was attenuated by chronic citalopram treatment. Acute treatment with (S)-WAY100135, a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist, dose-dependently inhibited the response to acute citalopram treatment. These results indicate that autoinhibition by activating 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors via acute SSRI treatment may blunt the reward response, which can be recovered after chronic SSRI treatment.",

In this exploratory study, we employed an electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics platform to assess the metabolic effects of three randomly-assigned treatments: escitalopram, duloxetine, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in 163 treatment-na\u00efve outpatients with major depressive disorder. Serum samples from baseline and 12\u00a0weeks post-treatment were analyzed using targeted liquid chromatography-electrochemistry for metabolites related to tryptophan, tyrosine metabolism and related pathways. Changes in metabolite concentrations related to each treatment arm were identified and compared to define metabolic signatures of exposure. In addition, association between metabolites and depressive symptom severity (assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD<sub>17</sub>]) and anxiety symptom severity (assessed with the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HRSA<sub>14</sub>]) were evaluated, both at baseline and after 12\u00a0weeks of treatment. Significant reductions in serum serotonin level and increases in tryptophan-derived indoles that are gut bacterially derived were observed with escitalopram and duloxetine arms but not in CBT arm. These include indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) and Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin. Purine-related metabolites were decreased across all arms. Different metabolites correlated with improved symptoms in the different treatment arms revealing potentially different mechanisms between response to antidepressant medications and to CBT.",

        "abstract": "The therapeutic targeting of the intestinal microbiota has gained increasing attention as a promising avenue for addressing mood disorders. This study aimed to assess the potential effect of supplementing standard pharmacological treatment with the probiotic kefir in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Thirty-eight female participants diagnosed with moderate MDD by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) were selected to receive the probiotic kefir in conjunction with antidepressant therapy for 12 weeks. The participants were evaluated at baseline (T0) and 90 days after probiotic kefir supplementation (T90). HAM-D scores and blood samples were collected at both time points. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduced MDD severity, as evidenced by lower HAM-D scores compared to baseline. Probiotic consumption for 90 days also significantly decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels compared to baseline. However, probiotic kefir supplementation did not significantly affect serum serotonin levels. Additionally, after 90 days of probiotic consumption, insulin and morning cortisol levels were significantly reduced. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in serum levels of prolactin, vitamin D, and afternoon cortisol. This study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of probiotics, specifically kefir, as adjunctive therapy for female patients with MDD. The findings highlight promising results in ameliorating depressive symptoms and modulating inflammatory and hormonal markers.",

        "abstract": "Unlike classical antidepressants, psychedelics such as psilocybin have been shown to induce a rapid antidepressant response. In the wake of this development, interest has emerged in ultra-fast, short-acting psychedelics such as 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with the expectation that these can produce rapid antidepressant effects following an intense but brief psychedelic intervention. The current paper reviews the clinical pharmacology of 5-MeO-DMT and DMT and their potential benefits and challenges in the treatment of depression. Both compounds display affinities for a variety of monoamine receptors and transporters, but mostly so for serotonergic (5HT) receptors, including 5HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5HT<sub>2A</sub>. Early clinical trials in small samples have shown that short interventions (15-30 min) with 5-MeO-DMT and DMT are safe and well tolerated and can induce marked improvement in symptoms of depression within 24 hours that sustain for at least 1 week. Data on long-term efficacy are currently scarce but do suggest a prolongation of the treatment response. Potential benefits of these treatments include flexible, single day dosing regimens, achievement of treatment efficacy independent from integrative therapy, and ease of clinical implementation. Future challenges include establishing the duration of the antidepressant effect and strategies on how to sustain the antidepressant response, optimization of treatment delivery parameters, and a mechanistic understanding of the clinical response. Acceptance of ultra-fast, short-acting psychedelics will depend on future randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a focus on replication, duration and maintenance of antidepressant efficacy in large patient samples.",

        "abstract": "The development of postpartum depression has been linked to fluctuations in the levels of neurotransmitters in the human body, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (Norepinephrine, NE), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research has indicated that the antidepressant effect of esketamine are mediated by monoamine transmitters and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we postulate that intravenous administration of esketamine in patients with postpartum depression may alter the serum concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Three hundred fifteen patients with postpartum depression were selected and divided into two groups based on randomized numerical expression: esketamine (E) group (0. 25\u00a0mg/kg esketamine) and control (C) group (a same volume of 0.9% saline), all the drugs were pumped for 40\u00a0min. After the end of drug pumping, all patients were continuously observed for 2\u00a0h. Changes in serum levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, BDNF were recorded before drug administration and on the 3rd day after drug administration. The scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were calculated before drug administration, and on the 3rd day and on the 30th day after drug administration. Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and feeling of detachment occurred were recorded within 2\u00a0h after drug administration.

        "abstract": "Over time, several studies have been conducted to demonstrate the functions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), better known as serotonin. This neurotransmitter is associated with the modulation of various social and physiological behaviors, and its dysregulation has consequences at the behavioral level, leading to various neurophysiological disorders. Disorders such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, sexual disorders, and eating disorders, have been closely linked to variations in 5-HT concentrations and modifications in brain structures, including the raphe nuclei (RN), prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, among others. The involvement of \u03b2-arrestin proteins has been implicated in the modulation of the serotonergic receptor response, as well as the activation of different signaling pathways related to the serotonergic system, this is particularly relevant in depressive disorders. This review will cover the implications of alterations in 5-HT receptor expression in depressive disorders in one hand and how \u03b2-arrestin proteins modulate the response mediated by these receptors in the other hand.",

        "abstract": "Mood disorders are an enigmatic class of debilitating illnesses that affect millions of individuals worldwide. While chronic stress clearly increases incidence levels of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), stress-mediated disruptions in brain function that precipitate these illnesses remain largely elusive. Serotonin-associated antidepressants (ADs) remain the first line of therapy for many with depressive symptoms, yet low remission rates and delays between treatment and symptomatic alleviation have prompted skepticism regarding direct roles for serotonin in the precipitation and treatment of affective disorders. Our group recently demonstrated that serotonin epigenetically modifies histone proteins (H3K4me3Q5ser) to regulate transcriptional permissiveness in brain. However, this non-canonical phenomenon has not yet been explored following stress and/or AD exposures. Here, we employed a combination of genome-wide and biochemical analyses in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of male and female mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress, as well as in DRN of human MDD patients, to examine the impact of stress exposures/MDD diagnosis on H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics, as well as associations between the mark and depression-related gene expression. We additionally assessed stress-induced/MDD-associated regulation of H3K4me3Q5ser following AD exposures, and employed viral-mediated gene therapy in mice to reduce H3K4me3Q5ser levels in DRN and examine its impact on stress-associated gene expression and behavior. We found that H3K4me3Q5ser plays important roles in stress-mediated transcriptional plasticity. Chronically stressed mice displayed dysregulated H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics in DRN, with both AD- and viral-mediated disruption of these dynamics proving sufficient to attenuate stress-mediated gene expression and behavior. Corresponding patterns of H3K4me3Q5ser regulation were observed in MDD subjects on vs. off ADs at their time of death. These findings thus establish a neurotransmission-independent role for serotonin in stress-/AD-associated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity, observations of which may be of clinical relevance to human MDD and its treatment.",

        "abstract": "The serotonin deficit hypothesis explanation for major depressive disorder (MDD) has persisted among clinicians and the general public alike despite insufficient supporting evidence. To combat rising mental health crises and eroding public trust in science and medicine, researchers and clinicians must be able to communicate to patients and the public an updated framework of MDD: one that is (1) accessible to a general audience, (2) accurately integrates current evidence about the efficacy of conventional serotonergic antidepressants with broader and deeper understandings of pathophysiology and treatment, and (3) capable of accommodating new evidence. In this article, we summarize a framework for the pathophysiology and treatment of MDD that is informed by clinical and preclinical research in psychiatry and neuroscience. First, we discuss how MDD can be understood as inflexibility in cognitive and emotional brain circuits that involves a persistent negativity bias. Second, we discuss how effective treatments for MDD enhance mechanisms of neuroplasticity-including via serotonergic interventions-to restore synaptic, network, and behavioral function in ways that facilitate adaptive cognitive and emotional processing. These treatments include typical monoaminergic antidepressants, novel antidepressants like ketamine and psychedelics, and psychotherapy and neuromodulation techniques. At the end of the article, we discuss this framework from the perspective of effective science communication and provide useful language and metaphors for researchers, clinicians, and other professionals discussing MDD with a general or patient audience.",

        "abstract": "Depression is a mood disorder that may increase risk for the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and vice versa. However, the mechanistic pathway linking depression and T2D is not fully elucidated. The aim of this narrative review, therefore, was to discuss the possible link between depression and T2D. The coexistence of T2D and depression is twice as great compared to the occurrence of either condition independently. Hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia promote the incidence of depression by enhancing inflammation and reducing brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5HT]). Dysregulation of insulin signalling in T2D impairs brain 5HT signalling, leading to the development of depression. Furthermore, depression is associated with the development of hyperglycaemia and poor glycaemic control. Psychological stress and depression promote the development of T2D. In conclusion, T2D could be a potential risk factor for the development of depression through the induction of inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress that affect brain neurotransmission. In addition, chronic stress in depression may induce the development of T2D through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increase circulating cortisol levels, which triggers IR and T2D.",

Dysfunction of Nav1.1 activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) of adolescent mice enhanced the local excitation/inhibition ratio, resulting in epileptic activity, cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviour in adulthood, along with a gene expression profile linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). Additionally, it reduced extracellular serotonin concentration in the dorsal raphe nucleus and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the hippocampus, two MDD-related brain areas beyond the PFC. We also observed alterations in oscillatory activity and impaired hippocampal-mPFC coherence during sleep. Finally, we found reduced expression levels of SCN1A, the gene encoding Nav1.1, in post-mortem PFC samples from human MDD subjects.

        "abstract": "Depression's link to serotonin dysregulation is well-known. The monoamine theory posits that depression results from impaired serotonin activity, leading to the development of antidepressants targeting serotonin levels. However, their limited efficacy suggests a more complex cause. Recent studies highlight mitochondria as key players in depression's pathophysiology. Mounting evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction significantly correlates with major depressive disorder (MDD), underscoring its pivotal role in depression. Exploring the serotonin-mitochondrial connection, our study investigated the effects of chronic serotonin treatment on induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and neurons from healthy controls and two case study patients. One was a patient with antidepressant non-responding MDD (\"Non-R\") and another had a non-genetic mitochondrial disorder (\"Mito\"). The results revealed that serotonin altered the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function and dynamics in neurons and had an equalizing effect on calcium homeostasis in astrocytes, while ATP levels seemed increased. Serotonin significantly decreased cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium in neurons. Electrophysiological measurements evidenced that serotonin depolarized the resting membrane potential, increased both sodium and potassium current density and ultimately improved the overall excitability of neurons. Specifically, neurons from the Non-R patient appeared responsive to serotonin in vitro, which seemed to improve neurotransmission. While it is unclear how this translates to the systemic level and AD resistance mechanisms are not fully elucidated, our observations show that despite his treatment resistance, this patient's cortical neurons are responsive to serotonergic signals. In the Mito patient, evidence suggested that serotonin, by increasing excitability, exacerbated an existing hyperexcitability highlighting the importance of considering mitochondrial disorders in patients with MDD, and avoiding serotonin-increasing medication. Taken together, our findings suggested that serotonin positively affects calcium homeostasis in astrocytes and increases neuronal excitability. The latter effect must be considered carefully, as it could have beneficial or detrimental implications based on individual pathologies.",

The combined therapy rapidly acts on VaDep comorbid with anxiety and somatic symptoms and significantly alleviates the anxiety and somatic symptoms. The plasma levels of 5-HT may serve as potential objective candidates in evaluating VaDep severity and the efficacy of the undertaken treatment regimen.",

        "title": "Affective disorders and the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential: Serotonin and beyond.",
        "abstract": "Identifying additional noninvasive biomarkers for affective disorders, such as unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), could aid in the diagnosis and treatment of these prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric conditions. One such candidate biomarker is the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), an event-related potential that measures responsiveness of the auditory cortex to different intensities of sound. The LDAEP has been associated with MDD and BD, including therapeutic response to particular classes of antidepressant drugs, while also correlating with several other neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been suggested that increased values of the LDAEP indicate low central serotonergic neurotransmission, further implicating this EEG measure in depression. Here, we briefly review the literature on the LDAEP in affective disorders, including its association with serotonergic signaling, as well as with that of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine. We summarize key findings on the LDAEP and the genetics of these neurotransmitters, as well as prediction of response to particular classes of antidepressants in MDD, including SSRIs versus noradrenergic agents. The possible relationship between this EEG measure and suicidality is addressed. We also briefly analyze acute pharmacologic studies of serotonin and/or dopamine precursor depletion and the LDAEP. In conclusion, the existing literature suggests that serotonin and norepinephrine may modulate the LDAEP in an opposing manner, and that this event-related marker may be of use in predicting response to chronic treatment with particular pharmacologic agents in the context of affective disorders, such as MDD and BD, including in the presence of suicidality.",

        "title": "The role of serotonin in depression-A historical roundup and future directions.",
        "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 280 million people, with probably much higher unrecorded cases. Depression is associated with symptoms such as anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, sleep disturbances, and even suicidal thoughts. Tragically, more than 700\u2009000 people commit suicide each year. Although depression has been studied for many decades, the exact mechanisms that lead to depression are still unknown, and available treatments only help a fraction of patients. In the late 1960s, the serotonin hypothesis was published, suggesting that serotonin is the key player in depressive disorders. However, this hypothesis is being increasingly doubted as there is evidence for the influence of other neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as larger systemic causes such as altered activity in the limbic network or inflammatory processes. In this narrative review, we aim to contribute to the ongoing debate on the involvement of serotonin in depression. We will review the evolution of antidepressant treatments, systemic research on depression over the years, and future research applications that will help to bridge the gap between systemic research and neurotransmitter dynamics using biosensors. These new tools in combination with systemic applications, will in the future provide a deeper understanding of the serotonergic dynamics in depression.",

        "title": "Exploring Novel Antidepressants Targeting G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Key Membrane Receptors Based on Molecular Structures.",
        "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a complex mental disorder that involves alterations in signal transmission across multiple scales and structural abnormalities. The development of effective antidepressants (ADs) has been hindered by the dominance of monoamine hypothesis, resulting in slow progress. Traditional ADs have undesirable traits like delayed onset of action, limited efficacy, and severe side effects. Recently, two categories of fast-acting antidepressant compounds have surfaced, dissociative anesthetics S-ketamine and its metabolites, as well as psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). This has led to structural research and drug development of the receptors that they target. This review provides breakthroughs and achievements in the structure of depression-related receptors and novel ADs based on these. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has enabled researchers to identify the structures of membrane receptors, including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) receptor. These high-resolution structures can be used for the development of novel ADs using virtual drug screening (VDS). Moreover, the unique antidepressant effects of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in various brain regions, and the pivotal roles of the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TrkB) in regulating synaptic plasticity, emphasize their potential as therapeutic targets. Using structural information, a series of highly selective ADs were designed based on the different role of receptors in MDD. These molecules have the favorable characteristics of rapid onset and low adverse drug reactions. This review offers researchers guidance and a methodological framework for the structure-based design of ADs.",

        "abstract": "Depressive disorders are a common and debilitating form of mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying causes and mechanisms of depressive disorders are still poorly understood. Neurochemical systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, have been implicated in the development and perpetuation of depressive symptoms. Current treatments for depression target these neuromodulator systems, but there is a need for a better understanding of their role in order to develop more effective treatments. Monitoring neurochemical dynamics during depressive symptoms is crucial for gaining a better a understanding of their involvement in depressive disorders. Genetically encoded sensors have emerged recently that offer high spatial-temporal resolution and the ability to monitor neurochemical dynamics in real time. This review explores the neurochemical systems involved in depression and discusses the applications and limitations of current monitoring tools for neurochemical dynamics. It also highlights the potential of genetically encoded sensors for better characterizing neurochemical dynamics in depression-related behaviors. Furthermore, potential improvements to current sensors are discussed in order to meet the requirements of depression research.",

        "title": "Antidepressant-like effects of psychedelics in a chronic despair mouse model: is the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor the unique player?",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders in the world. First-line treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) still have many limitations, including a resistance to treatment in 30% of patients and a delayed clinical benefit that is observed only after several weeks of treatment. Increasing clinical evidence indicates that the acute administration of psychedelic agonists of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R), such as psilocybin, to patients with MDD induce fast antidepressant effects, which persist up to five weeks after the treatment. However, the involvement of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in these antidepressant effects remains controversial. Furthermore, whether the hallucinogenic properties of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R agonists are mandatory to their antidepressant activity is still an open question. Here, we addressed these issues by investigating the effect of two psychedelics of different chemical families, DOI and psilocybin, and a non-hallucinogenic 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R agonist, lisuride, in a chronic despair mouse model exhibiting a robust depressive-like phenotype. We show that a single injection of each drug to wild type mice induces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in the novelty-suppressed feeding, sucrose preference and forced swim tests, which last up to 15 days. DOI and lisuride administration did not produce antidepressant-like effects in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas psilocybin was still effective. Moreover, neither 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R blockade nor dopamine D<sub>1</sub> or D<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade affected the antidepressant-like effects of psilocybin in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R agonists can produce antidepressant-like effects independently of hallucinogenic properties through mechanisms involving or not involving the receptor.",
