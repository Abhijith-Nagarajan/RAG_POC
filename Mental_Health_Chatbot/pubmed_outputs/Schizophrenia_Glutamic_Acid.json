        "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental disorder which are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, catatonic behavior, negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms. Several gene polymorphisms and neurotransmitters have been linked to schizophrenia. This study assessed the correlation between proline level, Kynurenic Acid (KYNA) and glutamate level with cognitive function among schizophrenia patients, contributing to understanding biochemical factors associated with cognitive impairments. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The research was a cross-sectional observational analytic study of 99 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was diagnosed by SCID-1 questionnaire and the patient's blood was taken to be analyzed in the Biochemical Laboratory of Medical Faculty Andalas University using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to characterize kynurenic acid level, glutamate level and proline level. Data were analyzed using Spearman Correlation in SPSS 25.0, with significance at p<0.05. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; There were 99 schizophrenia patients; most of them were male (62.6%), age median 37 years old and not married (50.5%). The Microproline Level median among participants was 2.64 \u03bcg/mL, the median KYNA level was 14.6 nmol/L and the glutamate level was 10.5 \u03bcg/mL. Cognitive function was assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Digit Span Test and Trail Making Test (TMT) with a score median of 4/5/5/5 (Trial 1/2/3/Recall), 6/2 (forward/backward), 68/37 sec (TMT A/B), respectively. Spearman Correlation showed that microproline has a negative correlation with RAVLT Trial 1 (r = -0.221, p = 0.014), Digit Span Backward (r = -0.181, p = 0.036), TMT A (r = 0.204, p = 0.021) and TMT B (r = 0.185, p = 0.034). In contrast, other neurotransmitters do not correlate with any cognitive tests. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Proline may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.",

        "title": "Glutamate-Based Therapeutic Strategies for Schizophrenia: Emerging Approaches Beyond Dopamine.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder composed of primary cluster-positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganization, neurocognitive deficits, and social cognitive impairments. While traditional antipsychotics primarily target dopamine pathways, they provide limited efficacy against cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Growing evidence implicates glutamatergic dysregulation, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) hypofunction, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, making glutamate modulation a promising therapeutic approach. This review explores emerging glutamate-based treatment strategies, including NMDA receptor modulators, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agents, glutamate transporter regulators, and kynurenine pathway inhibitors. We summarize preclinical and clinical findings on NMDA co-agonists (D-serine and glycine), glycine transporter inhibitors, D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors, and mGluR-targeted therapies, highlighting their mechanisms, efficacy, and limitations. In addition, we discuss novel interventions aimed at restoring glutamate homeostasis, including neuroinflammatory modulation and synaptic plasticity enhancers. Despite promising results, many glutamate-targeting therapies have yielded inconsistent clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and optimized treatment protocols. We propose that integrating glutamate modulators with existing antipsychotic regimens may enhance therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Future research should focus on refining glutamate-based interventions, identifying predictive biomarkers, and addressing the heterogeneity in schizophrenia pathology. With continued advancements, glutamate modulation has the potential to transform schizophrenia treatment, particularly for cognitive and negative symptoms that remain largely unaddressed by current therapies.",

        "abstract": "Depicting spatial distributions of disease-relevant cells is crucial for understanding disease pathology<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes. Our study provides a method for spatially resolved mapping of trait-associated cells and demonstrates the gain of biological insights (such as the spatial distribution of trait-relevant cells and related signature genes) through these maps.",

        "title": "The Relationship of glutamate signaling to cannabis use and schizophrenia.",
        "abstract": "This review examines the literature associating cannabis with schizophrenia, glutamate dysregulation in schizophrenia, and cannabis involvement in glutamate pathways. Cannabis use is widespread among adolescents world-wide and is sold legally in many countries for recreational use in a variety of forms. Most people use it without lasting effects, but a portion of individuals have negative reactions that manifest in acute psychotic symptoms, and in some, symptoms continue even after the use of cannabis has ceased. To date, there is a huge gap in our understanding of why this occurs. Recent studies have focused on abnormalities in the glutamate pathway in schizophrenia, the effect of cannabis on the glutamate system, and the role of glutamate in the brain Default Mode Network. Given these observations, we hypothesize that perturbance of glutamate neuronal connectivity by cannabis in the brains of individuals genetically at high risk for psychosis will initiate a schizophrenia-like psychosis. Future studies may tie together these diverse observations by combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the default resting state network in patients with new onset schizophrenia who do and do not use cannabis compared with nonpsychotic individuals who do and do not use cannabis.",

        "abstract": "Loss of glutamatergic terminals is hypothesised to contribute to excitation-inhibition imbalance in schizophrenia, supported by evidence that the normal positive association between glutamate concentrations and synaptic terminal density is not found in patients with chronic schizophrenia. However, it is unknown whether the relationship between synaptic terminal density and glutamate levels is altered early in the course of illness. To address this, we investigated [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J distribution volume ratio (DVR) and glutamatergic markers in healthy volunteers (HV) and in antipsychotic-na\u00efve/free patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) recruited from first-episode psychosis services.

In the HV but not SCZ group, [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J DVR was significantly positively associated with Glu/Cr (Spearman's rho = 0.55, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and Glx/Cr (Spearman's rho = 0.73, p\u2009=\u20090.0004) in the ACC, and with Glu/Cr in the left hippocampus (Spearman's rho = 0.77, p\u2009=\u20090.0001). DVR was significantly lower in the ACC in the SCZ group compared to the HV group (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z\u2009=\u20091.44, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Together, these findings indicate that the normal relationship between levels of a synaptic terminal density marker and levels of glutamate is disrupted early in the course of schizophrenia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that there is loss of glutamatergic terminals at illness onset.",

        "title": "Impact of neuroinflammation on brain glutamate and dopamine signalling in schizophrenia: an update.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Over the years, numerous treatment options have been introduced for schizophrenia. Although they are relatively successful in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, most of the current treatments have a negligible effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms. Thus, none of them could prevent the relapse of psychotic episodes. Among the numerous hypotheses explaining the development and progression of schizophrenia, the cytokine hypothesis explains the role of inflammatory markers as a significant culprit in the development of schizophrenia. Elevated cytokines are reported in animal models and schizophrenic patients. The cytokine hypothesis is based on how increased inflammatory markers can cause changes in the dopaminergic, glutamate, and tryptophan metabolism pathways, like that observed in schizophrenic patients. Reasons, such as autoimmune disease, maternal immune activation, infection, etc., can pave the way for the development of schizophrenia and are associated with the negative, positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, there is a need to focus on the significance of anti-inflammatory drugs against these symptoms. The development of new treatment strategies in the management of schizophrenia can provide better therapeutic outcomes in terms of the severity of symptoms and treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenia. This review attempts to explain the association between elevated inflammatory markers and various neurotransmitters, and the possible use of medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, statins, and estrogens as adjuvant therapy. Over the years, these hypotheses have been the basis for drug discovery for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Elevated risk for schizophrenia is associated with a variation in the <i>DTNBP1</i> gene encoding dysbindin-1, which may underpin cognitive impairments in this prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve anomalies in glutamate and dopamine signaling, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Indeed, mice with <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations exhibit spatial and working memory deficits that are associated with deficits in glutamate release and NMDA receptor function as determined by slice electrophysiology. The present study extended the results from ex vivo approaches by examining how the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation impacts high K+- and NMDA receptor-evoked glutamate release within the PFC using in vivo microdialysis procedures. <i>Dntbp1</i> mutant mice are also reported to exhibit blunted K+-evoked dopamine release within the PFC. Thus, we examined also K+- and NMDA-evoked dopamine release within this region. Perfusion of high-concentration K+ or NMDA solutions increased the PFC levels of both dopamine and glutamate in wild-type (WT) but not in <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutants (MUT), whereas mice heterozygous for the <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutation (HET) exhibited blunted K+-evoked dopamine release. No net-flux microdialysis procedures confirmed elevated basal extracellular content of both glutamate and dopamine within the PFC of HET and MUT mice. These in vivo microdialysis results corroborate prior indications that <i>Dtnbp1</i> mutations perturb evoked dopamine and glutamate release within the PFC, provide in vivo evidence for impaired NMDA receptor function within the PFC, and suggest that these neurochemical anomalies may be related to abnormally elevated basal neurotransmitter content.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder that is marked by hallucinations and cognitive impairments. Ferroptosis is a type of cell death that is associated with iron and lipid peroxidation; it may play a role in SZ etiology. The present study aimed to explore the correlations between ferroptosis-related genes and SZ in three brain regions. We used the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE80655 to analyze brain samples from SZ patients and controls; specifically, we evaluated the anterior cingulate cortex (Ancg), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and nucleus accumbens (nAcc). The data were preprocessed in R, and ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Pearson correlation analysis was then performed to assess correlations between these DEGs and age at death, postmortem interval, or brain pH. To identify important ferroptosis-related genes, we created a protein-protein interaction network using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and visualized it using Cytoscape software. Moreover, the pROC package was used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for these important genes. Finally, gene set variation analysis was used for the pathway enrichment analysis of ferroptosis-related pathways, followed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Nine ferroptosis-related DEGs were upregulated in the Ancg region and one was downregulated in the nAcc region. In the Ancg region, the SZ group had four ferroptosis-related DEGs that were negatively correlated with postmortem interval, and the control group had five ferroptosis-related DEGs that were negatively correlated with brain pH. The protein-protein interaction network analysis of the Ancg region revealed seven significant interacting genes; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and galectin 3 (LGALS3) were the hub genes. Gene set variation analysis revealed substantial changes in the glycolysis pathway in the Ancg region, and in the glutamate transmembrane transport pathway and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis process pathway in the nAcc region, in SZ patients compared with controls. The correlation between ferroptosis and SZ appears to be stronger in the Ancg than in the nAcc or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This association may be mediated by TIMP1 and LGALS3 as well as by the glycolysis pathway, indicating that these might be possible biomarkers for SZ.",

Fifteen uTRS participants and 19 healthy controls underwent 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to measure glutamate levels in the OCC. Cognitive performance was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). No significant differences in OCC glutamate levels were found between uTRS participants and healthy controls. uTRS participants performed significantly worse on the MCCB compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size (\u03b7\u00b2 = 0.72). Although no significant direct relationships were observed between Glu levels and cognitive performance, significant regression models for certain cognitive domains suggest a modest association between Glu levels and cognitive outcomes. Participants with uTRS exhibited significant cognitive deficits compared to healthy controls, though no significant differences in OCC Glu levels were found. While no clear linear or quadratic relationships emerged, Glu explained a small portion of the variance in cognitive performance, indicating a more complex role for Glu in cognition that warrants further investigation.",

Twenty-one patients with early-stage psychotic disorders and 18 HC participants underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans and cognitive assessments before and after administration of intranasal insulin 40 IU. We conducted proton MRS (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) in the prefrontal cortex at 4T to measure GSH and glutamate metabolites. We assessed cognition using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia symbol coding, digit sequencing, and verbal fluency tasks, in addition to the Stroop task. The mean (SD) age of participants was 25.7 (4.6) years; 51.3% were female. There were no significant group differences at baseline in age, sex, body mass index, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), or cognition. Patients had higher baseline GSH (p < .001) and glutamate (p\u00a0= .007). After insulin administration, GSH increased in HC participants (mean change, 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.26; p\u00a0= .015), but not in patients. Symbol coding improved in both patients (0.74; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.11; p < .001) and HC participants (0.83; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.09; p < .001), and verbal fluency improved in HC participants (0.43; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72; p\u00a0= .006).

        "abstract": "Treatment-resistance in patients with schizophrenia is a major obstacle for improving outcome in patients, especially in those not gaining from clozapine. Novel research implies that glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities may be present in treatment-resistant patients, and preclinical research suggests that clozapine affects the GABAergic system. Moreover, clozapine may have a neuroprotective role. To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the relationship between clozapine and in vivo measures of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (glu), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) brain levels in treatment- and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients (TRS and UTRS). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we included three longitudinal and six cross sectional studies utilizing proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) that explored brain metabolite levels in clozapine-treated patients. Findings were limited by a small number of studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn, but the present studies may imply that clozapine reduces glutamate levels in striatal but not cortical areas, whereas glutamatergic metabolites and GABA levels may be increased in ACC in the combined group of TRS and UTRS. Clozapine may also increase NAA in cortical areas. Importantly, this review highlights the need for further clinical studies investigating the effect of clozapine on brain levels of glutamate, GABA, and NAA as well as metabolite group differences in patients with UTRS compared with TRS.",

We sought to investigate whether people with genetic high risk (GHR) for schizophrenia have lower glutamate levels in the ACC than those at later stages of clinical high risk (CHR) and those with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), among whom symptoms are already prominent. We recruited people with CHR, GHR, or FES, as well as healthy controls. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined glutamate levels in the perigenual ACC (pACC) and dorsal ACC (dACC) using a 3 T scanner. We recruited 302 people across multiple stages of psychosis, including 63 with CHR, 76 with GHR, and 96 with FES, as well as 67 healthy controls. Those with GHR had lower glutamate levels in the dACC than those with CHR, while those with CHR had higher glutamate levels in the pACC than those with FES. Higher disorganization, but not any other symptom domain, was associated with lower levels of glutamate in the GHR group (dACC and pACC) and in the CHR group (pACC). The cross-sectional design precluded inferences regarding individual clinical trajectory and resolution at 3 T was insufficient to separate spectra of glutamine from glutamate. Reduced glutamatergic tone among people genetically predisposed to schizophrenia supports diminished excitability as an early feature of schizophrenia, contributing to the subtle symptom of disorganization across high-risk states. Higher glutamate levels become apparent when psychotic symptoms become prominent, possibly as a disinhibitory effect and, at the full-blown stage of psychosis, the relationship between glutamate concentrations and symptoms ceases to be simply linear.",

Although our previous work found that Opcml promotes spine maturation and Opcml-deficient mice exhibit schizophrenia-related cognitive impairments, the synaptic mechanism remains unclear. By using whole-cell patch clamp recording, we found that decreased neuronal excitability and alterations in intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 PNs in Opcml-deficient mice. Furthermore, Opcml deficiency leads to impaired glutamatergic transmission in hippocampus, which is closely related to postsynaptic AMPA/NMDA receptors dysfunction, resulting in the disturbances of E/I balance. Additionally, we found that the aripiprazole which we used to ameliorate abnormal cognitive behaviors also rescued the impaired glutamatergic transmission in Opcml-deficient mice.

        "abstract": "For several decades, the dopamine hypothesis contributed to the discovery of numerous typical and atypical antipsychotics and was the sole hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, neither typical nor atypical antipsychotics, other than clozapine, have been effective in addressing negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, which are indices for the prognostic and disability outcomes of schizophrenia. Following the development of atypical antipsychotics, the therapeutic targets for antipsychotics expanded beyond the blockade of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors to explore the partial agonism of the D2 receptor and the modulation of new targets, such as D3, 5-HT1A, 5-HT7, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Despite these efforts, to date, psychiatry has not successfully developed antipsychotics with antipsychotic properties proven to be superior to those of clozapine. The glutamate hypothesis, another hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology/pathomechanism of schizophrenia, was proposed based on clinical findings that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, induce schizophrenia-like psychotic episodes. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) revealed that approximately 30% of the risk genes for schizophrenia (the total number was over one hundred) encode proteins associated with glutamatergic transmission. These findings supported the validation of the glutamate hypothesis, which was inspired by the clinical findings regarding NMDAR antagonists. Additionally, these clinical and genetic findings suggest that schizophrenia is possibly a syndrome with complicated pathomechanisms that are affected by multiple biological and genetic vulnerabilities. The glutamate hypothesis has been the most extensively investigated pathophysiology/pathomechanism hypothesis, other than the dopamine hypothesis. Studies have revealed the possibility that functional abnormalities of the NMDAR play important roles in the pathophysiology/pathomechanism of schizophrenia. However, no antipsychotics derived from the glutamatergic hypothesis have yet been approved for the treatment of schizophrenia or treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Considering the increasing evidence supporting the potential pro-cognitive effects of glutamatergic agents and the lack of sufficient medications to treat the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia, these previous setbacks cannot preclude research into potential novel glutamate modulators. Given this background, to emphasize the importance of the dysfunction of the NMDAR in the pathomechanism and/or pathophysiology of schizophrenia, this review introduces the increasing findings on the functional abnormalities in glutamatergic transmission associated with the NMDAR.",

Also, understanding the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in schizophrenia pathogenesis can pave the way for developing novel treatments for patients with schizophrenia.

A nervous-system-specific Zfp804a (ZNF804A murine gene) conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 technology and the Cre/loxP method. Multiple and complex SCZ-like behaviors, such as anxiety, depression, and impaired cognition, were observed in Zfp804a cKO mice. Molecular biological methods and targeted metabolomics assay validated that Zfp804a cKO mice displayed altered SATB2 (a cortical superficial neuron marker) expression in the cortex; aberrant NeuN, cleaved caspase 3, and DLG4 (markers of mature neurons, apoptosis, and postsynapse, respectively) expressions in the hippocampus and a loss of glutamate (Glu)/\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) homeostasis with abnormal GAD67 (Gad1) expression in the hippocampus.

        "abstract": "For nearly fifty years, the dopamine hypothesis has dominated our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and provided the lone target for drug development. However, with the exception of clozapine, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonizing anti-psychotic drugs have little impact on the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, aspects of the disorder that robustly predict outcome. Pathologic studies reveal cortical atrophy and wide-spread loss of glutamatergic synaptic spines, unexplained by dopaminergic malfunction. Recent genome-wide association studies indicate that at least thirty risk genes for schizophrenia encode proteins localized to the glutamatergic synapse and inhibit glutamate neurotransmission, especially at the NMDA receptor. To function, the NMDA receptor requires the binding of glycine (primarily in the cerebellum and brainstem) or D-serine (in forebrain) to the NR1 channel subunit of the NMDA receptor. Genetically silencing the gene (srr) encoding serine racemase, the biosynthetic enzyme for D-serine, results in forebrain NMDA receptor hypofunction. The srr-/- mice have 90\u00a0% loss of endogenous D-serine and approximately 70\u00a0% decrease in NMDA receptor function. Several animal models of schizophrenia are based on behavioral and pharmacologic strategies, which have negligible validity with regard to the fundamental etiology of schizophrenia. We summarize here the results of a mouse model, in which srr, one of the two dozen or more risk gene for schizophrenia that affect NMDA receptor function, has been inactivated. The srr-/- mice exhibit striking similarities to schizophrenia including cortical atrophy, loss of cortico-limbic glutamatergic synapses, increased sub-cortical dopamine release, EEG abnormalities, and cognitive impairments. The limited efficacy of drugs targeting the glutamatergic synapse on DSM-5 diagnosed criteria for schizophrenia used in clinical trials may reflect the fact that only 30\u00a0% of the patients have impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission, resulting from the genetic heterogeneity of the disorder.",

Assessments at baseline: MATRICS\u00a0Consensus Cognitive Battery; N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor co-agonists biomarkers in brain by MRS (prefrontal glutamate levels) and plasma (D-serine and glutamate pathways key markers). Patients were compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009114). Results: patient mean age 23, 27%\u00a0female. Treatment-resistant (n\u2009=\u200951) showed lower scores than responders (n\u2009=\u2009183) in processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning and visual learning. Limited responders (n\u2009=\u200959) displayed an intermediary phenotype. Treatment-resistant and limited responders were merged in one group for the subsequent D-serine and glutamate pathway analyses. This group showed D-serine pathway dysregulation, with lower levels of the enzymes serine\u00a0racemase and serine-hydroxymethyltransferase\u00a01, and higher levels of the glutamate-cysteine\u00a0transporter\u00a03 than in responders. Better cognition was associated with higher D-serine and lower glutamate-cysteine\u00a0transporter\u00a03 levels only in responders; this association was disrupted in the treatment\u00a0resistant group. Treatment\u00a0resistant\u00a0patients and limited\u00a0responders displayed early cognitive and persistent functioning impairment. The dysregulation of NMDAR co-agonist pathways provides underlying molecular mechanisms for cognitive deficits in treatment-resistant first-episode psychosis. If replicated, our findings would open ways to mechanistic biomarkers guiding response-based patient stratification and targeting cognitive improvement in clinical trials.",

        "title": "Dysregulated Transcript Expression but Not Function of the Glutamate Transporter EAAT2 in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Schizophrenia.",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a serious mental illness with complex pathology, including abnormalities in the glutamate system. Glutamate is rapidly removed from the synapse by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Changes in the expression and localization of the primary glutamate transporter EAAT2 are found in the brain in central nervous system (CNS) disorders including SCZ. We hypothesize that neuronal expression and function of EAAT2 are increased in the frontal cortex in subjects diagnosed with SCZ. EAAT2 protein expression and glutamate transporter function were assayed in synaptosome preparations from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ subjects and age- and sex-matched nonpsychiatrically ill controls. EAAT2 splice variant transcript expression was assayed in enriched populations of neurons and astrocytes from the DLPFC. Pathway analysis of publicly available transcriptomic datasets was carried out to identify biological changes associated with EAAT2 perturbation in different cell types. We found no significant changes in EAAT2 protein expression or glutamate uptake in the DLPFC in SCZ subjects compared with controls (n\u2005=\u200510/group). Transcript expression of EAAT2 and signaling molecules associated with EAAT2b trafficking (CaMKIIa and DLG1) were significantly altered in enriched populations of astrocytes and pyramidal neurons (P\u2005<\u2005.05) in SCZ (n\u2005=\u200516/group). These changes were not associated with antipsychotic medications. Pathway analysis also identified cell-type-specific enrichment of biological pathways associated with perturbation of astrocyte (immune pathways) and neuronal (metabolic pathways) EAAT2 expression. Overall, these data support the growing body of evidence for the role of dysregulation of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of SCZ.",

        "abstract": "Studies using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal substantial inconsistencies in the levels of brain glutamate, glutamine and glutamate + glutamine across schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This systematic review employs qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse the patterns and relationships between glutamatergic metabolites, schizophrenia spectrum disorders and brain regions. A literature search was conducted using various databases with keywords including glutamate, glutamine, schizophrenia, psychosis and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Inclusion criteria were limited to case-control studies that reported glutamatergic metabolite levels in adult patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis - i.e. first-episode psychosis, schizophrenia, treatment-resistant schizophrenia and/or ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia - using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T or above. Pooled study data were synthesized and analysed. A total of 92 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 2721 healthy controls and 2822 schizophrenia spectrum disorder participants. Glu levels were higher in the basal ganglia, frontal cortex and medial prefrontal of first-episode psychosis participants, contrasting overall lower levels in schizophrenia participants. For Gln, strong differences in metabolite levels were evident in the basal ganglia, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal cortex, with first-episode psychosis showing significantly higher levels in the basal ganglia. In glutamate + glutamine, higher metabolite levels were found across schizophrenia spectrum disorder groups, particularly in the basal ganglia and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of treatment-resistant schizophrenia participants. Significant relationships were found between metabolite levels and medication status, clinical measures and methodological variables. The review highlights abnormal glutamatergic metabolite levels throughout schizophrenia spectrum disorders and in specific brain regions. The review underscores the importance of standardized future research assessing glutamatergic metabolites using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy due to considerable literature heterogeneity.",

        "title": "Multiple serum anti-glutamate receptor antibody levels in clozapine-treated/na\u00efve patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",
        "abstract": "Glutamatergic function abnormalities have been implicated in the etiology of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), and the efficacy of clozapine may be attributed to its impact on the glutamate system. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting the involvement of immune processes and increased prevalence of antineuronal antibodies in TRS. This current study aimed to investigate the levels of multiple anti-glutamate receptor antibodies in TRS and explore the effects of clozapine on these antibody levels. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure and compare the levels of anti-glutamate receptor antibodies (NMDAR, AMPAR, mGlur3, mGluR5) in clozapine-treated TRS patients (TRS-C, n\u2009=\u200937), clozapine-na\u00efve TRS patients (TRS-NC, n\u2009=\u200939), and non-TRS patients (nTRS, n\u2009=\u200935). Clinical symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), while cognitive function was evaluated using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The levels of all four glutamate receptor antibodies in TRS-NC were significantly higher than those in nTRS (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and in TRS-C (p\u00a0<\u20090.001), and the antibody levels in TRS-C were comparable to those in nTRS. However, no significant associations were observed between antibody levels and symptom severity or cognitive function across all three groups after FDR correction. Our findings suggest that TRS may related to increased anti-glutamate receptor antibody levels and provide further evidence that glutamatergic dysfunction and immune processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of TRS. The impact of clozapine on anti-glutamate receptor antibody levels may be a pharmacological mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects.",

        "title": "Association of neurotransmitter pathway polygenic risk with specific symptom profiles in psychosis.",
        "abstract": "A primary goal of psychiatry is to better understand the pathways that link genetic risk to psychiatric symptoms. Here, we tested association of diagnosis and endophenotypes with overall and neurotransmitter pathway-specific polygenic risk in patients with early-stage psychosis. Subjects included 205 demographically diverse cases with a psychotic disorder who underwent comprehensive psychiatric and neurological phenotyping and 115 matched controls. Following genotyping, we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS summary statistics. To test if overall genetic risk can be partitioned into affected neurotransmitter pathways, we calculated pathway PGSs (pPGSs) for SZ risk affecting each of four major neurotransmitter systems: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Psychosis subjects had elevated SZ PGS versus controls; cases with SZ or BP diagnoses had stronger SZ or BP risk, respectively. There was no significant association within psychosis cases between individual symptom measures and overall PGS. However, neurotransmitter-specific pPGSs were moderately associated with specific endophenotypes; notably, glutamate was associated with SZ diagnosis and with deficits in cognitive control during task-based fMRI, while dopamine was associated with global functioning. Finally, unbiased endophenotype-driven clustering identified three diagnostically mixed case groups that separated on primary deficits of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognitive control. All clusters showed strong genome-wide risk. Cluster 2, characterized by deficits in cognitive control and negative symptoms, additionally showed specific risk concentrated in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Due to the intensive characterization of our subjects, the present study was limited to a relatively small cohort. As such, results should be followed up with additional research at the population and mechanism level. Our study suggests pathway-based PGS analysis may be a powerful path forward to study genetic mechanisms driving psychiatric endophenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Given its polygenic nature, there is a need for a personalized approach to schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to select laboratory biomarkers from blood, brain imaging, and clinical assessment, with an emphasis on patients' self-report questionnaires. Metabolomics studies of serum samples from 51 patients and 45 healthy volunteers, based on the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), led to the identification of 3 biochemical indicators (cortisol, glutamate, lactate) of schizophrenia. These metabolites were sequentially correlated with laboratory tests results, imaging results, and clinical assessment outcomes, including patient self-report outcomes. The hierarchical cluster analysis on the principal components (HCPC) was performed to identify the most homogeneous clinical groups. Significant correlations were noted between blood lactates and 11 clinical and 10 neuroimaging parameters. The increase in lactate and cortisol were significantly associated with a decrease in immunological parameters, especially with the level of reactive lymphocytes. The strongest correlations with the level of blood lactate and cortisol were demonstrated by brain glutamate, N-acetylaspartate and the concentrations of glutamate and glutamine, creatine and phosphocreatine in the prefrontal cortex. Metabolomics studies and the search for associations with brain parameters and self-reported outcomes may provide new diagnostic evidence to specific schizophrenia phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and neurotransmitter systems might mediate the risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Consequently, we investigated in patients with SSD and healthy controls (HC) the relations between (1) plasma concentrations of two prototypical endocannabinoids (N-arachidonoylethanolamine [anandamide] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) and (2) striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), and glutamate and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As anandamide and 2-AG might reduce the activity of these neurotransmitters, we hypothesized negative correlations between their plasma levels and the abovementioned neurotransmitters in both groups. Blood samples were obtained from 18 patients and 16 HC to measure anandamide and 2-AG plasma concentrations. For all subjects, we acquired proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans to assess Glx (i.e. glutamate plus glutamine) and GABA + (i.e. GABA plus macromolecules) concentrations in the ACC. Ten patients and 14 HC also underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DOPA positron emission tomography for assessment of striatal DSC. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relations between the outcome measures. A negative association between 2-AG plasma concentration and ACC Glx concentration was found in patients (<i>p</i> = 0.008). We found no evidence of other significant relationships between 2-AG or anandamide plasma concentrations and dopaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic measures in either group. Our preliminary results suggest an association between peripheral 2-AG and ACC Glx levels in patients.",

        "abstract": "The histamine-3 receptor (H3R) may have a role in cognitive processes through its action as a presynaptic heteroreceptor inhibiting the release of glutamate in the brain. To explore this, we examined anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum H3R availability in patients with schizophrenia and characterized their relationships with glutamate levels in corresponding brain regions. We employed a cross-sectional study, recruiting 12 patients with schizophrenia and 12 healthy volunteers. Participants underwent positron emission tomography using the H3R-specific radio ligand [11C]MK-8278, followed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutamate levels, recorded as Glu and Glx. Based on existing literature, the ACC and striatum were selected as regions of interest. We found significant inverse relationships between tracer uptake and Glu (r\u2009=\u2009-0.66, P\u2009=\u2009.02) and Glx (r\u2009=\u2009-0.62, P\u2009=\u2009.04) levels in the ACC of patients, which were absent in healthy volunteers (Glu: r\u2009=\u2009-0.19, P\u2009=\u2009.56, Glx: r\u2009=\u20090.10, P\u2009=\u2009.75). We also found a significant difference in striatal (F1,20\u2009=\u20096.00, P\u2009=\u2009.02) and ACC (F1,19\u2009=\u20094.75, P\u2009=\u2009.04) Glx levels between groups. These results provide evidence of a regionally specific relationship between H3Rs and glutamate levels, which builds on existing preclinical literature. Our findings add to a growing literature indicating H3Rs may be a promising treatment target in schizophrenia, particularly for cognitive impairment, which has been associated with altered glutamate signaling.",
