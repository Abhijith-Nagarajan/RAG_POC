        "title": "Glutamate plus glutamine to GABA ratio as a predictor of ketamine response in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, randomized, open-label extension study.",
        "abstract": "Approximately 30\u00a0% of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (\u00b1SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) with no such association in the placebo group. These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD.",

Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13)\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.66, p\u2009=\u20090.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",

Using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), this study aimed to determine whether lower pretreatment GABA and Glx levels in the medial frontal cortex, a region implicated in MDD pathophysiology, are associated with better antidepressant treatment response. Participants with MDD (N\u2009=\u200974) were antidepressant na\u00efve or medication-free for at least three weeks before imaging. Two MEGA-PRESS <sup>1</sup>H-MRS acquisitions were collected, interleaved with a water unsuppressed reference scan. GABA and Glx concentrations were quantified from an average difference spectrum, with preprocessing using Gannet and spectral fitting using TARQUIN. Following imaging, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied with treatment type and age as covariates. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing was used to interpret the strength of the evidence. No significant association was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA, or Glx/GABA and depression remission status or the continuous outcome, percent change in symptom severity. In an exploratory analysis, no significant correlation was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA or Glx/GABA and days to response. Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence towards the null hypotheses in all cases. To date, there are no replicated biomarkers in psychiatry. To address this, well-powered, placebo-controlled trials need to be undertaken and reported. The present analysis suggests pretreatment GABA, Glx, or their ratio cannot predict antidepressant treatment response.

        "abstract": "Glutamatergic dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, few physiological studies have evaluated its pathophysiology in vivo in individuals with TRD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) techniques can assess intracortical facilitation (ICF), which reflects glutamatergic neurophysiological function in specific cortical regions. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare glutamatergic receptor-mediated function as indexed with ICF TMS-EEG in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) between participants with TRD and healthy controls (HCs) and (2) to explore the relationships between cell-specific gene expression levels and the group difference in glutamatergic neural propagation using virtual histology approach. Sixty participants with TRD and thirty HCs were examined with ICF TMS-EEG measure (80 single-pulse TMS and paired-pulse ICF) in the left DLPFC. Both sensor and source-level ICF measures were computed to compare them between the TRD and HC groups. Furthermore, we conducted spatial correlation analyses interregionally between ICF glutamatergic activity and cell-specific gene expression levels employing the Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset. DLPFC-ICF at the sensor level was not significantly different between the two groups, whereas DLPFC-ICF at the source level was reduced in the TRD group compared with the HC group (p\u2009=\u20090.026). Moreover, the reduced ICF signal propagation of TRD correlated with astrocyte-specific gene expression level (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The glutamatergic neural activities indexed by ICF in the left DLPFC were decreased in participants with TRD. Additionally, a relative reduction in glutamatergic signal propagation originating from the DLPFC in TRD may be associated with astrocytic abnormality.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial antioxidant in the human brain. Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy sequence is highly recommended, limited literature has measured cortical GSH using this method in major psychiatric disorders. By combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we quantified brain GSH and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus and explored relationships between GSH levels and intrinsic neuronal activity as well as clinical symptoms among healthy control (HC) participants (n\u00a0= 30), people with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n\u00a0= 28), and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n\u00a0= 28). GSH concentrations were lower in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in both the MDD and OCD groups than in the HC group. In the HC group, positive correlations were noted between GSH and glutamate levels and between GSH and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in both regions. However, while these correlations were absent in both patient groups, there was a weak positive correlation between glutamate and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Moreover, GSH levels were negatively correlated with depressive and compulsive symptoms in MDD and OCD, respectively. These findings suggest that reduced GSH levels and an imbalance between GSH and glutamate could increase oxidative stress and alter neurotransmitter signaling, thereby leading to disruptions in GSH-related neurochemical-neuronal coupling and psychopathologies across MDD and OCD. Understanding these mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the processes that underlie these disorders and potentially become a springboard for future directions and advancing our knowledge of their neurobiological foundations.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a form of glial cell-based synaptic dysfunction disease in which glial cells interact closely with neuronal synapses and perform synaptic information processing. Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, are active components of the brain and are responsible for synaptic activity through the release gliotransmitters. A reduced density of astrocytes and astrocyte dysfunction have both been identified the brains of patients with MDD. Furthermore, gliotransmission, i.e., active information transfer mediated by gliotransmitters between astrocytes and neurons, is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. However, the mechanism by which astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission contributes to depression remains unknown. This review therefore summarizes the alterations in astrocytes in MDD, including astrocyte marker, connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, Cx43 gap junctions, and Cx43 hemichannels, and describes the regulatory mechanisms of astrocytes involved in synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms acting of the glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and purinergic systems that modulate synaptic function and the antidepressant mechanisms of the related receptor antagonists. Further, we summarize the roles of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, d-serine, and adenosine triphosphate in depression, providing a basis for the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for MDD.",

MDD is especially burdensome as approved monoamine antidepressant treatments have weeks-long delays before clinical benefit and low remission rates. In the past 2\u00a0decades, a promising target emerged to improve patient outcomes in depression treatment: glutamatergic signaling. This narrative review provides a high-level overview of glutamate signaling in synaptogenesis and neural plasticity and the implications of glutamate dysregulation in depression. Based on this preclinical evidence implicating glutamate in depression and the rapid improvement of depression with ketamine treatment in a proof-of-concept trial, a range of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-targeted therapies have been investigated. While an array of treatments has been investigated in registered phase 2 or 3 clinical trials, the development of most of these agents has been discontinued. Multiple glutamate-targeted antidepressants are actively in development, and two are approved. Nasal administration of esketamine (Spravato<sup>\u00ae</sup>) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression and in 2020 for adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. Oral combination dextromethorphan-bupropion (AXS-05, Auvelity<sup>\u00ae</sup> extended-release tablet) was FDA approved in 2022 for the treatment of MDD in adults. These approvals bolster the importance of glutamate in depression and represent an exciting breakthrough in contemporary psychiatry, providing new avenues of treatment for patients as first-line therapy or with either poor response or unacceptable side effects to monoaminergic antidepressants.",

In addition, all participants with PTSD and/or MDD collectively demonstrated decreased glutathione relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls. Despite limited findings in single metabolites, patterns of abnormality in prefrontal metabolite concentrations among individuals with PTSD and/or MDD enabled supervised classification to separate them from healthy controls with 80+% sensitivity and specificity, with glutathione, glutamine, and myoinositol consistently among the most informative metabolites for this classification.

However, only 30-45% of patients respond to rTMS. Predicting response to rTMS will benefit both patients and providers in terms of prescribing and targeting treatment for maximum efficacy and directing resources, as individuals with lower likelihood of response could be redirected to more suitable treatment alternatives. In this exploratory study, our goal was to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine how glutamate (Glu), Glx, and total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) predict post-rTMS changes in overall MDD severity and symptoms, and treatment response. Metabolites were measured in a right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex voxel prior to a standard course of 10\u2009Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC in 25 individuals with MDD. MDD severity and symptoms were evaluated via the Inventory of Depression Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR). rTMS response was defined as \u226550% change in full-scale IDS-SR scores post treatment. Percent change in IDS-SR symptom domains were evaluated using principal component analysis and established subscales. Generalized linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between baseline Glu, Glx, and tNAA and outcomes while controlling for age and sex. Participants with baseline Glu and Glx levels in the lower range had greater percent change in full scale IDS-SR scores post-treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001), as did tNAA (p\u2009=\u20090.007).

This lag represents a significant problem in the currently available treatments for serious depression. Ketamine, acting as an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, was shown to have rapid antidepressant-like effects, marking a significant advancement in the study of mood disorders. However, serious side effects and adverse reactions limit its clinical use. Considering the limitations of ketamine, it is crucial to further define the network targets of ketamine. The rapid action of ketamine an as antidepressant is thought to be mediated by the glutamate system. It is believed that synaptic plasticity is essential for the rapid effects of ketamine as an antidepressant. Other mechanisms include the involvement of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic), 5-HTergic systems, and recent studies have linked astrocytes to ketamine's rapid antidepressant-like effects.

Arguments regarding its cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant activity mainly come from animal studies.

Cognitive deficits (including inattention, poor memory, and decision-making difficulties) are common in the clinical picture of depression. Cognitive impairment has been hypothesized to be one of the most important components of major depressive disorder (MDD; referred to as clinical depression), although typical cognitive symptoms are less frequent in people with depression than in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD; sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder). The importance of \u03b1-Klotho in the aging process has been well-documented. Growing evidence points to the role of \u03b1-Klotho in regulating other biological functions, including responses to oxidative stress and the modulation of synaptic plasticity.

Notably, the occurrence of suicide frequently coincides with depressive episodes. Suicide is as a paramount global health concern that demands efficacious preventive strategies. Current psychiatric approaches heavily rely on pharmacological interventions but have had limited success in addressing the global burden of mental health issues. Suboptimal nutrition, with its impact on the neuroendocrine system, has been implicated in the underlying pathology of depressive disorders. Folate, a group of water-soluble compounds, plays a crucial role in various central nervous system functions. Depressed individuals often exhibit low levels of serum and red blood cell folate. Multiple studies and systematic reviews have investigated the efficacy of folic acid and its derivative, L-methylfolate, which can cross the blood-brain barrier, as stand-alone or adjunct therapies for depression. Although findings have been mixed, the available evidence generally supports the use of these compounds in depressed individuals. Recent studies have established links between the one-carbon cycle, folate-homocysteine balance, immune system function, glutamate excitation via NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and gut microbiome eubiosis in mood regulation. These findings provide insights into the complex neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of folate and related compounds in depression. Through a comprehensive review of the existing literature, this study aims to advance our understanding of the therapeutic potential of folic acid and related compounds in depression treatment. It also seeks to explore their role in addressing suicidal tendencies and shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms involved, leveraging the latest discoveries in depression research.",

        "title": "Brain-wide changes in excitation-inhibition balance of major depressive disorder: a systematic review of topographic patterns of GABA- and glutamatergic alterations.",
        "abstract": "The excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is an important molecular pathological feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) as altered GABA and glutamate levels have been found in multiple brain regions in patients. Healthy subjects show topographic organization of the E/I balance (EIB) across various brain regions. We here raise the question of whether such EIB topography is altered in MDD. Therefore, we systematically review the gene and protein expressions of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic signaling-related molecules in postmortem MDD brain studies as proxies for EIB topography. Searches were conducted through PubMed and 45 research articles were finally included. We found: i) brain-wide GABA- and glutamatergic alterations; ii) attenuated GABAergic with enhanced glutamatergic signaling in the cortical-subcortical limbic system; iii) that GABAergic signaling is decreased in regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) while it is increased in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). These together demonstrate abnormal GABA- and glutamatergic signaling-based EIB topographies in MDD. This enhances our pathophysiological understanding of MDD and carries important therapeutic implications for stimulation treatment.",

        "title": "Effects of Psychotherapy on Glutamatergic Neurotransmission.",
        "abstract": "Psychodynamic psychotherapy is an effective and widely used treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD); however, little is known about neurobiological changes associated with induced symptom improvement. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with a two-dimensional J-resolved sequence served to test the relationship between glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) levels, measured separately in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) as a control region, with change in depression symptoms after 6 months of weekly psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions in MDD patients. Depressed (N = 45) and healthy (N = 30) subjects participated in a baseline proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement and a subgroup of MDD subjects (N = 21) then received once-a-week psychodynamic psychotherapy and participated in a second proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement after 6 months. Change in depression symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Higher pretreatment pgACC Gln concentrations in MDD patients compared to healthy controls were associated with symptom severity. Patients and controls did not differ regarding Gln levels in aMCC nor regarding Glu levels in both regions. The association of pgACC Gln concentration and severity of depressive symptoms was reversed after 6 months of psychotherapy in MDD subjects. Regarding Gln in aMCC as well as Glu in both regions, there were no significant associations with improvement of depressive symptoms in the course of psychotherapy. Findings indicate specific regional effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy on glutamatergic neurotransmission and thereby highlight the key role of the pgACC in both depression pathophysiology and recovery.",

        "title": "Brain metabolic derangements examined using <sup>1</sup>H MRS and their (in)consistency among different rodent models of depression.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is underlined by neurochemical changes in the brain. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS) is a useful tool for their examination as it provides information about the levels of metabolites. This review summarises the current knowledge of <sup>1</sup>H MRS findings from rodent models of MDD, assesses the results from both a biological and a technical perspective, and identifies the main sources of bias. From a technical point of view, bias-introducing factors are the diversity of the measured volumes and their positioning in the brain, the data processing, and the metabolite concentration expression. The biological variables are strain, sex, and species, as well as the model itself, and in vivo vs. ex vivo exploration. This review identified some consistency in the <sup>1</sup>H MRS findings in the models of MDD: lower levels of glutamine, glutamate + glutamine, and higher levels of myo-inositol and taurine in most of the brain regions of MDD models. This may suggest changes in regional metabolism, neuronal dysregulation, inflammation, and a compensatory effect reaction in the MDD rodent models.",

        "title": "Intrahippocampal injection of a selective blocker of NMDA receptors containing the GluN2B subunit, Ro25-6981, increases glutamate neurotransmission and induces antidepressant-like effects.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious public health problem, as it is the most common psychiatric disorder worldwide. Antidepressant drugs increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is required to induce some behavioral effects of antidepressants. Adult-born granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and the glutamate receptors subunits 2 (GluN2B) subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ionotropic receptors play an important role in these effects. However, the precise neurochemical role of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor on adult-born GCs for antidepressant-like effects has yet to be elucidated. The present study aims to explore the contribution of the GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) to the antidepressant drug treatment using a pharmacological approach. Thus, (\u03b1R)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-(\u03b2S)-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol (Ro25-6981), a selective antagonist of the GluN2B subunit, was acutely administered locally into the ventral DG (vDG, 1\u2009\u03bcg each side) following a chronic fluoxetine (18\u2009mg/kg/day) treatment-known to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis-in a mouse model of anxiety/depression. Responses in a neurogenesis-dependent task, the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), and neurochemical consequences on extracellular glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the vDG were measured. Here, we show a rapid-acting antidepressant-like effect of local Ro25-6981 administration in the NSF independent of fluoxetine treatment. Furthermore, we revealed a fluoxetine-independent increase in the glutamatergic transmission in the vDG. Our results suggest behavioral and neurochemical effects of GluN2B subunit independent of serotonin reuptake inhibition.",

        "title": "Understanding Lamotrigine's Role in the CNS and Possible Future Evolution.",
        "abstract": "The anti-epileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) has been widely used to treat various neurological disorders, including epilepsy and bipolar disorder. However, its precise mechanism of action in the central nervous system (CNS) still needs to be determined. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of LTG in modulating the activity of voltage-gated ion channels, particularly those related to the inhibition of neuronal excitability. Additionally, LTG has been found to have neuroprotective effects, potentially through the inhibition of glutamate release and the enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. LTG's unique mechanism of action compared to other anti-epileptic drugs has led to the investigation of its use in treating other CNS disorders, such as neuropathic pain, PTSD, and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, the drug has been combined with other anti-epileptic drugs and mood stabilizers, which may enhance its therapeutic effects. In conclusion, LTG's potential to modulate multiple neurotransmitters and ion channels in the CNS makes it a promising drug for treating various neurological disorders. As our understanding of its mechanism of action in the CNS continues to evolve, the potential for the drug to be used in new indications will also be explored.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder, characterized by aberrant glutamatergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Depression is highly comorbid with metabolic disorders, but a mechanistic link is elusive. In this issue of the JCI, Fan and coauthors report that elevated posttranslational modification with the glucose metabolite N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) contributed to stress-induced establishment of depression-like behaviors in mice. This effect was specific to medial PFC (mPFC) astrocytes, with glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) identified as an OGT target. Specifically, O-GlcNAcylation of GLT-1 resulted in diminished glutamate clearance from excitatory synapses. Further, astrocytic OGT knockdown restored stress-induced deficits in glutamatergic signaling, promoting resilience. These findings provide a mechanistic link between metabolism and depression and have relevance for antidepressant targets.",
