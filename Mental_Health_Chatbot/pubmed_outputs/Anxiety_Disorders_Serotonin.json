        "abstract": "The influence of serotonin function on social phobia has been well-documented, yet the polygenic risk score of serotonergic polymorphisms for social phobia remains unclear. We assessed two aspects of social phobia (i.e., social interaction anxiety and social phobia scrutiny fear) and created a polygenic risk score of seven serotonergic polymorphisms in two independent samples. The results from both samples indicated that a greater polygenic risk score, denoting a higher risk of anxiety, was associated with higher levels of social interaction anxiety and social phobia scrutinizing fear. Interestingly, the association between polygenic risk score and social interaction anxiety was mediated by interpersonal adaptability. These findings demonstrate the importance of serotonergic polymorphisms in social phobia and unveil a psychological pathway whereby interpersonal adaptability mediates the effect of serotonergic polymorphisms on social phobia.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequent and disabling condition, with many patients being treatment-resistant. Improved understanding of its neurobiology is vital for better therapies. Evidence is still conflicting regarding specific serotonergic-related dysfunctions in OCD. We systematically reviewed the literature to provide a quantitative assessment of the role of serotonin (5-HT) in patients with untreated OCD through imaging. We searched for neuroimaging studies investigating central 5-HT tonus in unmedicated patients with OCD, excluding studies comprising treated patients to prevent bias from antidepressant-induced changes in serotonergic tonus. We also conducted a meta-analysis using a homogeneous group of positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography articles that compared 5-HT transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A receptor (HT2AR) binding potential in different brain regions of patients with untreated OCD and healthy controls. The systematic review encompassed 18 articles, with 13 included in the subsequent meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed by a revised form of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We provided standardized mean difference (SMD) values for SERT and 5-HT2AR binding potential measures across 15 different brain regions. Patients with OCD showed lower SERT binding potential in the brainstem (SMD\u2009=\u2009-1.13,\u00a095% CI [-1.81 to -0.46]), midbrain (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.54, 95% CI [-0.92 to -0.16]), and thalamus/hypothalamus regions (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.58, 95% CI [-0.99 to -0.18]) with neglectable to moderate heterogeneity. By combining results from 2 decades of molecular imaging studies, we show that individuals with OCD exhibit lower SERT binding potential in specific brain regions, providing compelling evidence of a 5-HT system dysfunction. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain elusive. The limitations include heterogeneity across studies in populations, imaging techniques, and radiotracer usage.",

        "title": "Unveiling serotonergic dysfunction of obsessive-compulsive disorder on prefrontal network dynamics: a computational perspective.",
        "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",

Here, a well-studied case study of a patient with OCD and MS-compatible diagnostic findings is presented. The 42-year-old female patient had displayed OCD symptoms for 6\u00a0years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses detected an increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, and a positive MRZ reaction. Neopterin was increased, but sarcoidosis was excluded. In the absence of neurological attacks and clues for MRI-based dissemination in time, a radiologically isolated syndrome, the pre-disease stage of MS, was diagnosed. Neurotransmitter measurements of CSF detected reduced serotonin levels. In the absence of visible strategic demyelinating lesions within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes. Serotonin abnormalities in MS should be studied further, as they could potentially explain the association between neuroinflammation and mental illnesses.",

        "abstract": "The presynaptic serotonin transporter (SERT) clears extracellular serotonin following vesicular release to ensure temporal and spatial regulation of serotonergic signalling and neurotransmitter homeostasis. Prescription drugs used to treat neurobehavioral disorders, including depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, trap SERT by blocking the transport cycle. In contrast, illicit drugs of abuse like amphetamines reverse SERT directionality, causing serotonin efflux. Both processes result in increased extracellular serotonin levels. By combining molecular dynamics simulations with biochemical experiments and using a homologous series of serotonin analogues, we uncovered the coupling mechanism between the substrate and the transporter, which triggers the uptake of serotonin. Free energy analysis showed that only scaffold-bound substrates could initiate SERT occlusion through attractive long-range electrostatic interactions acting on the bundle domain. The associated spatial requirements define substrate and inhibitor properties, enabling additional possibilities for rational drug design approaches.",

Buspirone, like many human pharmaceuticals, has been detected in municipal wastewater; however, the environmental exposure risks are unknown for this psychoactive compound. We studied the effects of buspirone on the behavior of zebrafish, focusing on locomotor and anxiolytic behavior. We also measured transcripts associated with oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, and serotonin signaling to identify potential mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes. Concentrations ranged from environmentally relevant (nM) to physiologically active concentrations typical of human pharmaceuticals (\u03bcM). Buspirone treatment did not impact survival, nor did it induce deformities in zebrafish treated for 7\u00a0days up to 10\u00a0\u03bcM. There was a positive relationship between locomotor activity and buspirone concentration in dark periods of the visual motor response test. In the light-dark preference test, both the average time per visit to the dark zone and the percent cumulative duration in the dark zone were increased by 1\u00a0\u03bcM buspirone. Transcript levels of ache, manf, and mbp were decreased in larvae, while the expression of gap43 was increased following exposure to buspirone, indicating potential neurotoxic effects. There was also reduced expression of serotonin-related genes encoding receptors, transporters, and biosynthesis enzymes (i.e., 5ht1aa, sertb, and tph1a).

Disruptions in these control mechanisms are involved in mental disorders such as drug dependence or obsessive-compulsive disorder. While previous reports indicate that lower brain serotonin levels reduce model-based control, it remains unknown whether increases in serotonergic availability might thus increase model-based control. Moreover, the mediating neural mechanisms have not been studied yet. The first aim of this study was to investigate whether increased/decreased tonic serotonin levels affect the arbitration between model-free and model-based control. Second, we aimed to identify the underlying neural processes. We employed a sequential two-stage Markov decision-task and measured brain responses during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 98 participants in a randomized, double-blind cross-over within-subject design. To investigate the influence of serotonin on the balance between model-free and model-based control, we used a tryptophan intervention with three intervention levels (loading, balanced, depletion). We hypothesized that model-based behaviour would increase with higher serotonin levels. We found evidence that neither model-free nor model-based control were affected by changes in tonic serotonin levels. Furthermore, our tryptophan intervention did not elicit relevant changes in Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent activity.",

        "abstract": "The interplay between environmental stress and genetic factors is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the relative contribution of these causative antecedents in the manifestation of cognitive inflexibility-a phenotype often seen in obsessive-compulsive (OC)- spectrum disorders-is not fully understood. In this study, we treated mice with 50\u00a0mg/L corticosterone (CORT, a glucocorticoid stress hormone) in their drinking water during adolescence. In adulthood, we assessed anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity; along with operant-based discrimination and reversal learning. RU-24969, a selective serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonist, was used as an acute pharmacological model of OC-like behaviour. RU-24969 (5\u00a0mg/kg) was administered prior to each reversal learning testing session. We found that acute treatment with 5\u00a0mg/kg RU-24969 induced stereotyped hyperlocomotion in vehicle- and CORT-treated mice. Furthermore, pre-treatment with CORT in adolescence produced subtle anxiety-like behaviour in adult mice, and also resulted in an impairment to late-stage discrimination learning and alterations to reversal learning. Finally, acute treatment with 5\u00a0mg/kg RU-24969 caused an impairment to early-stage reversal learning. Whilst we revealed dissociable detrimental effects of adolescent CORT treatment and acute 5-HT<sub>1A/1B</sub> receptor agonism on discrimination and reversal learning, respectively, we did not find evidence of additive deleterious effects of these two treatments. We therefore suggest that while disrupted serotonergic signalling is likely to be involved in the cognitive phenotype of OC-spectrum disorders, distinct neuropathological pathways may be at play in mediating the role of stress as an antecedent in OCD and related illnesses.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common mental disorder, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the cornerstone of its pharmacological treatment. About 40-60% of the cases are treatment-refractory, and this makes searching for second-line treatment necessary. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonists are among the many medications that have been used in augmentation with SSRIs. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in augmentation with SSRIs in treating moderate to severe OCD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar for relevant trials published up to December 2022. The effect size was the mean difference in Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) scores before and after receiving 5-HT3 receptor antagonist drugs in augmentation with SSRIs in moderate to severe OCD patients. We included 6 randomized-controlled trails (RCTs) with 334 patients assessing the effect of the augmentation of SSRIs with ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron on treating moderate to severe OCD. Our results were in favor of the experimental group in total (Z\u2009=\u20098.37, P\u2009<\u20090.00001), in the compulsion subgroup (Z\u2009=\u20095.22, P\u2009<\u20090.00001), and in the obsession subgroup (Z\u2009=\u20098.33, P\u2009<\u20090.00001). They are well-tolerated, and have mild side effects and do not result in withdrawal. Augmentation of 5-HT3 antagonists with SSRIs can be beneficial in treating moderate to severe OCD.

Ashwagandha, an ayurvedic adaptogen has been traditionally used to manage stress, anxiety, and general well-being. We assessed the effect of Ashwagandha root extract (ARE-500\u2009mg) standardized for 2.5% withanolides as per USP protocol with piperine (5\u2009mg of 95% piperine) once daily for 60 days (12.5\u2009mg withanolides/day) to alleviate stress and anxiety in healthy individuals with mild to moderate symptoms. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted for 60 days using ARE (n\u2005=\u200527) and placebo (n\u2005=\u200527) once daily at night at Narayana Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Bangalore, and Vijaya Super Specialty Hospital, Nellore, in India.

Safety was evaluated by laboratory parameters, and by monitoring any incidence of adverse events. 54 individuals were randomized and 50 of them completed the study. The PSS, GAD-7, and QOL scores improved significantly in all the participants taking ARE compared to the placebo. The CANTAB analysis revealed a significant improvement in multitasking, concentration, and decision taking time in ARE compared to placebo. ARE was also associated with a greater reduction in the morning salivary cortisol and an increase in urinary serotonin compared to placebo. Serum levels of NO, GSH, and MDA were not significantly different. Biochemical and hematological parameters remained in the normal range in all participants and ARE was well tolerated during the study. The results of the study suggest that ARE with 2.5% withanolides can effectively improve stress and anxiety by reducing cortisol and increasing serotonin in healthy individuals with mild to moderate symptoms.",

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line therapy for OCD but their neurobiological effects on the brain is only partially understood. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight structural and functional brain imaging modifications induced by SSRIs treatment. A literature search on PubMed, Psych-Info and Embase database was performed. Studies including patients with OCD that analyzed the effect of SSRIs through structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging were selected. Seven relevant studies were considered eligible for the present review. Overall, the results of the reviewed studies showed that SSRIs treatment seems to normalize structural, in terms of the white matter and gray matter volumes, and functional activity alterations observed in OCD patients, especially in regions within the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The poor design of the studies, the small and heterogeneous samples, differences in age, gender, illness course, comorbidities, treatment protocols and the different magnetic fields used make it difficult to generalize the results. From the available evidence it emerged that SSRIs treatment has proven to be effective in normalizing brain structural and functional alterations observed in OCD patients. However, future neuroimaging investigations should focus on long-term effects of drugs on brain structure and function in OCD patients through longitudinal approaches in order to identify more effective treatments for these patients.",

We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another.

However, the receptor mechanisms implicated in the putative anti-obsessional effect are not clear. On this background, we set out to explore (1) the role of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying; (2) the effect of staggered versus bolus psilocybin administration and persistence of the effect; (3) the effect of the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone, on marble-burying and the head twitch response (HTR) induced by psilocybin, a rodent correlate of psychedelic effects. Male ICR mice were administered psilocybin 4.4\u2009mg/kg, escitalopram 5\u2009mg/kg, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) 2\u2009mg/kg, M100907 2\u2009mg/kg, buspirone 5\u2009mg/kg, WAY100635 2\u2009mg/kg or combinations, intraperitoneally, and were tested on the marble burying test. HTR was examined in a magnetometer-based assay. The results show that (1) Psilocybin and escitalopram significantly reduced marble burying. The effect of psilocybin was not attenuated by the 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907. The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, reduced marble burying as did the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was additive to that of psilocybin, but that of buspirone was not. The 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone but not the effect of psilocybin. (2) Psilocybin injections over 3.5\u2009h had no effect on marble burying and the effect of bolus injection was not persistent. (3) Co-administration of buspirone with psilocybin blocked its effect on HTR. These data suggest that neither 5-HT2A nor 5-HT1A receptors are pivotally implicated in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying. Co-administration with buspirone may block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin without impeding its anti-obsessional effects.",

Our extensive review failed to find a link between VD deficiency, depression, and anxiety-related behavior in preclinical animal models. However, strong evidence suggests that VD supplementation may alleviate symptoms in chronically stressed rodents, with some promising evidence from clinical studies. Further, fecal microbiota transplantations suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It has been postulated that serotonin, primarily produced by gut bacteria, may be a crucial factor. Hence, whether VD has the ability to impact gut microbiota and modulate serotonin synthesis warrants further investigation. Taken together, literature has suggested that VD may serve as a key regulator in the gut-brain axis to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inconsistent results of VD supplementation in clinical studies, particularly among VD deficient participants, suggests that current intake recommendations may need to be re-evaluated for individuals at-risk (i.e. prior to diagnosis) of developing depression and/or anxiety.",

        "title": "Chemical Modulators for Targeting Autism Spectrum Disorders: From Bench to Clinic.",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by diverse behavioral symptoms such as repetitive behaviors, social deficits, anxiety, hyperactivity, and irritability. Despite their increasing incidence, the specific pathological mechanisms of ASD are still unknown, and the degree and types of symptoms that vary from patient to patient make it difficult to develop drugs that target the core symptoms of ASD. Although various atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants have been applied to regulate ASD symptoms, these drugs can only alleviate the symptoms and do not target the major causes. Therefore, development of novel drugs targeting factors directly related to the onset of ASD is required. Among the various factors related to the onset of ASD, several chemical modulators to treat ASD, focused on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and glutamate receptors, microbial metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines, are explored in this study. In particular, we focus on the chemical drugs that have improved various aspects of ASD symptoms in animal models and in clinical trials for various ages of patients with ASD.",

        "title": "Concurrent anxiety in patients with major depression and cerebral serotonin 4 receptor binding. A NeuroPharm-1 study.",
        "abstract": "Concurrent anxiety is frequent in major depressive disorder and a shared pathophysiological mechanism between anxiety and other depressive symptoms is plausible. The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT<sub>4</sub>R) has been implicated in both depression and anxiety. This is the first study to investigate the association between the cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding and anxiety in patients with depression before and after antidepressant treatment and the association to treatment response. Ninety-one drug-free patients with depression were positron emission tomography scanned with the 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]-SB207145. Depression severity and concurrent anxiety was measured at baseline and throughout 8\u2009weeks of antidepressant treatment. Anxiety measures included four domains: anxiety/somatization factor score; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 10-items (GAD-10) score; anxiety/somatization factor score \u22657 (anxious depression) and syndromal anxious depression. Forty patients were rescanned at week 8. At baseline, we found a negative association between global 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding and both GAD-10 score (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and anxiety/somatization factor score (p\u2009=\u20090.06). Further, remitters had a higher baseline anxiety/somatization factor score compared with non-responders (p\u2009=\u20090.04). At rescan, patients with syndromal anxious depression had a greater change in binding relative to patients with non-syndromal depression (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Concurrent anxiety in patients with depression measured by GAD-10 score and anxiety/somatization factor score is negatively associated with cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R binding. A lower binding may represent a subtype with reduced natural resilience against anxiety in a depressed state, and concurrent anxiety may influence the effect on the 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R from serotonergic antidepressants. The 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R is a promising neuroreceptor for further understanding the underpinnings of concurrent anxiety in patients with depression.",

        "title": "Comparative effectiveness of cognitive behavioral treatment, serotonin, and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors for anxiety in children and adolescents: a network meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line treatments for childhood anxiety disorders (ADs). The objective of this current analysis was to conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two in treating pediatric ADs. The studies included consisted of randomized controlled trials evaluating non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. clomipramine), SSRIs, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, CBT, or a combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy. Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were 18\u2009years or younger. A total of 86 studies were included, with a total of 7594 participants, of which 41.51% were females. For remission, all three treatments were significantly more effective than both placebo (ORs ranging from 0.07 and 0.18) and wait-list (ORs ranging from 0.06 and 0.16). In terms of the severity of anxiety symptoms, all treatment forms were significantly more effective for reducing anxiety than wait-list (standardized mean differences (SMDs) ranging from 0.98 and 2.91). Only pharmacotherapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo (SMD = 2.01, 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.01). Overall, the results demonstrate that CBT, pharmacotherapy, and their combination are effective treatments for childhood ADs. There was no significant difference between the three treatment forms. However, CBT was associated with lower attrition rates. CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two should all be considered to treat youths with ADs. However, potential risks and benefits should be considered before devising a treatment plan.",

        "title": "Expectancy effects on serotonin and dopamine transporters during SSRI treatment of social anxiety disorder: a randomized clinical trial.",
        "abstract": "It has been extensively debated whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more efficacious than placebo in affective disorders, and it is not fully understood how SSRIs exert their beneficial effects. Along with serotonin transporter blockade, altered dopamine signaling and psychological factors may contribute. In this randomized clinical trial of participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) we investigated how manipulation of verbally-induced expectancies, vital for placebo response, affect brain monoamine transporters and symptom improvement during SSRI treatment. Twenty-seven participants with SAD (17 men, 10 women), were randomized, to 9 weeks of overt or covert treatment with escitalopram 20\u2009mg. The overt group received correct treatment information whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with escitalopram, described as an active placebo in a cover story. Before and after treatment, patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) assessments with the [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I radiotracers, probing brain serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) transporters. SAD symptoms were measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Overt was superior to covert SSRI treatment, resulting in almost a fourfold higher rate of responders. PET results showed that SERT occupancy after treatment was unrelated to anxiety reduction and equally high in both groups. In contrast, DAT binding decreased in the right putamen, pallidum, and the left thalamus with overt SSRI treatment, and increased with covert treatment, resulting in significant group differences. DAT binding potential changes in these regions correlated negatively with symptom improvement. Findings support that the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs involve psychological factors contingent on dopaminergic neurotransmission while serotonin transporter blockade alone is insufficient for clinical response.",

        "abstract": "BDNF plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity events, vulnerability and resilience to stress-related disorders, being decreased in depressive patients and increased after antidepressant treatment. BDNF was found to be reduced in patients carrying the human polymorphism in the serotonin transporter promoter region (5-HTTLPR). The serotonin knockout rat (SERT<sup>-/-</sup>) is one of the animal models used to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression in humans. They present decreased BDNF levels, and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. To investigate whether upregulating BDNF would ameliorate the phenotype of SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats, we overexpressed BDNF locally into the ventral hippocampus and submitted the animals to behavioral testing. The results showed that BDNF overexpression in the vHIP of SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats promoted higher sucrose preference and sucrose intake; on the first day of the sucrose consumption test it decreased immobility time in the forced swim test and increased the time spent in the center of a novel environment. Furthermore, BDNF overexpression altered social behavior in SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats, which presented increased passive contact with test partner and decreased solitary behavior. Finally, it promoted decrease in plasma corticosterone levels 60 min after restraint stress. In conclusion, modulation of BDNF IV levels in the vHIP of SERT<sup>-/-</sup> rats led to a positive behavioral outcome placing BDNF upregulation in the vHIP as a potential target to new therapeutic approaches to improve depressive symptoms.",
