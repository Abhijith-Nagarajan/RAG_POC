        "title": "Allostatic Load and Metabolic Syndrome in Depressed Patients: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.",
        "abstract": "Allostatic load (AL) is the cumulative wear and tear on the body due to the chronic adverse physical or psychosocial situations. The acute stress response activates the primary mediators of AL, which include cortisol, epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). Secondary outcomes, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), cardiovascular, and immune system changes, can result from long-term stress responses. Given these complex reactions to an acute stressor, a multidimensional stress assessment is required when investigating individual stress reactivity in an experimental setting. This study is aimed at examining the association between the primary mediators of AL and MetS in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. MDD patients (<i>n</i> = 164, age = 18-65 years old) with MetS+ (<i>n</i> = 46, weight = 93.10 \u00b1 16.43\u2009kg) and without MetS- (<i>n</i> = 118, weight = 73.08 \u00b1 15.22\u2009kg) were analyzed cross-sectionally. Stepwise binary regression and Welch's <i>t</i>-test were used to find the associations and differences between the two groups. The regression analysis was fully adjusted for age, sex, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II score. In unadjusted model, cortisol (<i>b</i> = -0.003, <i>p</i> = 0.034) was inversely associated with MetS. In fully adjusted model, EPI (<i>b</i> = -0.006, <i>p</i> = 0.007) was inversely associated with MetS. However, significant differences (<i>p</i> = 0.005) were observed for cortisol between MDD patients without MetS- (410.13 \u00b1 144.63\u2009nmol/l) and MDD patients with MetS+ (340.90 \u00b1 132.98\u2009nmol/l) with a small effect size (Cohen's <i>d</i> of 0.489). Significant differences (<i>p</i> = 0.001) were observed for EPI between MDD patients without MetS- (185.67 \u00b1 124.44\u2009pg/ml) and MDD patients with MetS+ (124.95 \u00b1 84.38\u2009pg/ml) with a moderate effect size (Cohen's <i>d</i> of 0.530). These observations are of clinical importance for the management of MDD patients.",

        "abstract": "The heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) has hindered clinical translation and neuromarker identification. Biotyping facilitates solving the problems of heterogeneity, by dissecting MDD patients into discrete subgroups. However, interindividual variations suggest that depression may be conceptualized as a \"continuum,\" rather than as a \"category.\" We use a Bayesian model to decompose structural MRI features of MDD patients from a multisite cross-sectional cohort into three latent disease factors (spatial pattern) and continuum factor compositions (individual expression). The disease factors are associated with distinct neurotransmitter receptors/transporters obtained from open PET sources. Increases cortical thickness in sensory and decreases in orbitofrontal cortices (Factor 1) associate with norepinephrine and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> density, decreases in the cingulo-opercular network and subcortex (Factor 2) associate with norepinephrine and 5-HTT density, and increases in social and affective brain systems (Factor 3) relate to 5-HTT density. Disease factor patterns can also be used to predict depressive symptom improvement in patients from the longitudinal cohort. Moreover, individual factor expressions in MDD are stable over time in a longitudinal cohort, with differentially expressed disease controls from a transdiagnostic cohort. Collectively, our data-driven disease factors reveal that patients with MDD organize along continuous dimensions that affect distinct sets of regions.",

        "abstract": "When discussing neurotransmitters whose signaling plays an important role in psychiatric illnesses, serotonin and dopamine may be the first that come to mind. Although serotonin and dopamine have significant roles, the impact of norepinephrine signaling is often overlooked. A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperactivity of norepinephrine signaling is an underlying issue in psychiatric disorders; conversely, there is evidence to suggest that deficits in the noradrenergic system are just as significant. Hence, alterations in noradrenergic activity are better characterized as dysregulation rather than a reductive, outdated formulation of \"too much\" or \"too little\" activity. Therefore, symptoms such as agitation, irritability, hyperarousal, and insomnia could be treated by targeting the underlying pathophysiology related to noradrenergic dysregulation with targeted treatments. In a recent consensus panel meeting, 5 experts reviewed the available evidence of altered noradrenergic activity and its potential role in some of the most common psychiatric disorders. This Academic Highlights article summarizes their discussion and presents the panel's conclusions.",

        "abstract": "Stressful events, from daily stressors to traumatic experiences, are common and occur at any age. Despite the high prevalence of trauma, not everyone develops stress-related disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a variation attributed to resilience, the ability to adapt and avoid negative consequences of significant stress. This review examines the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a critical component in the brain's stress response. It discusses the LC-NE system's anatomical and functional complexity and its role in individual variability in stress responses. How different etiological factors and stress modalities affect the LC-NE system, influencing both adaptive stress responses and psychopathologies, are discussed and supported by evidence from human and animal studies. It also explores molecular and cellular adaptations in the LC that contribute to resilience, including roles of neuropeptide, inflammatory cytokines, and genetic modulation, and addresses developmental and sex differences in stress vulnerability. The need for a multifaceted approach to understand stress-induced psychopathologies is emphasized and pave the way for more personalized interventions for stress-related disorders.",

Research has indicated that the antidepressant effect of esketamine are mediated by monoamine transmitters and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we postulate that intravenous administration of esketamine in patients with postpartum depression may alter the serum concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Three hundred fifteen patients with postpartum depression were selected and divided into two groups based on randomized numerical expression: esketamine (E) group (0. 25\u00a0mg/kg esketamine) and control (C) group (a same volume of 0.9% saline), all the drugs were pumped for 40\u00a0min. After the end of drug pumping, all patients were continuously observed for 2\u00a0h. Changes in serum levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, BDNF were recorded before drug administration and on the 3rd day after drug administration. The scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were calculated before drug administration, and on the 3rd day and on the 30th day after drug administration. Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and feeling of detachment occurred were recorded within 2\u00a0h after drug administration. Before drug administration, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (0. 91\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 19 vs. 0. 98\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 21, P\u2009=\u20090. 181), (2. 38\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 35 vs. 2. 32\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 32, P\u2009=\u20090. 491), (3. 07\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 89 vs 3. 02\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 88, P\u2009=\u20090. 828), (39. 79\u2009\u00b1\u20097. 78 vs 41. 34\u2009\u00b1\u200910. 03, P\u2009=\u20090. 506).

Before medication, the EPDS scores were (16. 15\u2009\u00b1\u20093. 02 vs 17. 85\u2009\u00b1\u20093. 89, P\u2009=\u20090. 064). on the third day after medication, the Group E had significantly reduced scores (12. 98\u2009\u00b1\u20092. 39 vs 16. 73\u2009\u00b1\u20093. 52, P\u2009<\u20090. 001).

        "abstract": "Depressive disorders are a common and debilitating form of mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society. Despite the high prevalence, the underlying causes and mechanisms of depressive disorders are still poorly understood. Neurochemical systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, have been implicated in the development and perpetuation of depressive symptoms. Current treatments for depression target these neuromodulator systems, but there is a need for a better understanding of their role in order to develop more effective treatments. Monitoring neurochemical dynamics during depressive symptoms is crucial for gaining a better a understanding of their involvement in depressive disorders. Genetically encoded sensors have emerged recently that offer high spatial-temporal resolution and the ability to monitor neurochemical dynamics in real time. This review explores the neurochemical systems involved in depression and discusses the applications and limitations of current monitoring tools for neurochemical dynamics. It also highlights the potential of genetically encoded sensors for better characterizing neurochemical dynamics in depression-related behaviors. Furthermore, potential improvements to current sensors are discussed in order to meet the requirements of depression research.",

A total of 120 women aged 24 to 36 years old who underwent labor analgesia by epidural analgesia pump, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status II were enrolled. According to the formula of epidural analgesia pump, all participants were randomly divided into two groups: esketamine group (Group E) and control group (Group C). Epidural anaesthesia were operated in all women between L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> after cervical dilation up to 2\u2009~\u20093\u00a0cm. After successful puncture, the epidural catheter was placed 3.5\u00a0cm toward the head and 1% lidocaine was injected for 3\u00a0ml. The epidural analgesia pump was connected. Esketamine (0.2\u00a0mg/kg) combined with 0.75% ropivacaine hydrochloride (20\u00a0ml) were diluted by normal saline up to 100\u00a0ml in Group E, when only the equal dose of ropivacaine hydrochloride was used in Group C. The visual analogue scale (VAS) before analgesia (T<sub>1</sub>), 5 (T<sub>2</sub>), 10 (T<sub>3</sub>) and 20 (T<sub>4</sub>) minutes after analgesia were measured. The duration of the first and second stage of labor, the Apgar score of fetus at delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, consumption of esketamine and ropivacaine were recorded. The incidence of PPD was recorded at 1 week and 6 weeks after delivering. The occurrence of side effects such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and nightmares were also recorded for 48\u00a0h after delivering. The levels of leptin, norepinephrine(NE), and epinephrine(E) in the peripheral venous blood were measured before labor analgesia and at 24\u00a0h, 1 week, and 6 weeks after delivering. Compared with Group C, the VAS score at T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> were significantly lower in Group E (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Compared with Group C, the incidence of PPD was significantly lower at 1 week and 6 weeks after delivering in Group E (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Compared with Group C, the levels of leptin were significantly higher at 24\u00a0h and 1 week after delivering in Group E (P\u2009<\u20090.01), while NE and E (P\u2009<\u20090.01) were lower at the same time (P\u2009<\u20090.01). There were no significant difference of the duration of the first and second stage of labor, the Apgar score of fetus at delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, consumption of ropivacaine and the side effects for 48\u00a0h after delivering between the two groups. Esketamine combined with ropivacaine hydrochloride used in labor analgesia can significantly reduce the incidence of postpartum depression after delivering without increasing related side effects, which may be related to the regulation of leptin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the serum.

These findings suggest that SSRIs may improve asthma control in patients without MDD. <b>Objective:</b> The current retrospective study examined the effect of SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) on asthma control in adult patients. We hypothesized that patients would have fewer asthma exacerbations after treatment with an SSRI or SNRI. <b>Methods:</b> Electronic health record data of adult patients (N = 592) who were seen at a University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) hospital or clinic and had (1) an SSRI or SNRI prescription, (2) a previous asthma diagnosis, and (3) no mood disorder diagnosis were extracted by using the UTSW Clinical Data Exchange Network. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare oral corticosteroid prescriptions and asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in the 12 months before and after the start of an SSRI/SNRI. <b>Results:</b> Therapy with SSRIs/SNRIs was associated with a significant decrease in oral corticosteroid use (p = 0.003), ED visits (p = 0.002), and hospitalizations (p < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Results from the current study add to the existing literature by demonstrating a reduced rate of severe exacerbations in patients with asthma by using an SSRI/SNRI without limiting the analytic sample to a high-illness-severity subgroup defined by symptoms of asthma or depression.

While the second-generation antidepressants are widely accepted as first-line pharmacological treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), patient response to such treatment is variable, with more than half failing to achieve complete remission, and residual symptoms are frequently present. Here, the pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine XR are reviewed in relation to its role as both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and we look at how these pharmacodynamic properties can be harnessed to guide clinical practice, asking the question 'is it possible to develop a symptom-cluster-based approach to the treatment of MDD with comorbid anxiety utilizing venlafaxine XR?.' Additionally, three illustrative clinical cases provide practical examples of the utility of venlafaxine-XR in real-world clinical practice. The place of venlafaxine XR in managing fatigue/low energy, a frequent residual symptom in MDD, is explored using pooled data from clinical trials of venlafaxine XR. Venlafaxine XR should be considered as a first-line treatment for MDD with or without comorbid anxiety, and there are clear pharmacodynamic signals supporting a symptom cluster-based treatment paradigm for venlafaxine XR.",

Given the relative dearth of information regarding rationales for their preferred use as first-line ADs in the broad clinical routine, the present study systematically investigated real-world characteristics of MDD patients prescribed either SNRIs or other AD substances across different countries and treatment settings. In the present secondary analyses based on a large European, multi-site, naturalistic and cross-sectional investigation with a retrospective assessment of treatment outcome, we firstly defined the proportion of MDD patients receiving SNRIs as first-line AD psychopharmacotherapy and secondly compared their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to those patients prescribed alternative first-line ADs during their current major depressive episode (MDE). Within the total sample of 1410 MDD patients, 336 (23.8\u00a0%) received first-line SNRIs. Compared to other ADs, SNRIs were significantly associated with inpatient care, suicidality and treatment resistance during the current MDE, and a longer lifetime duration of psychiatric hospitalizations. Moreover, greater severity of depressive symptoms at study entry, higher daily doses of the administered ADs, as well as more frequent prescriptions of psychopharmacotherapeutic add-on strategies in general and antipsychotic augmentation in particular, were significantly related to first-line SNRIs. Considering the limitations of a cross-sectional and retrospective study design, our data point towards a preferred use of first-line SNRIs in a generally more severely ill MDD patients, although they did not lead to superior treatment outcomes compared to alternative ADs.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous disease, which brings great difficulties to clinical diagnosis and therapy. Its mechanism is still unknown. Prior neuroimaging studies mainly focused on mean differences between patients and healthy controls (HC), largely ignoring individual differences between patients. This study included 112 MDD patients and 93 HC subjects. Resting-state functional MRI data were obtained to examine the patterns of individual variability of brain functional connectivity (IVFC). The genetic risk of pathways including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and synaptic plasticity was assessed by multilocus genetic profile scores (MGPS), respectively. The IVFC pattern of the MDD group was similar but higher than that in HCs. The inter-network functional connectivity in the default mode network contributed to altered IVFC in MDD. 5-HT, NE, and HPA pathway genes affected IVFC in MDD patients. The age of onset, duration, severity, and treatment response, were correlated with IVFC. IVFC in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex had a mediating effect between MGPS of the 5-HT pathway and baseline depression severity. Environmental factors and differences in locations of functional areas across individuals were not taken into account. This study found MDD patients had significantly different inter-individual functional connectivity variations than healthy people, and genetic risk might affect clinical manifestations through brain function heterogeneity.",

In this context, this article aims to present two case reports of BUP XL unapproved use and a review of the mechanism of action, formulations, and the clinical profile of BUP. Two case reports. The patients' data for the case reports were obtained from their medical records. A PubMed search was conducted using the terms BUP, inmates, and efficacy to identify randomized and non-randomized controlled trials and case reports to evaluate the possible effects of BUP in prison settings. Only approved medications were included. The positive effects of BUP XL on major depressive disorder treatment are well-reported, but few reports are on the pharmacokinetics of BUP XL in prisons. The exact mechanism of its effect on the central nervous system is predominantly connected with its unique pharmacokinetics. This paper shows that BUP XL will continue to play an essential role in treating a major depressive disorder in adults in prisons and other related disorders, although a different treatment strategy should be preferred in patients with high addictive potential. Because of a similar mechanism of action, the most appropriate alternatives for BUP XL could be mirtazapine, agomelatine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine, although clinical trials are needed to confirm these alternatives.",

Trazodone hydrochloride is an antidepressant medicine that affects the chemical messengers in the brain known as neurotransmitters, which include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. In the present research, in solid and liquid phases, the 1:1 charge-transfer complexes between trazodone hydrochloride (TZD) and six different \u03c0-acceptors were synthesized and investigated using different microscopic techniques. The relation of dative ion pairs [TZD+, A-], where A is the acceptor, was inferred via intermolecular charge-transfer complexes. Additionally, a molecular docking examination was utilized to compare the interactions of protein receptors (serotonin-6BQH) with the TZD alone or in combination with the six distinct acceptor charge-transfer complexes. To refine the docking results acquired from AutoDock Vina and to better examine the molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions, a 100 ns run of molecular dynamics simulation was used. All the results obtained in this study prove that the 2,6-dichloroquinone-4-chloroimide (DCQ)/TZD complex interacts with serotonin receptors more efficiently than reactant donor TZD only and that [(TZD)(DCQ)]-serotonin has the highest binding energy value of all \u03c0-acceptor complexes.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors (D<sub>1</sub>Rs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are essential for antidepressant effects. However, the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, the major source of dopamine in the brain, only sparsely project to DG, suggesting possible activation of DG D<sub>1</sub>Rs by endogenous substances other than dopamine. We have examined this possibility using electrophysiological and biochemical techniques and found robust activation of D<sub>1</sub>Rs in mouse DG neurons by noradrenaline. Noradrenaline at the micromolar range potentiated synaptic transmission at the DG output and increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase A substrates in DG via activation of D<sub>1</sub>Rs and \u03b2 adrenergic receptors. Neuronal excitation preferentially enhanced noradrenaline-induced synaptic potentiation mediated by D<sub>1</sub>Rs with minor effects on \u03b2-receptor-dependent potentiation. Increased voluntary exercise by wheel running also enhanced noradrenaline-induced, D<sub>1</sub>R-mediated synaptic potentiation, suggesting a distinct functional role of the noradrenaline-D<sub>1</sub>R signaling. We then examined the role of this signaling in antidepressant effects using mice exposed to chronic restraint stress. In the stressed mice, an antidepressant acting on the noradrenergic system induced a mature-to-immature change in the DG neuron phenotype, a previously proposed cellular substrate for antidepressant action. This effect was evident only in mice subjected to wheel running and blocked by a D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist. These results suggest a critical role of noradrenaline-induced activation of D<sub>1</sub>Rs in antidepressant effects in DG. Experience-dependent regulation of noradrenaline-D<sub>1</sub>R signaling may determine responsiveness to antidepressant drugs in depressive disorders.",

The retina is endowed with a complex neurotransmission system, composed of the main neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. The retina is therefore a relevant site of investigation for the identification of reliable and robust markers. However, the effects of antidepressants on the human retina are poorly studied. Here, we seek to study the potential specific effects of various antidepressants on retinal function in MDD patients. We assessed retinal function using flash (fERG), pattern (PERG) and multifocal (mfERG) electroretinogram in 19 MDD patients treated using antidepressants at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 and 12. We observed reduced b-wave amplitude of photopic fERG 3.0 in patients treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in comparison with patients treated with Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCAD). We also showed that SNRIs were associated both with a decrease in PERG P50 implicit time and an increase in fERG 3.0\u00a0b-wave amplitude. TCADs were associated with an increase in fERG flicker 3.0 a- and b-wave amplitude. This is the first study in real-life conditions to show a specific effect of various antidepressants on retinal function evaluated by electroretinogram. Further investigations should be led to specify the effects of antidepressants on ERG in order to isolate reliable and reproducible markers for predicting and monitoring the response to antidepressants.",

        "abstract": "It is known that both selective serotonin and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SSRI, SNRI) are first-line drugs for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It has also been considered that both SSRI and SNRI can improve the symptoms of major depressive disorder by increasing the concentration of monoamine in the synaptic cleft based on the monoamine hypothesis. However, accumulating evidence has indicated that inflammation in the brain may be a key factor in the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the development of major depressive disorder. It has been advocated that microglial cells may regulate the inflammatory response under pathological conditions such as major depressive disorder. In this study, we focused on whether duloxetine can ameliorate the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BV-2 microglial cells. Our results indicated that duloxetine significantly decreased the NO production induced by LPS. The increase in the protein expression level of iNOS induced by LPS was significantly decreased by treatment with duloxetine. Moreover, the increases in the protein expression levels of phosphorylated-I\u03baB\u03b1, phosphorylated-Akt and Akt induced by LPS were also significantly decreased. Unexpectedly, the protein expression levels of other pro-inflammatory factors such as COX-2 and the phosphorylation ratios for various molecules including I\u03baB\u03b1 and Akt were not changed by treatment with duloxetine. These findings suggest that duloxetine may have an anti-inflammatory effect, which could contribute to its therapeutic effectiveness for major depressive disorder.",

        "title": "Determination of Patient Adherence for Duloxetine in Urine.",
        "abstract": "Duloxetine, known by its brand name, CymbaltaTM, is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used to treat major depressive disorders. Determination of patient compliance for duloxetine is typically determined through medication possession ratio (MPR) or plasma concentrations. The purpose of this paper was to characterize normal urinary duloxetine concentrations in patients prescribed duloxetine to monitor patient adherence. Patient data collected from routine screens for duloxetine concentrations in urine were included in this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who were prescribed duloxetine and (i) tested positive for duloxetine, (ii) tested negative for illicit substances and (iii) included creatinine, age and duloxetine dose administered. Of the 5,592 patient urines screened, 2,004 of the results fit into the inclusion criteria. Positive urine concentrations of duloxetine ranged from 50 to 2,722\u2009ng/mL. Duloxetine urine concentrations were normalized to creatinine and dose further characterized by sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and dose in milligrams. Sample distribution included urines collected from 1,487 females and 517 males. The age range of the specimen donors was between 15 and 90\u2009years old with an average age of 52. BMI levels ranged from 13.9 (underweight) to 88.1 (obese), with the average BMI being 33.5. The most common dose of duloxetine prescribed was a daily, oral dose of 60\u2009mg. Analysis of the normalized, transformed creatinine concentrations showed that there was a significant statistical difference (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the urinary duloxetine concentrations by sex and by dose (mg). Female patients further showed a statistical difference in urinary duloxetine concentration in age groups 18-64 and 64 and older. By characterizing urinary duloxetine concentrations in patients prescribed the medication, normalized distributions of data ranges have been established. These data ranges for urinary duloxetine concentrations can be used to determine patient compliance with duloxetine in routine, clinical samples.",

        "title": "The Relationships Among Metal Homeostasis, Mitochondria, and Locus Coeruleus in Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders: Potential Pathogenetic Mechanism and Therapeutic Implications.",
        "abstract": "While alterations in the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system are present during early stages of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is unclear what causes these changes and how they contribute to other pathologies in these conditions. Data suggest that the onset of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia is associated with metal dyshomeostasis that causes glial cell mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperactivation in the locus coeruleus. The effect of the overactive locus coeruleus on the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex can be responsible for some of the psychiatric symptoms. Although locus coeruleus overactivation may diminish over time, neuroinflammation-induced alterations are presumably ongoing due to continued metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In early Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction likely induce locus coeruleus hyperactivation, pathological tau or \u03b1-synuclein formation, and neurodegeneration, while reduction of glymphatic and cerebrospinal fluid flow might be responsible for \u03b2-amyloid aggregation in the olfactory regions before the onset of dementia. It is possible that the overactive noradrenergic system stimulates the apoptosis signaling pathway and pathogenic protein formation, leading to further pathological changes which can occur in the presence or absence of locus coeruleus hypoactivation. Data are presented in this review indicating that although locus coeruleus hyperactivation is involved in pathological changes at prodromal and early stages of these neuropsychiatric disorders, metal dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction are critical factors in maintaining ongoing neuropathology throughout the course of these conditions. The proposed mechanistic model includes multiple pharmacological sites that may be targeted for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders commonly.",

        "abstract": "Neurotransmitter metabolism plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, whether the neurotransmitter metabolism in adolescent MDD is differentiated from adult MDD is still elusive. In the current study, plasma concentrations of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters as well as their metabolites, including tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine (NE), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), glutamine (GLN), glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were measured and compared in two cohorts of subjects (adult cohort: 31 first-episode MDD vs. 35 healthy controls; adolescent cohort: 33 first-episode MDD vs. 30 healthy controls). To assess the effects of antidepressant treatment, we also analyzed the concentrations of these indexes pre- and post-treatment in adult and adolescent cohorts. At baseline, the deficits of neurotransmitter metabolism in adult MDD were manifested in all the neurotransmitter systems. In contrast, for adolescent MDD, the dysregulation of neurotransmission was mainly indicated in the catecholaminergic systems. After antidepressant treatment, adult MDD showed increased TRP, KYN, KYNA and GLU levels, together with decreased levels of 5-HIAA and DOPAC. Adolescent MDD illustrated an increased level of 5-HT and decreased levels of TRP and GABA. The improvements of Hamilton total scores correlated with the changes in plasma TRP and the turnover of KYN/TRP after treatment in all MDD patients. However, these correlations were only manifested in the adult MDD rather than in adolescent MDD patients. The findings highlight the shared and distinguished neurotransmitter pathways in MDD and emphasize the different antidepressant responses between adults and adolescents. Potentially, the neurotransmitters above could serve as diagnostic biomarkers and provide a novel pharmacological treatment strategy for MDD.",

        "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Women service members of the past 20 years experienced high rates of traumatizing events resulting in pharmacological treatment. Post-military lives may include having children. Typically, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients' pregnancies are managed outside the VHA. This study examined medication exposures during pregnancy. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The Center for Maternal and Infant Outcomes Research in Translation (COMFORT) study collected primary survey data and linked secondary health care data from the VHA from 2015 to 2021. Medication fills and covariates were extracted for three 9-month periods: preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum. Multiple regression assessed factors associated with use during pregnancy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or of non-recommended, potentially risky drugs, and of discontinuation of those medications from prepregnancy to pregnancy. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The cohort comprised 501 women-29% Black, 65% White, and 6% other races, of whom 63% had 50%-100% service-connected disability. During pregnancy, 36% had a pain-related disorder, 19% major depression, and 18% post-traumatic stress disorder. The median number of drug classes prescribed during pregnancy was 5. The use of SSRI/SNRI antidepressants dropped from 36% preconception to 26% during pregnancy including new starts; 15% discontinued SSRI/SNRI. Comorbidity predicted medication use. Depression predicted discontinuing SSRI/SNRI during pregnancy; no predictors of discontinuing potentially risky drugs were identified. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Based on prescriptions filled within the VHA only-ignoring potential community-based fills-women veterans were prescribed numerous medications during pregnancy and discontinued antidepressants alarmingly. Veterans of childbearing potential should receive counseling about medication use before pregnancy occurs. Their non-VHA obstetricians and VHA providers should share information to optimize outcomes, reviewing medications as soon as pregnancy is detected as well as after pregnancy concludes.",

        "title": "The Antidepressant Duloxetine Inhibits Platelet Function and Protects against Thrombosis.",
        "abstract": "While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the primary cause of disability, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Interestingly, there is evidence that CVD is more prevalent in people with MDD. It is well established that neurotransmitters, namely serotonin and norepinephrine, are involved in the biochemical mechanisms of MDD, and consequently, drugs targeting serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake, such as duloxetine, are commonly prescribed for MDD. In this connection, serotonin and norepinephrine are also known to play critical roles in primary hemostasis. Based on these considerations, we investigated if duloxetine can be repurposed as an antiplatelet medication. Our results-using human and/or mouse platelets show that duloxetine dose-dependently inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation, compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, it also blocked agonist-induced dense and \u03b1-granule secretion, integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, phosphatidylserine expression, and clot retraction. Moreover duloxetine-treated mice had a significantly prolonged occlusion time. Finally, duloxetine was also found to impair hemostasis. Collectively, our data indicate that the antidepressant duloxetine, which is a serotonin-norepinephrine antagonist, exerts antiplatelet and thromboprotective effects and inhibits hemostasis. Consequently, duloxetine, or a rationally designed derivative, presents potential benefits in the context of CVD, including that associated with MDD.",

        "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are used as first-line treatment for many psychiatric diseases, especially major depressive disorder. However, an important side effect of these drugs is the risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of hematuria in patients using SSRI/SNRIs and to compare with a control group. This study included patients who were followed up and treated with SSRI/SNRI in the psychiatric outpatient clinic of the Antalya Medical Park Hospital between 1 January 2021 and 31 March 2021 and a control group comprising patients who presented to the medical check-up outpatient clinic between the same dates.

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with sympathetic overactivity and alterations in peripheral adrenergic receptor function; however, no studies have directly assessed vasoconstrictor responsiveness in adults with MDD. We tested the hypotheses that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilation would be blunted in adults with MDD compared with healthy nondepressed adults (HA) and would functionally contribute to exaggerated norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction. In 13 HA (8 female; 24\u00b14 years) and in 12 adults with MDD (8 female; 22\u00b13 yrs), red blood cell flux was measured during graded intradermal microdialysis perfusion of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (10<sup>-10</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>4</sup> mol/L) and, separately, during the perfusion of norepinephrine (10<sup>-</sup><sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup> mol/L), alone and in combination with the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 mmol/L). Nonadrenergic vasoconstriction was assessed via perfusion of angiotensin II (10<sup>-</sup><sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>4</sup> mol/L). Isoproterenol-induced vasodilation was blunted in adults with MDD (188.9\u00b170.1 HA versus 128.3\u00b139.4 au MDD, <i>P</i>=0.025). Net norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was exaggerated in adults with MDD (-0.16\u00b10.54 HA versus -0.75\u00b10.56 au MDD, <i>P</i>=0.014); however, there were no group differences in angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Propranolol potentiated norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in HA (-0.16\u00b10.54 norepinephrine versus -1.60\u00b11.40 au propranolol, <i>P</i><0.01) but had no effect in adults with MDD (-0.75\u00b10.56 norepinephrine versus -1.58\u00b11.56 au propranolol, <i>P</i>=0.08). \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-mediated microvascular vasodilation was blunted in adults with MDD and contributed to exaggerated adrenergic vasoconstriction. The relative loss of the vasoprotective effect of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilation may contribute to increased peripheral resistance, thereby driving the development of hypertension in adults with MDD.",

        "title": "The Role of the Locus Coeruleus in Pain and Associated Stress-Related Disorders.",
        "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC)-noradrenergic system is the main source of noradrenaline in the central nervous system and is involved intensively in modulating pain and stress-related disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder and anxiety) and in their comorbidity. However, the mechanisms involving the LC that underlie these effects have not been fully elucidated, in part owing to the technical difficulties inherent in exploring such a tiny nucleus. However, novel research tools are now available that have helped redefine the LC system, moving away from the traditional view of LC as a homogeneous structure that exerts a uniform influence on neural activity. Indeed, innovative techniques such as DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) and optogenetics have demonstrated the functional heterogeneity of LC, and novel magnetic resonance imaging applications combined with pupillometry have opened the way to evaluate LC activity in\u00a0vivo. This review aims to bring together the data available on the efferent activity of the LC-noradrenergic system in relation to pain and its comorbidity with anxiodepressive disorders. Acute pain triggers a robust LC stress response, producing spinal cord-mediated endogenous analgesia while promoting aversion, vigilance, and threat detection through its ascending efferents. However, this protective biological system fails in chronic pain, and LC activity produces pain facilitation, anxiety, increased aversive memory, and behavioral despair, acting at the medulla, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala levels. Thus, the activation/deactivation of specific LC projections contributes to different behavioral outcomes in the shift from acute to chronic pain.",
