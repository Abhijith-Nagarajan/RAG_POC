        "title": "Plasma neuropeptide levels in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder and healthy controls: A multiplex immunoassay study.",
        "abstract": "We aimed to compare neuropeptide levels between patients with major psychiatric disorders and healthy controls and examine their association with symptoms and cognitive function. The participants were 149 patients with schizophrenia, 115 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 186 unremitted patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 350 healthy controls. Psychiatric (schizophrenic, manic, and depressive) symptoms, sleep state, and cognitive (premorbid intelligence quotient, general cognitive, and memory) functions were evaluated. A multiplex immunoassay kit was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels. The verification assay revealed that CSF \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were too low to be reliably measured, while plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels could be successfully measured. Plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly different between patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and healthy controls. Plasma \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-endorphin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and substance P levels were not significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, BD, or MDD and cognitive function scores in patients or healthy controls. Our data suggest that plasma neuropeptide levels do not elucidate the involvement of neuropeptides in the pathology of schizophrenia, BD, or MDD.",

        "title": "Evidence of alterations of Beta-endorphin levels and Mu-opioid receptor gene expression in bipolar disorder.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well-recognized effects of endogenous opioids on mood and behavior, research on its role in bipolar disorder (BD) is still limited to small or anecdotal reports. Considering that Beta-endorphins (\u03b2-END) and Mu-opioid receptors (MOR), in particular, have a crucial activity in affective modulation, we hypothesized their alteration in BD. A cross-sectional study was conducted. We compared: (1) BD type I (BD-I) patients (n\u00a0=\u00a050) vs healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a027), (2) two BD-I subject subgroups: manic (MAN; n\u00a0=\u00a025) vs depressed (DEP; n\u00a0=\u00a025) subjects. Plasma levels of \u03b2-END and MOR gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed using ELISA Immunoassay qRT-PCR. We found that subjects with BD exhibited a significant upregulation of MOR gene expression and a decrease of \u03b2-END (p<0.0001 for both). MAN display higher MOR levels than DEP (p<0.001) and HC (p<0.0001). Plasma levels of \u03b2-END were lower in DEP compared to MAN (p<0.05) and HC (p<0.0001). The main limitations are the cross-sectional design and the lack of a group of euthymic subjects. Although preliminary, our results suggest a dysregulation of the endogenous opioid systems in BD. In particular, both MAN and DEP showed a reduction of \u03b2-END levels, whereas MAN was associated with MOR gene overexpression.",

        "abstract": "Alterations in prolactin and beta-endorphin serum levels after ECT are well-established findings in depression. The present study focuses on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) response patterns of the mentioned parameters in patients suffering from acute mania. Following the first three ECTs of a treatment series in 19 patients diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria as suffering from mania, blood samples were drawn before, and 20, 30 and 40 minutes after ECT. Serum prolactin and beta-endorphin levels were established in order to gain information about the effects of ECT on different neurotransmitter systems. A significant transient increase in serum prolactin after ECT was found. Furthermore, in females but not males, delta(max)prolactin diminished over the course of treatment as prolactin baseline levels increased. beta-endorphin levels showed a stable transient increase after ECT stimulus regardless from sex or treatment. The reported findings reflect those established in depression. This suggests that they are epiphenomenal to ECT.",

        "title": "Evidence against changes in corticotroph CRF receptors in depressed patients.",
        "abstract": "Previous studies by a number have investigators have documented a decreased adrenocortotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin/beta-endorphin (beta-End) response to ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (oCRF) in depressed patients. Since depressed patients demonstrate higher plasma cortisol concentrations at the time of oCRF challenge, it is difficult to determine if the decreased ACTH response is due to enhanced negative feedback of cortisol on ACTH release or an alteration in CRF receptors in depressed patients. To evaluate the response to oCRF in an \"open feedback loop\" system, we administered metyrapone 750 mg at 4 PM and 7:30 PM, followed by administration of oCRF 0.3 microgram/kg at 8 PM in 10 normal controls and 10 depressed patients. Administration of metyrapone at this time in the circadian rhythm clamped plasma cortisol concentrations to less than 2 micrograms/dl but did not result in rebound ACTH or beta-End secretion in control subjects. In control subjects, metyrapone administration produced a 85% blockade of the cortisol response as well as a 3-fold greater beta-End response compared to administration of the same dose of oCRF without metyrapone. The 10 depressed patients and their matched controls demonstrated identical beta-End responses (integrated response for controls = 291 +/- 61, for patients = 352 +/- 86) and cortisol responses (integrated response for controls = 187 +/- 38, for patients = 206 +/- 52) to oCRF following metyrapone pretreatment. These data confirm that corticotroph CRF receptors are normal in depressed patients, and that cortisol feedback plays an essential role in the abnormal ACTH and beta-End response to oCRF in depressed patients.",

        "abstract": "We studied glucocorticoid receptor autoregulation and corticotropin response to dexamethasone in depressed patients and controls, attempting to control for the confounding effect of endogenous glucocorticoids. After depletion of endogenous cortisol, depressed patients showed an attenuated suppressibility of corticotropin by dexamethasone in the face of unchanged dexamethasone plasma levels. Beta-endorphin levels were strongly correlated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations. Although metyrapone administration resulted in a marked rise of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell in controls, this effect was not present in depressives. These data support the hypothesis of a decreased glucocorticoid receptor plasticity and a partial steroid resistance in depression.",

We examined whether the same unusual responses were present also for beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) in 15 PAD patients, in 9 patients with secondary affective disorders (SAD), and in 7 controls. TRH (500 micrograms iv) elicited rises of beta-EP plasma levels in 5 PAD and 2 SAD patients, and of beta-LPH in 4 PAD and 3 SAD patients. LRH (150 micrograms iv) elicited rises of plasma beta-EP levels in 2 PAD and 2 SAD patients, and of beta-LPH in 5 PAD and 2 SAD patients. No rises of beta-EP and beta-LPH plasma levels were observed in PAD patients after saline administration, nor in the controls after TRH, LRH or saline administration.",

With the exception of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, in the normal volunteers' CSF, levels of these peptides were highly correlated with one another, suggesting that: (1) some common regulatory factor may control the levels of these four peptides in CSF; and (2) CSF alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is independently regulated from the other pro-opiomelanocortin products. Some of these correlations were absent in the patient groups, suggesting subtle alterations in pro-opiomelanocortin processing in manic-depressive illness. No effect of lithium on the CSF levels of these peptides was observed. No group differences were found.",

CSF measures (both \"raw\" variables and ranks) were uni- and multivariately correlated with both dichotomized and scored measures of hallucinations of any type. Hallucinations were statistically strongly associated with higher HVA levels, irrespective of prior medication with neuroleptics, and with the interactive product HVA X EndFI and the interactive ratio HVA/5-HIAA. Results suggest interactions between dopaminergic, serotonergic and endorphinergic neurotransmission being involved in the biochemical substrate of depressive hallucinatory episodes.",

The consideration of methodologic differences in assay technique and in clinical methods is important in evaluating results of studies. Whereas findings in early clinical studies supported the notion of increased endorphin system function in patients with schizophrenia, cumulative data from the considerable number of studies carried out throughout world centers have been unable to demonstrate a consistent abnormality in levels of endorphins in CSF or plasma of patients with schizophrenia. Among the affective disorders, data suggest the possibility of relative changes in levels of opioids within individual manic-depressive patients when studied across state change from depression to mania. In studies of depressive illness there is accumulating evidence that the endogenous opioid system may relate or contribute to abnormality of the HPA axis. In our work measuring opioids in CSF we have observed relationships between anxiety and CSF opioids in normals and psychiatric patients and changes in CSF opioid activity in patients with anorexia nervosa accompanying weight change. These data are consistent with other evidence linking endorphins to CNS noradrenergic systems and to biologic response to stress.",
