        "title": "A novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor induces antidepressant, pro-cognitive, and anti-anhedonic effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats: The role of the ghrelin-dopamine cascade.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often treatment resistant, particularly in addressing anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Novel pharmacological strategies are needed. While butyrylcholinesterase, ghrelin, and dopamine (DA) have been well studied in the context of stress and MDD, their interaction remains unclear. The dose-dependent antidepressant effects of a novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor (BChEI) were evaluated in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model of MDD. Behavioural assessments included the forced swim test (despair), sucrose preference test (reward-related), and novel object recognition test (cognition). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acetylcholine (ACh), and brain monoamines were analysed, as well as serum growth hormone and acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin. To confirm the role of ghrelin, pharmacological exploration was undertaken using the ghrelin receptor antagonist, D-Lys-3-GHRP-6. FSL rats had significantly lower ghrelin ratios, BDNF, ACh, DA and growth hormone levels. In FSL rats, both BChEI and escitalopram significantly reduced despair. BChEI significantly outperformed escitalopram in enhancing reward-related and cognitive behaviours. Biochemically, BChEI treatment significantly increased ghrelin ratios and brain DA levels without altering brain 5-HT, ACh or BDNF. D-Lys-3-GHRP-6 significantly reversed the antidepressant-like, rewarding, and pro-cognitive effects of BChEI, accompanied by significant reductions in BDNF and DA. FSL rats display impaired ghrelin, DA, serotonin, growth hormone, and BDNF signalling, akin to MDD. BChEI exerts antidepressant-like effects across despair, reward, and cognitive domains, most likely via the BChE-ghrelin-DA cascade. Reversal of these effects by ghrelin antagonism underscores the critical role of ghrelin, specifically via growth hormone secretagogue receptor-ghrelin interaction. These findings suggest a potentially novel multimodal neurobiological target for the treatment of MDD.",

        "title": "Attempting to Increase the Effectiveness of the Antidepressant Trazodone Hydrochloride Drug Using \u03c0-Acceptors.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a prevalent mood illness that is mildly heritable. Cases with the highest familial risk had recurrence and onset at a young age. Trazodone hydrochloride is an antidepressant medicine that affects the chemical messengers in the brain known as neurotransmitters, which include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. In the present research, in solid and liquid phases, the 1:1 charge-transfer complexes between trazodone hydrochloride (TZD) and six different \u03c0-acceptors were synthesized and investigated using different microscopic techniques. The relation of dative ion pairs [TZD+, A-], where A is the acceptor, was inferred via intermolecular charge-transfer complexes. Additionally, a molecular docking examination was utilized to compare the interactions of protein receptors (serotonin-6BQH) with the TZD alone or in combination with the six distinct acceptor charge-transfer complexes. To refine the docking results acquired from AutoDock Vina and to better examine the molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions, a 100 ns run of molecular dynamics simulation was used. All the results obtained in this study prove that the 2,6-dichloroquinone-4-chloroimide (DCQ)/TZD complex interacts with serotonin receptors more efficiently than reactant donor TZD only and that [(TZD)(DCQ)]-serotonin has the highest binding energy value of all \u03c0-acceptor complexes.",

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated reductions in nitric oxide (NO)-dependent dilation are evident in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the upstream mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation-induced ROS production contributes to microvascular endothelial dysfunction in MDD. Thirteen treatment-naive adults with MDD (6 women; 19-23 yr) and 10 healthy nondepressed adults (HAs; 5 women; 20-25 yr) were tested before and after (open-label design) systemic NF-\u03baB knockdown (nonacetylated salicylate; 3,000-4,500 mg/day \u00d7 4 days). Red cell flux (laser Doppler flowmetry) was measured during graded intradermal microdialysis perfusion of the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine (ACh), alone and in combination with NO synthase inhibition [<i>N</i><sup>G</sup>-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)] or ROS scavenging (apocynin). Serum salicylate concentrations following treatment were not different between groups (22.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4 HAs vs. 20.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3 mg/dL MDD; <i>P</i> = 0.46). When compared with HAs, the NO-dependent component of ACh-induced dilation was blunted in adults with MDD before (<i>P</i> = 0.023), but not after (<i>P</i> = 0.27), salsalate treatment. In adults with MDD, the magnitude of improvement in endothelium-dependent dilation following salsalate treatment was inversely related to the degree of functional impairment at baseline (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.43; <i>P</i> = 0.025). Localized ROS scavenging improved NO-dependent dilation before (<i>P</i> < 0.01), but not after (<i>P</i> > 0.05), salsalate treatment. Salsalate did not alter systemic concentrations of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). These data suggest that NF-\u03baB activation, via increased vascular ROS production, contributes to blunted NO-dependent dilation in young adults with MDD but otherwise free of clinical disease. These data provide the first direct evidence for a mechanistic role of vascular inflammation-associated endothelial dysfunction in human depression.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Our data indicate that short-term treatment with therapeutic doses of the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) inhibitor salsalate improved nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). In adults with MDD, acute localized scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with apocynin improved NO-dependent dilation before, but not after, salsalate administration. These data suggest that activation of NF-\u03baB, in part via stimulation of vascular ROS production, contributes to blunted NO-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation in young adults with MDD.",

        "abstract": "Mood disorders are highly prevalent and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression remain poorly understood, although theories regarding dysfunction within various neurotransmitter systems have been postulated. Over 50 years ago, clinical studies suggested that increases in central acetylcholine could lead to depressed mood. Evidence has continued to accumulate suggesting that the cholinergic system has a important role in mood regulation. In particular, the finding that the antimuscarinic agent, scopolamine, exerts fast-onset and sustained antidepressant effects in depressed humans has led to a renewal of interest in the cholinergic system as an important player in the neurochemistry of major depression and bipolar disorder. Here, we synthesize current knowledge regarding the modulation of mood by the central cholinergic system, drawing upon studies from human postmortem brain, neuroimaging, and drug challenge investigations, as well as animal model studies. First, we describe an illustrative series of early discoveries which suggest a role for acetylcholine in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Then, we discuss more recent studies conducted in humans and/or animals which have identified roles for both acetylcholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in different mood states, and as targets for novel therapies.",

        "abstract": "Depression is extremely harmful to modern society. Despite its complex spectrum of symptoms, previous studies have mostly focused on the monaminergic system in search of pharmacological targets. However, other neurotransmitter systems have also been linked to the pathophysiology of depression. In this study, we provide evidence for a role of the cholinergic system in depressive-like behavior of female mice. We evaluated mice knockdown for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT KD mice), which have been previously shown to exhibit reduced cholinergic transmission. Animals were subjected to the tail suspension and marble burying tests, classical paradigms to assess depressive-like behaviors and to screen for novel antidepressant drugs. In addition, brain levels of serotonin and dopamine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. We found that female homozygous VAChT KD mice spent less time immobile during tail suspension and buried less marbles, indicating a less depressive phenotype. These differences in behavior were reverted by central, but not peripheral, acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Moreover, female homozygous VAChT KD mice exhibited higher levels of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum, and increased dopamine in the hippocampus. Our study thus shows a connection between depressive-like behaviors and the cholinergic system, and that the latter interacts with the monoaminergic system.",

Oral administration of a single dose of E2508 (3 or 10mg/kg), but not fluoxetine (30mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), significantly shortened immobility time in rats in the forced swim test. E2508 (10, 30, or 100mg/kg) also showed an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test in mice, with no sedative or muscle relaxant effects for doses up to 100mg/kg. Moreover, E2508 (5 or 20mg/kg) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in the rat defensive burying test. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, also showed an anxiolytic effect in the defensive burying test at the same dose that induced a muscle relaxant effect in mice. Administration of E2508 (30mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days did not affect sexual behavior. By contrast, fluoxetine (30mg/kg) administration for \u22657 consecutive days decreased sexual behavior. These results indicate that E2508 has both potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models, and is well tolerated compared with a commonly prescribed therapeutic SSRI or benzodiazepine.",

We have examined the effects of OBX on behavior and the parameters of the cholinergic system in female rats and mice. In rats, OBX resulted in the appearance of some depressive-like behavioral marks, such as the decreased sucrose consumption, hyperactivity, impaired short-term memory and anxiety-like behavioral features, such as shortened presence in the center of the open field arena or open arms of the elevated plus-maze and an enhancement of avoidance behavior. These behavioral abnormalities could be associated with disturbances in hippocampal function, this suggestion being supported by the presence of cellular changes in this brain structure. No effect of OBX on the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band as well as on the acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity in the septum, hippocampus, and neocortex could be detected. In contrast, in mice, OBX impaired spontaneous alternation behavior and decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band. These data demonstrate that rats and mice differently respond to OBX, in particular, OBX does not significantly affect the cholinergic system in rats.",

Cholinergic activity in the VTA has been demonstrated to regulate phasic DA activity, but the role of VTA cholinergic mechanisms in depression-related behavior is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine whether pharmacological manipulation of VTA cholinergic activity altered behavioral responding in the forced swim test (FST) in rats. Here, male Sprague-Dawley rats received systemic or VTA-specific administration of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (systemic; 0.06 or 0.125mg/kg, intra-cranial; 1 or 2\u03bcg/side), the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antagonist scopolamine (2.4 or 24\u03bcg/side), or the nicotinic AChR antagonist mecamylamine (3 or 30\u03bcg/side), prior to the FST test session. In control experiments, locomotor activity was also examined following systemic and intra-cranial administration of cholinergic drugs. Physostigmine administration, either systemically or directly into the VTA, significantly increased immobility time in FST, whereas physostigmine infusion into a dorsal control site did not alter immobility time. In contrast, VTA infusion of either scopolamine or mecamylamine decreased immobility time, consistent with an antidepressant-like effect. Finally, the VTA physostigmine-induced increase in immobility was blocked by co-administration with scopolamine, but unaltered by co-administration with mecamylamine. These data show that enhancing VTA cholinergic tone and blocking VTA AChRs has opposing effects in FST. Together, the findings provide evidence for a role of VTA cholinergic mechanisms in behavioral responses in FST.",

        "abstract": "Treatment response in late-life depression has been linked to cerebrovascular disease notably via the vascular depression hypothesis. This study investigated the relationship between endothelial function and atherosclerosis and treatment response to antidepressant monotherapy. Twenty five patients with late-life depression were compared with 21 non-depressed control subjects in a case control study. Nine of the depressed subjects were responders to antidepressant monotherapy and 16 were not. Vascular measures included assessment of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) representing atherosclerosis and biopsied small artery dilatation to acetylcholine to assess endothelial function in a subset of subjects. There were no group differences in vascular risks or sociodemographic variables. There was a significant group difference (responders versus non-responders versus controls) on both IMT and endothelial function (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) with a significant difference between controls and non-responders (p\u2009<\u20090.001) on IMT and between controls and responders (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and control versus non-responders (p\u2009<\u20090.05) on endothelial function but no significant difference between responders and non-responders. On both IMT and endothelial function, there was a gradient across groups, with control subjects having best vascular structure or function, non-responders worse and responders in-between. The results are consistent with a hypothesis that poorer antidepressant response in later life depressive disorder may be linked to an underlying vascular dysfunction and pathology. The study is small, and the results require replication but if confirmed, trials with vasoprotective medication aimed at improving vascular function in order to alter the prognosis of late-life depression would be a rational development.",

However, the exact mechanism by which depression may induce cardiovascular events is unclear. Endothelial dysfunction has been reported as a possible link between depression and subsequent cardiovascular events as described in depressed subjects. The purpose of this study was to investigate endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis formation in the aorta of mice exposed to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) procedure. BALB/c mice were exposed to two 7-week UCMS procedures separated by 6 weeks. Treatments (fluoxetine 10 mg/kg; NaCl 0.9%) started at the third week until the end of the seventh week of each procedure. Endothelial function was evaluated by in vitro assessment of acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in aortic rings. By using specific inhibitors for nitric oxide (NO)- and prostacyclin-dependent relaxation, we assessed the part played by NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-like mediators in endothelium-dependent relaxation. Atherosclerosis was evaluated by histological examination. Depression-like behavior was increased in the UCMS versus unstressed group and was reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatment. Vascular reactivity study indicated that UCMS induced a decrease in the NO-dependent relaxation that was partially compensated by an EDHF-like dependent relaxation. Because fluoxetine per se increased the NO-dependent relaxation, fluoxetine was able to reverse UCMS effect on the NO component and abolished the EDHF-like component. Atherosclerotic lesion was found in aorta of UCMS and nonstressed animals. As an independent risk factor, UCMS reproduced the endothelial alterations observed in depression but was not sufficient to provoke morphological alterations.",

The aims of the present study are to examine whether depression is accompanied by autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are formed following O&NS damage; and b) the major anchorage molecules, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. We examined serum IgM antibodies to the conjugated fatty acids, palmitic and myristic acids; acetylcholine; S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and NO-modified adducts in 26 depressed patients and 17 normal controls. Severity of depression was measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and severity of fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale. The prevalences and mean values for the serum IgM levels directed against conjugated palmitic and myristic acids, acetylcholine, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and the conjugated NO adducts, NO-tyrosine, NO-phenylalanine, NO-aspartate, NO-histidine, and NO-creatine were significantly higher in depressed patients than in normal controls. The autoimmune responses were significantly related to FF symptoms, such as fatigue and a flu-like malaise, whereas the indicants of nitrosative stress were related to gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. Depression is characterized by IgM-related autoimmune responses directed against a) neoepitopes that are normally not detected by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i.e. palmitic and myristic acids, and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. These autoimmune responses play a role in the inflammatory and O&NS pathophysiology of depression and may mediate the cellular dysfunctions that contribute to neuroprogression, e.g. aberrations in signal transduction, cellular differentiation and apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "There is a well-established connection between smoking and depression. Depressed individuals are over-represented among smokers, and ex-smokers often experience increased depressive symptoms immediately after stopping smoking. Nicotine in tobacco binds, activates and desensitizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), but it is not known whether activation or desensitization is more important for the effects of nicotine on depressive symptoms. Here we review, based on clinical and preclinical studies of nicotinic drugs, the hypothesis that blockade (rather than activation) of neuronal nAChRs might be important for the effects of nicotinic agents on depressive symptoms. The endogenous neurotransmitter for nAChRs is acetylcholine, and the effects of nicotine on depression-like behaviors support the idea that dysregulation of the cholinergic system might contribute to the etiology of major depressive disorder. Thus, pharmacological agents that limit acetylcholine signaling through neuronal nAChRs might be promising for the development of novel antidepressant medications.",

There were similar cardiovascular profiles between the 2 groups. All of the participants underwent MRI brain scans and subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy from which small arteries were isolated and studied using pressure myography. Cerebral microvascular damage in depressed patients was confirmed by assessment of basal ganglia Virchow-Robin space scores (depressed patients 3.9\u00b11.7 versus controls: 2.5\u00b11.6; P=0.01).

This difference in arterial relaxation was reduced but not entirely eliminated when NO synthase was inhibited. Depressed patients also exhibited hypertrophic wall growth with an increase in medial cross-sectional area (P=0.035, multiple ANOVA and wall thickness; P=0.04, multiple ANOVA).

Initial treatment is often insufficient to achieve full remission in a given depressive episode, resulting in more frequent episodes, worsened severity, and major disability. This review surveys literature on the diagnosis and pharmacological management of TRD in light of recent developments. Evidence regarding commonly used treatment options is critically examined and key recommendations are offered. The review ends by considering drugs acting on the melatonin, acetylcholine, and glutamate systems that hold promise as future options for TRD. Recent trends and research findings have impacted how the evidence supporting different approaches to TRD should be evaluated. For example, many earlier TRD studies employed tricyclics as the primary antidepressant, but tricyclics have now been superseded by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in routine clinical practice. This deficiency has been addressed by the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, the largest effectiveness study of TRD ever conducted. However, design characteristics of the STAR*D study preclude simple comparisons with earlier studies. A shortcoming of most treatment recommendations for TRD is their reliance on older studies that do not reflect the current preeminence of SSRIs in clinical practice. This has distorted the prioritization of pharmacological strategies for TRD. Efforts to correct this distortion with effectiveness research, designed to better reflect current practice trends, require critical consideration of the strengths and limitations of this approach.",

There is very strong evidence implicating a dysfunctional muscarinic system in schizophrenia, +with less information available for bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. The translation of this evidence into clinically viable treatments has been disappointing; hampered by problems associated with developing drugs that target the requisite members of the muscarinic family, rather than all of the receptors, which results in unacceptable side-effect profiles. The discovery of additional binding sites, other than the one occupied by acetylcholine, has revitalised research into this aspect of psychopharmacology. New compounds are now being developed that have the potential to selectively target individual muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system. The question that remains to be answered is whether stimulating central muscarinic receptors will result in the reestablishment of normal central muscarinic activity?

The diagnosis of MDD relies on a cumulative measure derived from multiple trait dimensions and alone is limited in elucidating MDD genetic determinants. We and others have proposed that MDD may be better dissected using paradigms that assess how specific genes associate with component features of MDD. This within-disease design requires both a well-phenotyped cohort and a robust statistical approach that retains power with multiple tests of genetic association. In the present study, common polymorphic variants of genes related to central monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways that previous studies align with functional change in vitro or depression associations in vivo were genotyped in 110 individuals with unipolar MDD. Subphenotypic characteristics were examined using responses to individual items assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the NEO Five Factor Inventory. Multivariate Permutation Testing (MPT) was used to infer genotype-phenotype relationships underlying dimensional findings within clinical categories. MPT analyses show significant associations of the norepinephrine transporter (NET, SLC6A2) -182 T/C (rs2242446) with recurrent depression [odds ratio, OR = 4.15 (1.91-9.02)], NET -3081 A/T (rs28386840) with increase in appetite [OR = 3.58 (1.53-8.39)] and the presynaptic choline transporter (CHT, SLC5A7) Ile89Val (rs1013940) with HAM-D-17 total score {i.e. overall depression severity [OR = 2.74 (1.05-7.18)]}.

        "abstract": "The study builds on the propositions introduced in a companion paper on the neuropharmacology of cognition and its relation to key findings in psychiatry. Cognitive inhibition is often invoked to explain performance in psychiatric illness. Yet it remains only a general conceptual model of executive dysfunction. Premotor theory proposes both neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological equivalents of conscious and unconscious processes. The interaction between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission is stated to have an inverse effect on these two fundamental psychological processes. If one conceives of cognitive inhibition as a failure to voluntarily suppress unconscious prepotent responses, then a deficit in monoaminergic antagonism of cholinergic facilitated prepotent responses accounts for the observed behavioural phenotypes. The plasticity of behaviour is further hypothesized to have an equivalent in intracellular signalling leading to plastic changes in neural networks. Apart from inhibition of prepotent responses it permits the formulation of new behavioural phenotypes. At the receptor level Gi-Gq/11 transduction coupling is proposed to mediate this effect. A hypofunctioning monoaminergic system is thought to underlie the clinical pictures of major depression and ADHD. The neurocognitive deficits of depression include memory loss, poor concentration and rumination. ADHD is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Both these syndromes effectively respond to raising serotonin and dopamine levels, respectively. The core symptoms can usefully be attributed to an imbalance between the neuromodulatory effects of monoamines and ACh. Taking the model of monoaminergic-muscarinic receptor interactions presented previously and extended here, a new hypothesis is proposed for the core symptoms of ADHD. Accordingly, impulsivity and hyperactivity result from impaired dopaminergic inhibition and remodelling of muscarinic mediated prepotent responses. The model also predicts memory impairment in major depression by proposing that low serotonin levels in the neocortex is linked to focal hippocampal dysfunction. Hippocampal theta is proposed to trigger phasic monoaminergic activation involved in encoding of cortical traces and plasticity of propotent networks. It proposes a hypothesis for the enhancement of mood and behaviour induced by antidepressants is partly a response to plasticity of neural networks, that is, remodelling of cholinergic-mediated negative habitual behaviours.",

The primary outcome parameter was [(18)F]FP-TZTP distribution volume, which is proportional to the product of receptor density and affinity and, in the case of [(18)F]FP-TZTP, is known to be sensitive to endogenous acetylcholine concentrations. The relationship between illness severity, as rated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating scales, and distribution volume also was assessed. The mean anterior cingulate cortex distribution volume differed across groups (F55 = 3.4; P = .04), and this difference was accounted for by significantly lower binding in bipolar disorder compared with both major depressive disorder and control groups. The mean M2 receptor binding in subjects with bipolar disorder was reduced relative to both healthy controls and subjects with major depressive disorder, to an extent that correlated with depressive symptoms. The reduction in the bipolar disorder group could be accounted for either by a reduction in M2 receptor density or affinity or an elevation in endogenous acetylcholine levels. To our knowledge, these data provide the first direct evidence that altered M2 receptor function contributes to mood dysregulation in bipolar disorder.",

        "title": "Physiologic mechanisms underlying the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.",
        "abstract": "The rate at which serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment is terminated and the duration of treatment appear to be key factors in predicting discontinuation symptoms. The development of animal models to explain the mechanisms of this clinical problem has proved challenging, because less than half of all patients experience any discontinuation symptoms, many of which are subjective in nature. One explanation is that SRI discontinuation symptoms may arise from the rapid decrease in serotonin (5-HT) availability when treatment ends abruptly. Yet, it would appear that discontinuation discomforts may not be mediated exclusively through 5-HT receptors, given the major regulatory role 5-HT exerts on a number of specific chemical receptor systems in the brain. As a result, attempts to explain the determinants of this phenomenon rely on a certain level of speculation. This article examines the possible physiologic bases for the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome and briefly describes these adaptations. It discusses the 3 systems most likely to account for at least part of the symptomatology--the 5-HT, the norepinephrine, and the cholinergic systems--and the possible interactions among them. It also attempts to explain their implications in the therapeutic actions of antidepressants in patients with affective and anxiety disorders.",

        "title": "Factors associated with complex visual hallucinations during antidepressant treatment.",
        "abstract": "Published case reports on complex visual hallucinations (CVH) occurring during antidepressant (AD) treatment were reviewed. Thirteen cases of CVH associated with SSRI treatment, 16 cases during tricyclic drug treatment and seven cases with other AD drug treatments were found. Nine patients were taking concomitant drugs while on therapy with SSRIs and four had a neurological disease in addition to depression. The cholinergic impoverishment occurring in dementia states or during concomitant therapy with anticholinergic drugs could increase the sensitivity to serotonergic agonists, triggering the manifestation of CVH. During tricyclic drug treatment, half of the reports were of hypnopompic or hypnagogic hallucinations and this can be associated with the effects of tricyclics (TCA) on sleep architecture. It is likely that the potent anticholinergic effect of amitriptyline was potentiated in a situation of a rapidly changing state of consciousness. In general, the review supports the view that an imbalance between serotonin and acetylcholine systems is at the root of AD-induced CVH, with a profile defined by a cholinergic hypoactivity and a serotonergic hyperactivity. Caution is needed when administering a combination of serotonergic and anticholinergic AD in the treatment of the demented population and in other already compromised patients because there is a risk of precipitating CVH.",

        "title": "Sleep-wake effects of yohimbine and atropine in rats with a clomipramine-based model of depression.",
        "abstract": "The present study examined the sleep-wake cycle effects of microinjections of yohimbine, an adrenergic antagonist, and atropine, a cholinergic antagonist, into the cerebral ventricle of clomipramine-induced depressed rats. Yohimbine microinjection caused a significant reduction in the total duration and the number of REM sleep episodes compared to control saline injections. Atropine microinjection caused a significant reduction in the total duration and the number of REM sleep episodes without changing the REM sleep latency compared to control saline microinjection. These results show for the first time that the REM sleep disturbances observed in clomipramine-treatment induced depressed rats can be attenuated by increasing and decreasing the brain noradrenergic and cholinergic activities, respectively.",

        "title": "Contribution of sleep physiology to depressive pathophysiology.",
        "abstract": "Among the best characterized neurobiological changes in mood disorders are specific alterations in electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep, including disinhibited rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and suppressed slow wave sleep. A strong link between mood disorders and sleep is that depressive symptoms are alleviated by one night of sleep deprivation and reoccur after sleeping. Sleep underlies homeostatic and circadian mechanisms that interact in complex ways. These relationships have been formalized in electrophysiological, neurochemical and neuroendocrinological models that extend to the pathophysiology of affective illness. Sleep research as a pathophysiological window to the brain has contributed extensively to the understanding of the neurobiology of depression and has been a substantial guide for the advancement of model-driven clinical and preclinical research. Pharmacological probes of normal and depressed sleep play an important role. It is anticipated that the combination of novel topographical EEG and neuroimaging techniques with traditional experimental methods will provide us with further insight into the neurobiology of sleep and depression.",

        "abstract": "Some studies have suggested that noradrenergic activity may decrease with age in depressed patients. Pupil size is regulated by a balance between norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The present study compares pupil size in 10 unmedicated patients with unipolar depression (296. 3) and in 16 normal controls. Pupil size after dilation with tropicamide, a cholinergic antagonist, was inversely related to age in the patients (r=-0.87), but did not diminish with age in controls. The results suggest that pupil size may provide an index of diminished noradrenergic function with age in patients with major depression.",

        "abstract": "Depression raises numerous questions that are pathophysiological, diagnostic and epidemiological as well as therapeutic. Amongst those questions, antidepressant drugs and their action mechanism(s) remain the subject of many studies in all fields, with a view to enhanced management of patients suffering from mood disorders. Numerous hypotheses both neurobiological and pharmacological have been advanced with respect to the neurochemical mechanisms involved in depressive disease and the neurobiological impact of antidepressants. In addition to the aminergic hypotheses which are currently the best supported, numerous arguments tend to show the value of taking into account the overall function of the brain and no longer only considering a single neuronal system. In this context, the value of a dual specific action on the main two central aminergic systems, the noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems, has now emerged.",
