        "abstract": "The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",

        "abstract": "Panic disorder is more frequent in women than in men. In women, vulnerability to panic is enhanced during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. At this time secretion of progesterone and its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO), which acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the actions of GABA at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, decline sharply. In female rats, responsiveness to a hypoxic panicogenic challenge increases during the late diestrus (LD) phase as ALLO concentration in the brain falls. During LD, short-term treatment with fluoxetine at a low dose (1.75\u00a0mg/kg i.p.) blocked panic-related escape behavior in response to hypoxia. At this dose fluoxetine increases brain concentration of ALLO without affecting 5-HT levels, thereby stabilizing brain ALLO concentration. We here report that the panicolytic-like effect of fluoxetine during LD is prevented by microinjection of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline (5\u00a0pmol) into the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), a key panic-related area. This result suggests that fluoxetine's effect is indirectly mediated via a GABAergic mechanism in the dPAG and highlights the important role of changes in GABAergic tone in regulating neuronal excitability in the panic circuitry during the estrous cycle. It also points to the potential for using short-term, low dose fluoxetine as an anti-panic medication in women.",

        "title": "GABAergic implications in anxiety and related disorders.",
        "abstract": "Evidence indicates that anxiety disorders arise from an imbalance in the functioning of brain circuits that govern the modulation of emotional responses to possibly threatening stimuli. The circuits under consideration in this context include the amygdala's bottom-up activity, which signifies the existence of stimuli that may be seen as dangerous. Moreover, these circuits encompass top-down regulatory processes that originate in the prefrontal cortex, facilitating the communication of the emotional significance associated with the inputs. Diverse databases (e.g., Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar) were searched for literature using a combination of different terms e.g., \"anxiety\", \"stress\", \"neuroanatomy\", and \"neural circuits\", etc. A decrease in GABAergic activity is present in both anxiety disorders and severe depression. Research on cerebral functional imaging in depressive individuals has shown reduced levels of GABA within the cortical regions. Additionally, animal studies demonstrated that a reduction in the expression of GABA<sub>A/B</sub> receptors results in a behavioral pattern resembling anxiety. The amygdala consists of inhibitory networks composed of GABAergic interneurons, responsible for modulating anxiety responses in both normal and pathological conditions. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor has allosteric sites (e.g., \u03b1/\u03b3, \u03b3/\u03b2, and \u03b1/\u03b2) which enable regulation of neuronal inhibition in the amygdala. These sites serve as molecular targets for anxiolytic medications such as benzodiazepine and barbiturates. Alterations in the levels of naturally occurring regulators of these allosteric sites, along with alterations to the composition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, could potentially act as mechanisms via which the extent of neuronal inhibition is diminished in pathological anxiety disorders.",

This study included patients with OCD (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a025) ranging in age from 18 to 65. We used the ELISA method to evaluate serum SOD and GPx levels. Levels of NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr in the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus were measured using the 1H-MRS method. Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3\u00a0T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety-associated symptoms following acute stress usually become extinct gradually within a period of time. However, the mechanisms underlying how individuals cope with stress to achieve the extinction of anxiety are not clear. Here we show that acute restraint stress causes an increase in the activity of GABAergic neurons in the CeA (GABA<sup>CeA</sup>) in male mice, resulting in anxiety-like behaviors within 12\u2009hours; meanwhile, elevated GABA<sup>CeA</sup> neuronal CX3CL1 secretion via MST4 (mammalian sterile-20-like kinase 4)-NF-\u03baB-CX3CL1 signaling consequently activates microglia in the CeA. Activated microglia in turn inhibit GABA<sup>CeA</sup> neuronal activity via the engulfment of their dendritic spines, ultimately leading to the extinction of anxiety-like behaviors induced by restraint stress. These findings reveal a dynamic molecular and cellular mechanism in which microglia drive a negative feedback to inhibit GABA<sup>CeA</sup> neuronal activity, thus facilitating maintenance of brain homeostasis in response to acute stress.",

In total, 54 patients with OCD and 54 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex were included in the study. They underwent MRS in the pgACC region to calculate the concentrations of Glu, Gln, GABA, and Glu + Gln (Glx). After quality control of the MRS data, 21 OCD and 21 HC were statistically analyzed. The severity of symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale. The results indicate that patients with OCD present a disturbance in glutamatergic metabolism in the pgACC.

        "abstract": "Nutritional disturbances during the early postnatal period can have long-lasting effects on neurodevelopment and may be related to behavioural changes at adulthood. While such neuronal connection disruption can contribute to social and behaviour alterations, the dysregulation of the neuroendocrine pathways involved in nutrient-sensing balance may also cause such impairments, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We aimed to evaluate sex-specific neurodevelopmental and behavioural changes upon postnatal overfeeding and determine the potential underpinning mechanisms at the central nervous system level, with a focus on the interconnection between synaptic and neuroendocrine molecular alterations. At postnatal day 3 (PND3) litters were culled to three animals (small litter procedure). Neurodevelopmental tests were conducted at infancy, whereas behavioural tests to assess locomotion, anxiety, and memory were performed at adolescence, together with molecular analysis of the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex. At infancy, females presented impaired acquisition of an auditory response, eye opening, olfactory discrimination, and vestibular system development, suggesting that female offspring neurodevelopment/maturation was deeply affected. Male offspring presented a transitory delay in locomotor performance., while both offspring had lower upper limb strength. At adolescence, both sexes presented anxious-like behaviour without alterations in short-term memory retention. Both males and females presented lower NPY1R levels in a region-specific manner. Furthermore, both sexes presented synaptic changes in the hippocampus (lower GABA<sub>A</sub> in females and higher GABA<sub>A</sub> levels in males), while, in the prefrontal cortex, similar higher GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor levels were observed. At the hypothalamus, females presented synaptic changes, namely higher vGLUT1 and PSD95 levels. Thus, we demonstrate that postnatal overfeeding modulates offspring behaviour and dysregulates nutrient-sensing mechanisms such as NPY and GABA in a sex- and brain-region-specific manner.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety disorders have been linked to a disbalance of excitation and inhibition in a network of brain structures comprising frontal cortical regions, the amygdala and the hippocampus, among others. Recent imaging studies suggest sex differences in the activation of this anxiety network during the processing of emotional information. Rodent models with genetically altered \u03d2-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission allow studying the neuronal basis of such activation shifts and their relation to anxiety endophenotypes, but to date sex effects have rarely been addressed. Using mice with a null mutation of the GABA synthetizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65-/-), we started to compare anxiety-like behavior and avoidance in male vs. female GAD65-/- mice and their wildtype littermates. In an open field, female GAD65-/- mice displayed increased activity, while male GAD65-/- mice showed an increased adaptation of anxiety-like behavior over time. GAD65-/- mice of both sexes had a higher preference for social interaction partners, which was further heightened in male mice. In male mice higher escape responses were observed during an active avoidance task. Together, female mice showed more stable emotional responses despite GAD65 deficiency. To gain insights into interneuron function in network structures controlling anxiety and threat perception, fast oscillations (10-45\u00a0Hz) were measured in ex vivo slice preparations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). GAD65-/- mice of both sexes displayed increased gamma power in the ACC and a higher density of PV-positive interneurons, which are crucial for generating such rhythmic activity. In addition, GAD65-/- mice had lower numbers of somatostatin-positive interneurons in the basolateral amygdala and in the dorsal dentate gyrus especially in male mice, two key regions important for anxiety and active avoidance responses. Our data suggest sex differences in the configuration of GABAergic interneurons in a cortico-amygdala-hippocampal network controlling network activity patterns, anxiety and threat avoidance behavior.",

Current management consists of a range of pharmacological and psychological treatments.

In this review, the authors first discuss the diagnostic criteria and epidemiology of GAD. The effective pharmacological treatments for GAD and their tolerability are addressed. Current consensus guidelines for treatment of GAD are discussed, and maintenance treatment, the management of treatment resistance, and specific management of older adults and children/adolescents are considered. Finally, novel anxiolytics under development are discussed, with a focus on those which have entered clinical trials. A range of effective treatments for GAD are available, particularly duloxetine, escitalopram, pregabalin, quetiapine, and venlafaxine. There is a limited evidence base to support the further pharmacological management of patients with GAD who have not responded to initial treatment. Although many novel anxiolytics have progressed to clinical trials, translation from animal models has been mostly unsuccessful. However, the potential of several compounds including certain psychedelics, ketamine, oxytocin, and agents modulating the orexin, endocannabinoid, and immune systems merits further study.",

This review aimed to summarize data on the efficacy of unlabeled molecules for SAD treatment. Research in the main psychiatric databases was conducted (PubMed, PsychINFO, and EMBASE-Ovid) to select studies investigating the efficacy of marketed molecules not labeled for SAD treatment. Pregabalin at high doses (450-600 mg/day) appears to be a reliable alternative strategy for SAD treatment. Among the SSRIs not labeled for SAD, citalopram showed the most promising results.

Concurrent AUD-AnxD poses a challenge for clinical management as approaches to treatment of one disorder may be ineffective or potentially counterproductive for the other disorder. We present the case of a middle-aged man with anxiety disorder, AUD, chronic pain, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate use in context of tapering prescribed benzodiazepines who experienced severe alcohol withdrawal episodes during a complicated course of repeated inpatient withdrawal management. After medical stabilization, the patient found significant improvement in symptoms and no return to alcohol use with a regimen of naltrexone targeting his AUD, gabapentin targeting both his AUD and AnxD, and engagement with integrated psychotherapy, Alcoholics Anonymous, and addictions medicine follow-up. Proper recognition and interventions for AUD and AnxD, ideally with overlapping efficacy, can benefit individuals with comorbid AUD-AnxD. Gabapentin, tobacco cessation, and integrated psychotherapy have preliminary evidence of synergistic effects in AUD-AnxD. Meta-analysis evidence does not support serotoninergic medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) which are commonly prescribed in AnxD and mood disorders as their use has not been associated with improved outcomes for AUD-AnxD. Additionally, several double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials have suggested that serotonergic medications may worsen alcohol-related outcomes in some individuals with AUD.

        "abstract": "Neonatal inflammation can increase the risk of anxiety disorder in adulthood. The balance between glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory transmissions in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a vital role in controlling anxiety state. Based on the reports that early-life inflammation had adverse effects on GABAergic system, the aim of this study was to investigate whether and how neonatal inflammation affects excitatory-inhibitory circuits in the BLA resulting in anxiety disorder. Neonatal mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) or saline on postnatal days 3-5. LPS-treated mice developed anxiety behaviors accompanied by the hyperactivity of adrenal axis in adulthood. Electrophysiological study revealed the increase of postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the cortical-BLA excitatory synapses of LPS mice which could be recovered by bath-application of GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist suggesting the impairment of GABAergic system in LPS mice. Compared with controls, GABA<sub>A</sub>R\u03b12 subunit expression and density of GABA-evoked current in BLA principal neurons were reduced in LPS mice. Additionally, neonatal LPS treatment resulted in the down-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) expression and PKC signaling pathway in the adult BLA. The local TGF-\u03b21 overexpression in the BLA improved GABA<sub>A</sub>R\u03b12 expression via up-regulating the activity of PKC signaling, which corrected GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibition leading to the abolishment of anxiety-like change in adrenal axis regulation and behaviors in LPS mice. These data suggest the persistent TGF-\u03b21deficit induces the down-regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R\u03b12 expression and subsequent disruption of the excitation-inhibition balance in the BLA circuits, which is the important mechanisms of neonatal inflammation-induced anxiety disorder.",

Although many treatment options are available, they are often associated with unacceptable side-effect profiles and approximately one in three patients are treatment resistant. Allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid acting as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, is synthesised in response to stress and acts to negatively modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. After chronic exposure to and withdrawal from allopregnanolone, an increase in \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors results in a reduced inhibitory effect of allopregnanolone, resulting in decreased inhibition and, therefore, increased neuronal excitability. The relationship between allopregnanolone and increased \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has been demonstrated in animal models during methamphetamine withdrawal and puberty, events both associated with stress. The effect of allopregnanolone during these events is anxiogenic, a paradoxical action to its usual anxiolytic effects. Flumazenil, the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, has been shown to cause receptor internalisation of \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which may results in anxiolysis. We propose that chronic stress and chronic exposure to and withdrawal from allopregnanolone in anxiety disorders result in alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function, which can be corrected by flumazenil. As such, flumazenil may exhibit anxiolytic properties in patients with increased \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression.",

Mice were divided into two groups: a normal control group treated with 0.9% saline (10\u202fml/kg, i.p.), and a kainate group treated with kainate (10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.). All mice that developed status epilepticus were individually observed for spontaneous seizures. Eighteen days after the induction of status epilepticus, mice that exhibited spontaneous seizures were further divided into 6 groups of 7 mice each and treated as follows: a kainate group treated with 0.9% saline (10\u202fml/kg, p.o.), two positive control groups either treated with sodium valproate (300\u202fmg/kg, p.o.) or with piracetam (200\u202fmg/kg, p.o.), and three test groups received the extract (230, 460, and 917\u202fmg/kg, p.o.). The control group was treated with 0.9% saline (10\u202fml/kg, p.o.). These treatments lasted 14\u202fdays and the animals were observed 6\u202fh per day for behavioral seizures. Subsequently, the animals were evaluated for anxiety disorders and memory impairment. Animals were then sacrificed and the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex was collected for histological and biochemical analyses. Furthermore, the dilacerates of the hippocampi were stored for white blood cell count. The aqueous extract of L. camara (460\u202fmg/kg) remarkably decreased (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) the number and duration of seizures compared to sodium valproate. Also, it significantly increased the level of GABA both in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and protected these organs from oxidative stress. Furthermore, the extract (230\u202fmg/kg) induced the highest reduction in the number of white blood cells in the hippocampus. Finally, the extract (917\u202fmg/kg) significantly attenuated neuronal loss in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. All these compared to the negative control. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of L. camara has an antiepileptic-like effect comparable to that of sodium valproate. This, therefore, warrants further investigation into the effect of bioactive molecules present in the extract using in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy.",

The management of pregabalin use disorder is challenging due to the risks associated with the abrupt withdrawal and lack of guidelines. In this retrospective observational study, the management of pregabalin use disorder was analyzed in eight cases reported to the addictovigilance center of Montpellier, France, between 2019 and 2020. Most of these patients had a history of illicit psychoactive substance use. During the withdrawal period, patients experienced mainly psychiatric problems, nervous system symptoms, general disorders, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Multiple strategies were proposed for these patients to manage pregabalin withdrawal, such as hospitalization and pregabalin gradual dose reduction with or without adjuvant medications. Two patients relapsed and the others were lost to follow up. Although other reports of pregabalin use disorder have been published, recommendations or guidelines for its management are not yet available.

Prior reports on pregabalin withdrawal have mainly focused on cases with pregabalin dependence or abuse, and little attention has been paid to patients who are prescribed regular doses of pregabalin. Herein, we report three cases of pregabalin withdrawal in patients without psychiatric disorders, taking regular doses of pregabalin, who developed psychiatric symptoms such as insomnia and anxiety after abrupt discontinuation of pregabalin. In addition, we conducted a systematic review of six case reports (previous studies) of pregabalin withdrawal under regular doses of pregabalin. Among the six cases, three patients had no comorbid mental or substance use disorders, the dose of pregabalin ranged from 150 to 600\u00a0mg/d, and the duration of pregabalin use ranged from a few weeks to many years. Of these six cases of pregabalin withdrawal, five had psychopathological symptoms, three had vegetative symptoms, and three had neurologic and physical complications. We concluded that since pregabalin withdrawal can occur even with regular doses and short-term use, clinicians must carefully reduce pregabalin doses when reducing or discontinuing treatment, paying close attention to withdrawal symptoms. Our case series sheds light on the scant evidence from previous research on physical dependence in patients who are taking regular doses of pregabalin.

        "title": "Increasing the dosage of pregabalin in patients with focal epilepsy decreases the frequency of seizures and ameliorates symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia.",
        "abstract": "The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the adequate dosage of medications. In clinical practice, drugs are often used at doses that are too low, which results in suboptimal levels of clinical improvement. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of increasing the dose of previously taken pregabalin in a group of patients with focal epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This open study involved 993 patients (46 \u00b1 14 years old) suffering from epilepsy with focal seizures and concomitant GAD treated with pregabalin add-on therapy. The severity of anxiety was assessed with GAD-7 Scale. The number of epileptic seizures was monitored before and after the increase of the pregabalin dose. On the initial visit, the mean daily dose of pregabalin was 159 \u00b1 82 mg. During the study period (nine months) the mean dose was increased to 327 \u00b1 163 mg. After nine months, based on the intention-to-treat analysis, 27.1% (N = 253) of the subjects experienced seizure resolution, and 57.8% (N = 539) reduction in seizure frequency by at least 50%. At the beginning of the study, despite pregabalin administration, 60.7% of patients were above the diagnostic threshold for GAD diagnosis. The add-on therapy resulted in the improvement of the depressive and anxiety symptoms, and insomnia, greater in those that experienced seizure resolution or reduction in their frequency. (1) Patients with focal epilepsy with concomitant anxiety disorder experience reduction in seizure frequency, improvement of anxiety, depressive symptoms and insomnia using PGB as an add-on therapy. (2) Our data suggest that pregabalin as an add-on treatment is a reasonable choice for patients with focal epilepsy who have concomitant symptoms of an anxiety disorder.",

        "title": "The characterization of psychotic symptoms in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency: a review.",
        "abstract": "Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is an ultra-rare inborn error of metabolism that results in disrupted gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) catabolism. In addition to developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, and seizures, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur, including psychosis. By highlighting all available and relevant case reports/series, this qualitative review seeks to characterize the prevalence, clinical manifestation, pathophysiology, and treatment of psychotic symptoms in this population. Psychosis occurs in a minority of SSADH-deficient individuals, and most commonly presents as auditory or visual hallucinations with an onset in adolescence or young adulthood. Although the pathophysiology underlying the development of psychosis in this context is not fully understood, it likely in part relates to increased GABA and/or gamma hydroxybutyric acid activity. Although antipsychotic medications should be used cautiously in SSADH deficiency, they may be effective at treating emergent psychotic symptoms.",

        "title": "Awake Bruxism Treated with Pregabaline in a Patient with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.",
        "abstract": "Bruxism is excessive teeth grinding or jaw clenching. Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations. There are two types of bruxism, awake bruxism and sleep bruxism. Awake bruxism is generally treated by dentists and maxilla-facial surgeons through several treatment modalities such as, counselling about triggers, relaxation, occlusal splints and botulinum toxin type A injections. We will present the case of a 21-year-old woman presenting mood swings with a high level of anxiety and concentration difficulties since childhood. She also complained of awake bruxism. Intelligence was evaluated using The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was investigated through a neuropsychology test. Intelligence evaluation showed normal intellectual function. Neuropsychology test showed a profile corresponding to ADHD. Bupropion XR 300 mg was initiated for ADHD. Pregabalin was prescribed for general anxiety syndrome. The patient reported a complete disappearance of awake bruxism at a daily dose of 375 mg, with no occlusal appliances. Following the improvement of the anxiety symptoms, the attempt to reduce the dose twice leading to the recurrence of bruxism. A 21 years old female treated with 375 mg daily doses of pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder experienced a significant reduction of daytime bruxism. More studies are needed to determine whether pregabalin has a long term effect against awake bruxism.",

        "title": "GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptors: Anxiety and Mood Disorders.",
        "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, acts at the ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, and the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. This chapter summarizes the studies that have investigated the role of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor in stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety and mood disorders. Overall, clinical and preclinical evidences strongly suggest that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor is a therapeutic candidate for depression and anxiety disorders. However, the clinical development of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-based drugs to treat these disorders has been hampered by their potential side-effects, particularly those of agonists. Nevertheless, the discovery of novel GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor allosteric modulators, and increasing understanding of the influence of specific intracellular GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-associated proteins on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activity, may now pave the way towards GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor therapeutics in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.",
