        "title": "Antidepressant efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder and the role of its pharmacodynamic properties: A hypothesis based on data.",
        "abstract": "The treatment of bipolar depression is one of the most challenging needs in contemporary psychiatry. Currently, only quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, lurasidone, cariprazine, and recently lumateperone have been FDA-approved to treat this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain elusive. The current study investigated whether the pharmacodynamic properties of cariprazine fit into a previously developed model which was the first to be derived based on the strict combination of clinical and preclinical data. The authors performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of cariprazine. The original model suggests that a constellation of effects on different receptors is necessary and that serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to play a significant role in acute bipolar depression. On the contrary, norepinephrine activity seems to be necessary. Probably the early antidepressant effect can be achieved through an agonistic activity at 5HT-1A and antagonism at alpha1 noradrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors, but the presence of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibition appears essential to sustain it. Overall, the properties of cariprazine fit well the proposed model and add to its validity. A point that needs further clarification is norepinephrine reuptake inhibition which is not yet fully studied for cariprazine.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of the noradrenergic (NE) neurons is implicated in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BPD). ErbB4 is highly expressed in NE neurons, and its genetic variation has been linked to BPD; however, how ErbB4 regulates NE neuronal function and contributes to BPD pathogenesis is unclear. Here we find that conditional deletion of ErbB4 in locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons increases neuronal spontaneous firing through NMDA receptor hyperfunction, and elevates catecholamines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, <i>Erbb4</i>-deficient mice present mania-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased sucrose preference. These behaviors are completely rescued by the anti-manic drug lithium or antagonists of catecholaminergic receptors. Our study demonstrates the critical role of ErbB4 signaling in regulating LC-NE neuronal function, reinforcing the view that dysfunction of the NE system may contribute to the pathogenesis of mania-associated disorder.",

        "abstract": "A number of neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in contributing to the pathology of mood disorders, including those of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMSD) alters most of the neurotransmitters, which may have adverse behavioural changes and other health consequences like mania and other psychiatric disorders. The exact role of REMSD altered neurotransmitter levels and the manner in which emerging consequences lead to mania-like behaviour is poorly understood. Thus, we sought to verify the levels of neurotransmitter changes after 48, 72 and 96\u00a0h of REMSD induced mania-like behaviour in mice. We performed modified multiple platform (MMP) method of depriving the REM sleep and one group maintained as a control. To measure the hyperactivity through locomotion, exploration and behavioural despair, we performed the Open Field Test (OFT) and the Forced Swim Test (FST). Quantitative determinations of DA, 5-HT, NE and GABA concentrations in four distinct brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and pons) were determined by the spectrofluorimetric method. These experiments showed higher locomotion and increased swimming, struggling/climbing and decreased mobility among REMSD animals as well as disrupted concentrations of the majority of the studied neurotransmitters during REMSD. Our study indicated that REMSD results in mania-like behaviour in mice and associated disruption to neurotransmitter levels, although the exact mechanisms by which these take place remain to be determined.",

        "abstract": "Remission is the primary goal of treatment for bipolar disorder I (BDI). Metabolites of noradrenaline and dopamine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid (HVA), respectively, are reduced by treatment with antipsychotics, but whether these phenomena are caused by antipsychotics or by the pathophysiology of BDI is not known. Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mood disorders have also been suggested. We conducted a multifaceted study in BDI patients to ascertain if biological markers are associated with the manic state. Patients with Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores >20 participated in the study. Final analyses involved 24 BDI patients (13 men and 11 women). We used YMRS scores to identify mania stages in individual BDI patients (i.e., manic syndrome, response and remission stages). Statistical analyses were done using one-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (rep-ANOVA) throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages. Plasma concentrations of MHPG and HVA were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Plasma levels of BDNF were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BDI patients had significantly reduced plasma levels of MHPG throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages (rep-ANOVA, p\u200a=\u200a0.002). Without a case of response state, there was a significant positive correlation between YMRS scores and plasma levels of MHPG (\u03c1\u200a=\u200a0.33, p\u200a=\u200a0.033, n\u200a=\u200a48). Plasma levels of HVA and BDNF were not significantly altered throughout manic syndrome, response and remission stages. These data suggest that the peripheral level of MHPG (which is associated with noradrenaline levels in the brain) could be used as a biomarker for the manic state in BDI. The MHPG level is likely to reflect the clinical characteristics of the manic syndrome in BDI, and noradrenaline may reflect the pathophysiology from manic to remission states.",

        "title": "Is elevated norepinephrine an etiological factor in some cases of Parkinson's disease?",
        "abstract": "It is well documented that norepinephrine (NE) releasing neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus that is a major source of NE for the brain, degenerate during the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). A number of studies also suggest that, as a result, there is less NE released in the brain during disease progression, which may contribute to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. This paper puts forth the novel hypothesis that NE degeneration in PD is preceded by elevated NE signaling, mainly as a result of genetics, and that this elevation is a major etiological factor in the disease. In this scenario, long-term (if not lifelong) elevated NE signaling could eventually invoke compensatory mechanisms that result in noradrenergic, and possibly dopaminergic, cell death. Several lines of evidence are briefly reviewed on the relationship between NE signaling and PD, including studies of: the level of NE; drugs that increase or decrease NE signaling; the relationship between PD and bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, since the latter three conditions may be associated with increased NE signaling; and the relationship between PD and psychological stress, since stress is associated with increased release of NE. Many of these studies support NE degeneration during the disease, although some are consistent with elevated NE signaling during disease progression. Because there are few data on the state of the NE system prior to disease onset, the central point of this paper that NE signaling is elevated prior to development of PD, remains largely hypothetical. If elevated NE signaling really is an etiological factor in this disease, then early identification of susceptible individuals and long-term treatment with NE transmission reducing drugs, may help prevent or slow progression of PD.",

        "abstract": "A number of hypotheses have been put forth regarding the etiology of schizophrenia, including the dopamine hypothesis, NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis, and others. A lesser known theory is that elevated noradrenergic signaling plays a causative role in the disease. This paper briefly re-examines the merits of this hypothesis, including as it relates to some recently published studies. Several lines of evidence are investigated, including: endogenous level studies of norepinephrine (NE); modulation of the disease by noradrenergic drugs; association of the disease with bipolar disorder and hypertension, since these latter two conditions may involve elevated NE transmission; and effects of psychological stress on the disease, since stress can produce elevated release of NE. For many of these lines of evidence, their relationship with prepulse inhibition of startle is examined. A number of these studies support the hypothesis, and several suggest that elevated NE signaling plays a particularly prominent role in the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia. If the hypothesis is correct for some persons, conventional pharmaceutical treatment options, such as use of atypical antipsychotics (which may themselves modulate noradrenergic signaling), may be improved if selective NE transmission modulating agents are added to or even substituted for these conventional drugs.",

In the present paper, we review and meta-analyze available data about the short-term and long-term efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder or bipolar depression. A literature research was carried out using three electronic databases. Studies providing measures of efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine, either as monotherapy or as augmentation, for bipolar depression were considered. Seven short-term studies and four maintenance studies were included. Short-term studies suggested that patients treated with quetiapine monotherapy were significantly more likely than patients treated with placebo and further active comparators to achieve higher response and remission rates as well as more clinical improvements at the endpoint. Such benefits were significant from the first weeks of treatment onward. Maintenance studies suggested that the combination of quetiapine and mood stabilizers was significantly better than placebo plus mood stabilizers for the prevention of both depressive and manic relapses. Quetiapine was generally well tolerated. Furthermore, several clinical variables moderated outcomes under investigation. In conclusion, quetiapine could have some advantages over traditional treatments for the treatment of bipolar depression.",

The key biogenic amines in the aminergic system include serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh).

Evidence from select studies of cerebrospinal fluid, postmortem subjects, neuroimaging, genetic factors, and pharmacological agents will be used to reconcile these hypotheses. Possible explanations for discrepancies in these hypotheses are given, and directions for future studies are suggested.",

However, NE may also have proconvulsant properties under some conditions, both in animal epilepsy models and in humans. This paper examines the hypothesis that this neurotransmitter has proconvulsant properties, where much of the pharmaceutical evidence comes from rodent models. In assessing the elevated NE epilepsy hypothesis, the following seven lines of evidence are examined that include studies of: (1) antidepressants that raise the level of NE; (2) clonidine and other alpha 2 adrenergic agonist drugs that lower the level of NE; (3) prazosin and other drugs that affect alpha adrenoceptors; (4) propranolol and other drugs that affect beta adrenoceptors; (5) pheochromocytoma, which is a rare cancer of the adrenal glands that can boost NE levels; (6) comorbidity of epilepsy with bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, where all four conditions may involve elevated NE; and (7) psychological stress, which is associated with increased release of NE. The body of evidence supporting the NE proconvulsant hypothesis is consistent with the notion that elevated, endogenous noradrenergic transmission is an etiological factor in some cases of epilepsy.",

        "abstract": "Impulsivity, a breakdown in the balance between initiation and screening of action that leads to reactions to stimuli without adequate reflection or regard for consequences, is a core feature of bipolar disorder and is prominent in manic episodes. Catecholaminergic function is related to impulsivity and mania. Manic individuals have abnormal dopaminergic reactions to reward and abnormal responses in the ventral prefrontal cortex that are consistent with impulsive behavior. Impulsivity in mania is pervasive, encompassing deficits in attention and behavioral inhibition. Impulsivity is increased with severe course of illness (eg, frequent episodes, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts). In mixed states, mania-associated impulsivity combines with depressive symptoms to increase the risk of suicide. Clinical management of impulsivity in mania involves addressing interpersonal distortions inherent in mania; reducing overstimulation; alertness to medical-, trauma-, or substance-related problems; and prompt pharmacologic treatment. Manic episodes must be viewed in the context of the life course of bipolar disorder.",

        "abstract": "Atypical antipsychotics are now widely used in the acute and long-term treatment in bipolar disorder. The role of atypical antipsychotics as acute agents, add-on medications; or as primary mood stabilizers in different phases of bipolar disorder is an important current research tendency. However, in bipolar disorder the mostly used indication of quetiapine is the management of acute manic phases, clinical data and the actual research results suggest that it may have both antidepressant and long-term antimanic effects. Quetiapine enhances the transmission of the central serotonergic networks, by its high antagonistic affinity for 5-HT(2A) and partial agonistic activity for the 5-HT(1A) receptors. The 5HT(1A) partial agonism causes an increase in the dopaminergic neurotransmission of the prefrontal cortex, and also, the affinity for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor brings a relative increase in extracellular noradrenergic release an tone in the prefrontal cortex. Latest research shows that quetiapine's main, active, human plasma metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine (norquetiapine), has a high inhibition affinity for the noradrenergic transporter. These data suggest that comparing to other atypical antipsychotics, norquetiapine may have a relatively strong antidepressant potential. Modifying the dopaminergic transmission by quetiapine's D2 receptor blocking activity results indirect mediating the cAMP-PKA and the arrestin-Akt-GSK-3 intracellular signal transduction pathways, which process may explain its long-term antimanic and mood stabilizing capability. Quetiapine's activity on nerve growth factors, histamine H1 receptor, proinflammatory networks may take an important additional part in its efficacy in bipolar depression. Its very fast dissociation from the D2 receptor is an important pharmakokinetic parameter for managing the optimal quetiapine dose in the daily clinical practice. This review tries to organize the actual information on quetiapine's multiplex activity in bipolar disorder.",

We examined 5-HT input and NE neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC, the NE nucleus that innervates the forebrain) in BD by quantifying immunoreactivity (IR) for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the biosynthetic enzymes for NE and 5-HT, respectively. Six suicides with BD were compared to matched normal controls and unipolar major depression suicides, using immunocytochemistry with computer-assisted quantification of immunoreactivity. Depressed bipolar suicides had 26.7 +/- 1.3% of LC area occupied by the TH immunoreactive (TH-IR) process, while controls had 50.7 +/- 8% (p = 0.002) and unipolar depressed suicides had 50.3 +/- 2.5% (p = 0.003). In bipolars, these processes did not stain as darkly (1.9 +/- 0.5 x background) as controls (2.9 +/- 0.9 x background; p = 0.01) or unipolars (2.9 +/- 0.6 x background; p = 0.002).

The TPH-IR intensity did not differ between groups. We found less TH-IR and TPH-IR in the LC in depressed bipolar suicides, but not unipolar suicides, suggesting that both NE and 5-HT activity is lower in BD.

Recent studies suggest alterations in neuroplasticity and cellular resiliency may be more closely related to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorders, as well as the mechanism of action related to effective treatments. Patients with mood disorders have been found to exhibit evidence of neuroplastic changes, such as reductions in hippocampal and cortical volume, glial and neuronal cell density, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor; chronic stress, a major precipitator of depression, has been shown to cause many of the same neuroplastic changes to occur in animal models.

There is strong neurobiological evidence showing that serotonergic and noradrenergic dysfunction is implicated in suicidal behaviours. We will apply now a new family based association strategy aimed to explain the genetic influence in suicidal behaviour by power based association test statistics (PBAT) in 336 bipolar patients assessed for suicidality within nuclear families. By use of conditional power calculations, the approach screens all possible null hypotheses without biasing the nominal significance level, and it identifies the subset of phenotypes that has optimal power when tested for association by either univariate or multivariate family based association test (FBAT). Using this statistical approach (PBAT) we investigated polymorphisms in serotonergic and noradrenergic genes, considering suicidal behaviour severity instead of the dichotomous phenotype (presence of suicide attempt). COMT Val/Met polymorphism was not associated with suicide with high confidence (power=91%). On the other hand, the analysis of the other 12 markers in the adrenergic and serotonergic genes revealed that the TH allele tended towards association with higher severity of suicidal behaviour (p=0.060) but the power obtained was very low. The marginal finding of association between TH and severe suicidal behaviour are convergent with previous reports. On the other hand, our sample has enough power to exclude the other polymorphisms investigated as major candidate for suicidality in bipolar disorder.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar/panic comorbidity has been observed in clinical, community and familial samples. As both are episodic disorders of affect regulation, the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala-mediated, plasticity-dependent emotional conditioning. Neuronal genesis and synaptic remodeling occur in the amygdala; bipolar and panic disorders have both been associated with abnormality in the amygdala and related structures, as well as in molecules that modulate plasticity, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). These biological elements are involved in behavioral conditioning to threat and reward. Panic attacks resemble the normal acute fear response, but are abnormally dissociated from any relevant threat. Abnormal reward-seeking behavior is central to both manic and depressive syndromes. Appetites can be elevated or depressed; satisfaction of a drive may fail to condition future behavior. These dissociations may be the result of deficits in plasticity-dependent processes of conditioning within different amygdala subregions. This speculative model may be a useful framework with which to connect molecular, cellular, anatomic and behavioral processes in panic and bipolar disorders. The primary clinical implication is that behavioral treatment may be critical to restore function in some bipolar patients who respond only partially to medications.",

Hypersomnia was more likely to be reported than early morning wakening across all age bands by those with non-melancholic depression.

The study was retrospective, undertaken in a sample attending a tertiary referral unit and artefactual determinants of the associations were not pursued. We speculate that hypersomnia may be a non-specific homeostatic coping response to stress and thus to the non-melancholic depressive disorders, but that this pattern is overruled by an early morning wakening pattern in the more biological depressive sub-types as the individual ages, perhaps reflecting a noradrenergic contribution.",

Although they are likely to provide effective symptom relief in combination with mood stabilizers, the risk of precipitating a switch to mania often complicates their use even as combination therapy. Recently, 2 psychotropic medications approved for treating acute mania, olanzapine and quetiapine, have also been shown to possess antidepressant activity without destabilizing mood and, as such, are potential mood stabilizers. This article aims to review the mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and newer agents that are effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. A number of mechanisms have been postulated to play a role in the effective treatment of bipolar depression, including targets as diverse as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and various second messenger signaling pathways. A review of the data reveals an important point of commonality among the antidepressant treatments, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Antidepressant treatments, such as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and electroconvulsive therapy, induce a reduction of 5-HT(2A) receptors. Both olanzapine and quetiapine not only are antagonists at this receptor but also induce downregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. It is possible that the antidepressant efficacy of these agents is mediated by this receptor, while the additional benefit of olanzapine and quetiapine over unimodal antidepressant treatments, in terms of stabilizing mood, may be provided by their concomitant dopamine D(2) antagonism. Further studies should be conducted to examine these hypotheses.",

Most patients with mood disorders who receive treatment with supraphysiological doses of levothyroxine have normal peripheral thyroid hormone levels, and also respond differently to the hormone and tolerate it better than healthy individuals and patients with primary thyroid diseases. Progress in molecular and functional brain imaging techniques has provided a new understanding of these phenomena, illuminating the relationship between thyroid function, mood modulation and behavior. Thyroid hormones are widely distributed in the brain and have a multitude of effects on the central nervous system. Notably many of the limbic system structures where thyroid hormone receptors are prevalent have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. The influence of the thyroid system on neurotransmitters (particularly serotonin and norepinephrine), which putatively play a major role in the regulation of mood and behavior, may contribute to the mechanisms of mood modulation. Recent functional brain imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) with [ (18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated that thyroid hormone treatment with levothyroxine affects regional brain metabolism in patients with hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder. Theses studies confirm that thyroid hormones are active in modulating metabolic function in the mature adult brain, and provide intriging neuroanatomic clues that may guide future research.",
