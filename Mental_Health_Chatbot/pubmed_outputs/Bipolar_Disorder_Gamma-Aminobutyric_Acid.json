        "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13)\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.66, p\u2009=\u20090.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness and often occurs with comorbidities like anxiety or alcohol abuse. Thus pregabalin could be a promising drug. We present a case report of a 37-year-old woman with bipolar II disorder suffering from a depressive episode with features of anxiety and increased alcohol consumption. The patient was started on quetiapine as monotherapy. After a few days of add-on pregabalin, we observed suicidal ideations and self-harming behaviour, although expression of anxiety as well as alcohol consumption showed a decrease. When we stopped pregabalin and increased the dosage of quetiapine, suicidal behaviour almost disappeared. In the relevant literature, there is disagreement on the use of pregabalin. On the one hand, pregabalin is described as a safe and well-tolerated drug, and on the other hand, there are also concerns about the suicidal effect of anticonvulsants. In conclusion, we recommend the cautious use of pregabalin and other anticonvulsant drugs in patients with affective disorder. There could be a promising effect on the comorbidities but the effect on mood remains still unclear.",

        "abstract": "Persistent cognitive deficits and functional impairments are associated with bipolar disorder (BD), even during the euthymic phase. The dysfunction of default mode network (DMN) is critical for self-referential and emotional mental processes and is implicated in BD. The current study aims to explore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate and <i>\u03b3</i>-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in hubs of the DMN during the euthymic patients with BD (euBD). Thirty-four euBD and 55 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to the study. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), glutamate (with PRESS sequence) and GABA levels (with MEGAPRESS sequence) were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Measured concentrations of excitatory glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and inhibitory GABA were used to calculate the excitatory/inhibitory (<i>E</i>/<i>I</i>) ratio. Executive and attentional functions were respectively assessed using the Wisconsin card-sorting test and continuous performance test. euBD performed worse on attentional function than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Compared to controls, euBD had higher <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratios in the PCC (<i>p</i> = 0.023), mainly driven by a higher Glx level in the PCC of euBD (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Only in the BD group, a marginally significant negative association between the mPFC <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratio (Glx/GABA) and executive function was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.068). Disturbed E/I balance, particularly elevated Glx/GABA ratio in PCC is observed in euBD. The <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> balance in hubs of DMN may serve as potential biomarkers for euBD, which may also contribute to their poorer executive function.",

        "abstract": "Brain oscillations have gained great attention in neuroscience during recent decades as functional building blocks of cognitive-sensory processes. Research has shown that oscillations in \"alpha,\" \"beta,\" \"gamma,\" \"delta,\" and \"theta\" frequency windows are highly modified in brain pathology, including in patients with cognitive impairment like bipolar disorder (BD). The study of changes in brain oscillations can provide fundamental knowledge for exploring neurophysiological biomarkers in cognitive impairment. The present article reviews findings from the role and molecular basis of abnormal neural oscillation and synchronization in the symptoms of patients with BD. An overview of the results clearly demonstrates that, in cognitive-sensory processes, resting and evoked/event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands are abnormally changed in patients with BD showing psychotic features. Abnormal oscillations have been found to be associated with several neural dysfunctions and abnormalities contributing to BD, including abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission signaling, hippocampal cell discharge, abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis, impaired cadherin and synaptic contact-based cell adhesion processes, extended lateral ventricles, decreased prefrontal cortical gray matter, and decreased hippocampal volume. Mechanistically, impairment in calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 I, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase proteins, genes involved in brain neurogenesis and synaptogenesis like WNT3 and ACTG2, genes involved in the cell adhesion process like CDH12 and DISC1, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling have been reported as the main molecular contributors to the abnormalities in resting-state low-frequency oscillations in BD patients. Findings also showed the association of impaired synaptic connections and disrupted membrane potential with abnormal beta/gamma oscillatory activity in patients with BD. Of note, the synaptic GABA neurotransmitter has been found to be a fundamental requirement for the occurrence of long-distance synchronous gamma oscillations necessary for coordinating the activity of neural networks between various brain regions.",

        "abstract": "The gabapentinoids, gabapentin, and pregabalin, target the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels. Initially licensed for pain and seizures, they have become widely prescribed drugs. Many of these uses are off-label for psychiatric indications, and there is increasing concern about their safety, so it is particularly important to have good evidence to justify this usage. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for three of their common psychiatric uses: bipolar disorder, anxiety, and insomnia. Fifty-five double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 open-label studies were identified. For bipolar disorder, four double-blind RCTs investigating gabapentin, and no double-blind RCTs investigating pregabalin, were identified. A quantitative synthesis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in the study population, design and outcome measures. Across the anxiety spectrum, a consistent but not universal effect in favour of gabapentinoids compared to placebo was seen (standardised mean difference [SMD] ranging between -2.25 and -0.25). Notably, pregabalin (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.18) and gabapentin (SMD -0.92, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.52) were more effective than placebo in reducing preoperative anxiety. In insomnia, results were inconclusive. We conclude that there is moderate evidence of the efficacy of gabapentinoids in anxiety states, but minimal evidence in bipolar disorder and insomnia and they should be used for these disorders only with strong justification. This recommendation applies despite the attractive pharmacological and genetic rationale for targeting voltage-gated calcium channels.",

        "abstract": "Suicide in Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a relevant clinical concern. Genetics may shape the individual risk for suicide behavior in BD, together with known clinical factors. The lack of consistent replication in BD may be associated with its multigenetic component. In the present contribution we analyzed a sample of BD individuals (from STEP-BD database) to identify the genetic variants potentially associated with three different suicide-related phenotypes: (1) a feeling that the life was not worth living; (2) fantasies about committing a violent suicide; (3) previous attempted suicide. The sample under analysis included 1115 BD individuals. None of the SNPs reached genome-wide significance. However, a trend of association was evidenced for rs2767403, an intron variant of AOPEP gene, in association with phenotype #1 (<i>p</i> = 5.977 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>). The molecular pathway analysis showed a significant enrichment in all the investigated phenotypes on pathways related to post synaptic signaling, neurotransmission and neurodevelopment. Further, NOTCH signaling or the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic signaling were found to be associated with specific suicide-related phenotypes. The present investigation contributes to the hypothesis that the genetic architecture of suicide behaviors in BD is related to alteration of entire pathways rather than single genes. In particular, our molecular pathway analysis points on some specific molecular events that could be the focus of further research in this field.",

Gabapentin is a safe and well-tolerated medication, FDA-approved to treat other neurological diseases, that restores GABA/glutamate homeostasis, with treatment studies supporting efficacy in treating CUD, as well as anxiety and sleep disorders that are common to both BD and CUD. The present manuscript represents the primary report of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover (1-week/condition), multimodal-MRI (proton-MR spectroscopy, functional MRI) pilot study of gabapentin (1200\u2009mg/day) in BD\u2009+\u2009CUD (n\u00a0=\u200922). Primary analyses revealed that (1) gabapentin was well tolerated and adherence and retention were high, (2) gabapentin increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right basal ganglia (rBG) glutamate levels and (3) gabapentin increased activation to visual cannabis cues in the posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC, a region involved in response inhibition to rewarding stimuli). Exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes further found that in participants taking gabapentin versus placebo, (1) elevations of dACC GABA levels were associated with lower manic/mixed and depressive symptoms and (2) elevations of rBG glutamate levels and pMCC activation to cannabis cues were associated with lower cannabis use. Though promising, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution due to observed randomization order effects on dACC glutamate levels and identification of statistical moderators that differed by randomization order (i.e. cigarette-smoking status on rBG glutamate levels and pMCC cue activation). Nonetheless, they provide the necessary foundation for a more robustly designed (urn-randomized, parallel-group) future study of adjuvant gabapentin for BD\u2009+\u2009CUD.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar disorder type I is a severe psychiatric condition that leads to significant morbidity and mortality and whose treatment remains suboptimal. Its pathophysiology involves disturbance in the control of ionic fluxes so that when patients are either manic or depressed, the resting membrane potential of neurons is more depolarized than normal. Available mood stabilizers have a shared mechanism of normalizing ion flux by compensating for ionic abnormalities, and normalizing membrane potential. Agents that significantly potentiate extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are expected to be particularly effective in hyperpolarizing resting membrane potential in bipolar patients, thereby normalizing their membrane potential. New neuroactive steroid-like agents are being tested in humans for depression and insomnia. These agents include brexanolone, ganaxolone, and gaboxadol. Brexanolone has been approved for the treatment of postpartum depression, ganaxolone is being studied for treatment-resistant depression, and gaboxadol development for the treatment of insomnia has been abandoned due to narrow therapeutic index. In addition to the current studies, these agents are expected to have particular efficacy in acute and prophylactic management of bipolar I disorder by hyperpolarizing the resting potential of neurons and antagonizing one of the most reproducible demonstrated biologic abnormalities of this illness.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by unstable mood states ranging from mania to depression. Although there is some evidence that mood instability may result from an imbalance between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurotransmission, few proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) studies have measured these two neurometabolites simultaneously in BD. The enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD1) catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate (Glu) to GABA, and its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might influence Glu/GABA ratio. Thus, we investigated Glu/GABA ratio in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of euthymic BD type I patients and healthy controls (HC), and assessed the influence of both mood stabilizers and GAD1 SNPs on this ratio. Eighty-eight subjects (50 euthymic BD type I patients and 38 HC) underwent 3T <sup>1</sup>H-MRS in the dACC (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) using a two-dimensional JPRESS sequence and all subjects were genotyped for 4 SNPs in the GAD1 gene. BD patients had lower dACC Glu/GABA ratio compared to HC, where this was influenced by anticonvulsant and antipsychotic medications, but not lithium. The presence of GAD1 rs1978340 allele A was associated with higher Glu/GABA ratio in BD, while patients without this allele taking mood stabilizers had a lower Glu/GABA ratio. The lowering of dACC Glu/GABA could be one explanation for the mood stabilizing action of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics in BD type I euthymia. Therefore, this putative role of Glu/GABA ratio and the influence of GAD1 genotype interacting with mood stabilization medication should be confirmed by further studies involving larger samples and other mood states.ClincalTrials.gov registration: NCT01237158.",

We compared sources (e.g., journal articles, clinical study reports (CSRs)) of trials for two drug-indications-gabapentin for neuropathic pain and quetiapine for bipolar depression.

All CSRs reported all AEs without applying selection criteria; by comparison, no other source reported all AEs, and 15/68 (22%) gabapentin sources and 19/48 (40%) quetiapine sources reported using selection criteria. Selection criteria greatly affected the number of AEs reported.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the relationship among lithium, GADL1, and KCTD12. In circulating CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophage cells, BPI patients showed a significantly higher percentage of KCTD12 expression than healthy controls. Among BPI patients, carriers of the 'T' allele (i.e., CT or TT) at site rs17026688 were found to secrete lower amounts of GADL1 but higher amounts of GABA b receptor 2 (GABBR2) in the plasma. In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, lithium treatment increased the percentage of KCTD12 expression. Through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), lithium induced cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated KCTD12 promoter activation. On the other hand, GADL1 overexpression enhanced GSK-3 activation and inhibited KCTD12 expression. We found that lithium induced, whereas GADL1 inhibited, KCTD12 expression. These findings suggested that KCTD12 may be an important gene with respect to neuron excitability and lithium response in BPI patients.

Microscopic studies show changes in cell count, density, and morphology in these areas. Some of those changes are observed only in certain layers of the cerebral cortex. A valuable addition to this data are histochemical studies of neuronal survival markers, proinflammatory cytokines, trophic factors, and markers specific for particular cellular structures. The role of monoaminergic, GABA-ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission is confirmed by the studies on concentration of neurotransmitters, their receptors and transporters. Some of the results correlate quantitatively with the type and severity of symptoms, duration of the disorder, as well as pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacological treatment.",

        "title": "The association between gabapentin and suicidality in bipolar patients.",
        "abstract": "The aims of this study were to assess the association between gabapentin and suicidality in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and to determine whether the risk is greater relative to patients prescribed lithium. This retrospective observational study utilizes US population-based claims data assembled by PharMetrics Inc., comprising 47\u2009918 patients diagnosed with BD. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years old and initiated a new monotherapy prescription of either gabapentin (n=2421) or lithium (n=3101). Patients were followed for up to 1 year. Gabapentin patients contributed 915.8 person-years (PY) of follow-up time; lithium patients contributed 1421.3 PY. There were 21 suicide/self-harm events in the gabapentin group and 16 in the lithium group. Unadjusted incidence rates were 22.9 and 11.3/1000 PY in the gabapentin and lithium groups, respectively (P=0.03). After adjusting for concomitant medications, comorbid diagnoses, age, sex, and history of suicide/self-harm, the hazard ratio was 2.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-4.5). A propensity score-matched analysis accounting for pre-existing illnesses and medications supports this finding, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.5). Relative to lithium, the use of gabapentin is significantly associated with a doubling of the risk of suicidality in patients diagnosed with BD.",

        "title": "Real-world Effectiveness of Pharmacologic Treatments for the Prevention of Rehospitalization in a Finnish Nationwide Cohort of Patients With Bipolar Disorder.",
        "abstract": "Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are the main maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder. Lithium is considered to be the most effective mood stabilizer, but very little is known about overall health outcomes associated with specific treatments and the comparative long-term effectiveness of specific psychotropics or routes of administration in the prevention of rehospitalizations. To study the comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments in the prevention of rehospitalization in a nationwide cohort of patients with bipolar disorder. This cohort study examined the risk of psychiatric, cardiovascular, and all-cause hospitalization from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2012, among all patients in Finland who had been hospitalized for bipolar disorder (N\u2009=\u200918\u202f018; mean follow-up time, 7.2 years) using prospectively gathered nationwide databases for hospitalization and dispensed medications. The primary analysis was within-individual analysis, in which each individual was used as his or her own control to eliminate selection bias. The study adjusted for the effect of concomitant psychotropic medications, duration of illness, and the temporal orders of exposure and nonexposure periods. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2012. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for rehospitalization were calculated. Among the cohort (9558 women and 8460 men; mean [SD] age, 46.6 [17.0] years), 9721 patients (54.0%) had at least 1 psychiatric rehospitalization. In comparison between use and no use among specific agents reaching nominal statistical significance, risperidone long-acting injection (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34-1.00]), gabapentin (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44-0.77]), perphenazine long-acting injection (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41-0.88]), and lithium carbonate (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60-0.73]) were associated with the lowest risk of psychiatric rehospitalization. Concerning all-cause hospitalization, lithium (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.66-0.76]) was associated with the lowest risk. The most frequently used antipsychotic treatment, quetiapine fumarate, showed only modest effectiveness (risk of psychiatric rehospitalization: HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.98]; risk of all-cause hospitalization: HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.98]). Long-acting injections were associated with substantially better outcomes compared with identical oral antipsychotics (risk of psychiatric rehospitalization: HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55-0.90]; risk of all-cause hospitalization: HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.86]). Results from sensitivity analyses showed consistent beneficial effects only for lithium and for long-acting injections compared with their oral counterparts. Lithium was the most effective mood stabilizer, and long-acting injections the most effective antipsychotics, in preventing hospitalization due to mental or physical illness.",

        "title": "Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy changes after lithium treatment. Systematic review.",
        "abstract": "1H MRS is widely used in the research of mental disorders. It enables evaluation of concentration or ratios of several metabolites, which play important roles in brain metabolism: N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline containing compounds, myo-inositol and glutamate, glutamine and GABA (together as Glx complex or separately). Specifically in bipolar disorder brain metabolite abnormalities include mostly NAA reduces and Glx increases in different brain regions.\u00a0Bipolar disorder is associated with impairment in neurotrophic and cellular plasticity, resilience pathways and in neuroprotective processes. Lithium, which is commonly used in BD treatment, modulates neurotransmitter release, reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis, induces angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neurotrophic response. Thus brain metabolite abnormalities may elucidate the mechanisms of this processes. In the present article we systematically reviewed 26 studies\u00a0- the majority of them investigated bipolar disorder ( 7 follow-up and all 11 cross-sectional studies). Moreover we dispute whether the influence of lithium on brain metabolites in bipolar disorder could explain the background of its potential neuroprotective action. The results of our literature review do not equivocally confirm Lithium's influence the metabolite changes in the brain. The majority of the follow-up studies do not support the initially assumed influence of Lithium on the increase of NAA level in various brain structures. The results of studies are inconclusive with regard to levels of Glx or Glu and Lithium intake, rather point a lack of relationship. The above results were reviewed according to the most recent theories in the field accounting for the impact of lithium (1)HMRS measures.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have measured central and peripheral \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in patients with depression. We performed a meta-analysis to provide an objective overview of GABA changes in those with unipolar or bipolar depression. After a systematic database search, original data were extracted with the help of seminal authors to calculate standardized mean differences. We compared GABA levels between patients with current major depressive episodes and controls, between euthymic patients and controls, and in patients before and after treatment. We performed meta-regressions to explore the influence of demographic and clinical variables on GABA significant mean differences. For unipolar depression, central and peripheral GABA levels were diminished in currently depressed patients, but normal in euthymic patients, compared with the healthy controls. For bipolar disorder, GABA levels were diminished in medication-free patients, but seemed to be normalized in medicated patients, compared with the healthy controls. We found no significant association with demographic or clinical variables. There was a great heterogeneity across studies, probably because of the substantial variation of clinical characteristics in the included samples. Many subanalyses were performed to assess how the diagnosis, medications, or the type of measurements of peripheral or central GABA levels may affect the main results. The GABA levels evolved differentially in patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders. Our results suggest that GABA levels could represent a biomarker of symptomatic states in patients with unipolar disorder and would be normalized by mood stabilizers in those with bipolar disorder.",
