        "abstract": "Experiencing early-life stress has been considered as a potent risk factor for the development of many of brain disorders, including seizures. Intervening mechanisms through which neonatal maternal separation (MS) alters the seizure susceptibility in adulthood have not been well studied. In the current study, by applying 180 min of MS stress (PND 2-14), we determined the seizure susceptibility and considered the role of the opioid system. Maternal separation increased the seizure threshold, and administration of anticonvulsant/proconvulsant doses of morphine (1 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) reversed the impact of MS. Using tail flick and hot plate tests, we exposed animals to 30 min Restraint stress (RS) and found that MS decreased the pain threshold, suggesting the hyporesponsiveness of the opioid system. These results supported the abnormal seizure activity observed in the MS mice and suggested that abnormalities in the opioid system following MS alter seizure susceptibility in later life.",

        "abstract": "To review the mechanisms for the perception of dyspnea and to consider the plausibility of interventions that palliate dyspnea after optimal treatment of the underlying disease. Activation of sensory receptors by blood gas abnormalities, mechanical respiratory loads, and hyperinflation provides afferent information to the central nervous system for integration and processing. It has been proposed that a discriminative pathway processes afferent impulses to the somatosensory cortex that reflects the intensity of dyspnea, whereas an affective pathway projects afferent impulses to structures of the limbic system that reflects the unpleasantness of dyspnea. In one study, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reported consistently higher ratings of breathlessness after administration of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, compared with physiological saline during high-intensity treadmill exercise. This finding supports the role of endogenous opioids in modulating dyspnea. Nebulized furosemide, anti-inflammatory therapy, and chest wall vibration are potential approaches for modulating lung and chest wall receptors to relieve dyspnea. Targets for palliating dyspnea in patients with advanced disease include sensory receptors within the lung/chest wall and the central nervous system. The opioid system plays an important role in palliating dyspnea. Both endogenous (\u03b2-endorphins) and exogenous (morphine) opioids modulate breathlessness.",

        "abstract": "The advantages of physical activity are widely recognised from both a physiological and a psychological perspective. Evidence seems to demonstrate that physical activity is associated with decreases in depression and anxiety in clinical and non-clinical populations. There are a number of physiological, biochemical and psychological explanations which should be considered to understand the psychological effects of exercise. Physical activity may be considered as an adjunct to psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments of depression and anxiety. Physical activity appears to be a non-specific form of treatment with psychotherapeutic potential that should not be ignored.",

This group of behaviours presents itself commonly in clinical behavioural practice. In recent companion animal behaviour literature the nomenclature has been changed to obsessive-compulsive disorder without considering the confusion this may create. Theories about the role endorphins play as a cause of stereotypies and an assumption about stereotypies playing a 'coping' role have been presented as scientific fact with little evidence supporting them. A failure to consider changes associated with stereotypy maturation and a reliance on anecdotal treatment success has lead to confusion regarding certain aspects of the development, diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.

The following experiments evaluated whether 50-kHz vocalizations reflect positive social affect by determining (1) if tickling is a rewarding event, (2) if social or isolate housing conditions differentially influence the response (since housing condition has been found to effect the reward magnitude of social encounters), and (3) if drugs that work on mu-opiate receptors, which has been hypothesized to control positive social affect, modulate tickling. Tickling was positively reinforcing as demonstrated by elevated operant behavior, conditioned place preference, and approach measures. A significant negative correlation between vocalization rate and approach latency measures was found. Social housing reduced tickle-induced vocalizations and approach speeds compared to isolate housing. Naloxone (1 mg/kg) increased vocalization in the socially housed rats and decreased it in isolated Subjects (Ss). These findings suggest that tickling can be used to induce positive social affect in rodents, and that it is modulated by endogenous opioids.",

Plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin (beta-EP), cortisol (CORT), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and testosterone (Te) were measured immediately before the beginning of the tests and 30 min later at their end. Mean prestress values of GH, PRL, beta-EP and ACTH were significantly higher in anxious subjects than in controls. There was no difference in NE, EPI, CORT and Te prestress levels in the two groups. After the psychological stress session NE, GH and Te concentrations increased significantly in anxious subjects (A), but not in controls. In contrast, beta-EP and PRL decreased significantly during the psychological stress session in anxious subjects, and were unaffected by stress in the subjects without anxiety. No significant changes were found in ACTH, CORT and EPI during the challenge either in anxious subjects or in controls, which may be attributed to the late time of poststress blood sampling. In contrast to controls, heart rate and systolic blood pressure increased significantly in anxious subjects after psychological stress testing. Our data support the hypothesis that the hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system in response to stress is associated with anxiety disorders in adolescents and might influence the responses of GH and Te. High prestress basal values of stress hormones seem to be induced in anxious subjects by the anticipation of the task or by a persistent hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system. Further studies are needed to investigate in more detail the involvement of the HPA axis in anxious adolescents by a more refined resolution of time points of blood sampling.",

        "title": "No evidence for opioid-mediated analgesia induced by phobic fear.",
        "abstract": "The influence of anxiety on acute pain sensation was investigated, studying the relative contribution of endogenous opioids and attentional mechanisms. Thirty-six spider phobics received mildly painful electrical stimulation, while anxiety and focus of attention were manipulated within subjects. The opioid antagonist naloxone or placebo was administered between subjects to examine an analgesia owing to anxiety-induced endorphinergic activity. In contrast to earlier findings, attention towards pain failed to increase pain as opposed to distraction from pain, probably owing to a less effective attention manipulation. Furthermore, despite high levels of anxiety, subjective pain ratings were not influenced by anxiety, although heart rate responses were slightly inhibited. Accordingly, there was no increase in subjective or physiological pain responses as a result of naloxone, nor did beta-endorphin plasma levels rise during anxiety. The results suggest that phobic anxiety does not induce an opioid-mediated analgesia. Curiously, naloxone itself effected a dose-dependent analgesia compared to placebo during both high and low anxiety, which is compatible with the assumption of agonist properties of naloxone in the absence of opioid activity.",

Forty-five spider phobics received mildly painful electrical stimulation. The opioid antagonist naltrexone or placebo was administered between subjects to examine an analgesia due to anxiety-induced endorphinergic activity, while anxiety and focus of attention were manipulated within subjects. In accordance with previous research, pain ratings and skin conductance responses (SCRs) were not influenced by anxiety when focus of attention was controlled for. Attention towards pain led to an increase in subjective pain as opposed to distraction from pain. SCRs, however, were increased in the distraction conditions, probably due to heightened unexpectedness. Further, both high and low anxiety resulted in an analgesia compared to the pretest in the placebo condition, which was reversed by a low dose of naltrexone, but not by a high dose. Apart from possible agonist properties of high doses of naltrexone, this effect suggests an opioid-induced analgesia. It remains to be demonstrated whether this was due to endogenous opioids released during high anxiety.",

The frequency of panic attacks between the three pentagastrin doses in patients was not different. One control subject had a panic-like attack at the highest dose of pentagastrin.

With regard to panic disorder, the key role of the spontaneous panic attack became apparent from several viewpoints. However, panics seem to be a type of misreleased fear, which guided the thinking concerning the nature of possible psychological or physiological malfunctions. We indicate that spontaneous panic cannot be fear, but must represent some other malfunction and suggest that the spontaneous panic is a suffocation false alarm. The development of this idea is outlined, and attempts to develop tests of this hypothesis are indicated. In particular, studies of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, dyspnea, field measures of panic, pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, as well as the premenstrual syndrome afford pointed opportunities, new information and potential tests of the theory. A recent challenge to the theory from acetazolamide infusion is discussed. Developing a possible antecedent for the pathologically depressed threshold for the suffocation alarm, in the form of a phasic endorphinergic deficiency, is presented.",

At 1-wk follow-up, naltrexone was significantly related, in a dose-dependent way, to a greater relapse on avoidance measures but not on emotional, cognitive, and physiological measures.
