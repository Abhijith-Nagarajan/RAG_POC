        "abstract": "CO<sub>2</sub> exposure has been used to investigate the panicogenic response in patients with panic disorder. These patients are more sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub>, and more likely to experience the \"false suffocation alarm\" which triggers panic attacks. Imbalances in locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) neurotransmission are responsible for psychiatric disorders, including panic disorder. These neurons are sensitive to changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/pH. Therefore, we investigated if LC-NA neurons are differentially activated after severe hypercapnia in mice. Further, we evaluated the participation of LC-NA neurons in ventilatory and panic-like escape responses induced by 20% CO<sub>2</sub> in male and female wild type mice and two mouse models of altered LC-NA synthesis. Hypercapnia activates the LC-NA neurons, with males presenting a heightened level of activation. Mutant males lacking or with reduced LC-NA synthesis showed hypoventilation, while animals lacking LC noradrenaline present an increased metabolic rate compared to wild type in normocapnia. When exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>, males lacking LC noradrenaline showed a lower respiratory frequency compared to control animals. On the other hand, females lacking LC noradrenaline presented a higher tidal volume. Nevertheless, no change in ventilation was observed in either sex. CO<sub>2</sub> evoked an active escape response. Mice lacking LC noradrenaline had a blunted jumping response and an increased freezing duration compared to the other groups. They also presented fewer racing episodes compared to wild type animals, but not different from mice with reduced LC noradrenaline. These findings suggest that LC-NA has an important role in ventilatory and panic-like escape responses elicited by CO<sub>2</sub> exposure in mice.",

        "abstract": "Visual stimuli and limbic activation varyingly influence obsessive-compulsive symptom expression and so impact treatment outcomes. Some symptom phenotypes, for example, covert repugnant thoughts, are likely less sensitive to sensory stimuli compared to symptoms with an extrinsic focus, that is, symptoms related to contamination, safety, and \"just-right-perceptions.\" Toward an improved understanding of the neurocognitive underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive psychobiology, work in naturalistic animal model systems is useful. Here, we explored the impact of visual feedback and limbic processes on 24 normal (NNB) and large (LNB) nesting deer mice, respectively (as far as possible, equally distributed between sexes). Briefly, after behavioral classification into either the NNB or LNB cohorts, mice of each cohort were separated into two groups each and assessed for nesting expression under either standard light conditions or conditions of complete visual deprivation (VD). Nesting outcomes were assessed in terms of size and neatness. After nesting assessment completion, mice were euthanized, and samples of frontal-cortical and hippocampal tissues were collected to determine serotonin and noradrenaline concentrations. Our results show that LNB, as opposed to NNB, represents an inflexible and excessive behavioral phenotype that is not dependent on visually guided action-outcome processing, and that it associates with increased frontal-cortical and hippocampal noradrenaline concentrations, irrespective of lighting condition. Collectively, the current results are informing of the neurocognitive underpinnings of nesting behavior. It also provides a valuable foundation for continued investigations into the noradrenergic mechanisms that may influence the development and promulgation of excessive, rigid, and inflexible behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) are related mental disorders that share genetic, neurobiological, and phenomenological features. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a neuropsychiatric autoimmune disorder with symptoms of OCD and/or TS associated with streptococcal infections. Therefore, PANDAS represents a strong link between OCD, TS, and autoimmunity. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses can provide insight into the central nervous processes in OCD, TS, and PANDAS. A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA criteria was conducted to collect all CSF studies in patients with OCD, TS, and PANDAS. The total number of cases and the heterogeneity of the low number of studies were not sufficient for a meta-analysis to provide a high level of evidence. Nevertheless, meta-analytical statistics could be performed for glutamate, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (degradation product of serotonin), homovanillic acid (degradation product of dopamine), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (major metabolite of noradrenaline), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in OCD. A risk-of-bias assessment was implemented using the Cochrane ROBINS-E tool. Meta-analytical testing identified elevated glutamate levels in the CSF of OCD patients compared with healthy controls, while no significant differences were found in other neurotransmitters or CRH. Single studies detected novel neuronal antibodies in OCD patients and elevated oligoclonal bands in TS patients. For TS and PANDAS groups, there was a dearth of data. Risk of bias assessment indicated a substantial risk of bias in most of the included studies. This systematic review of available CSF data shows that too few studies are currently available for conclusions with good evidence. The existing data indicates glutamate alterations in OCD and possible immunological abnormalities in OCD and TS. More CSF studies avoiding sources of bias are needed.",

We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added unique pressures on those with PADs, as children and adolescents endured the longest pandemic restrictions, stymieing their ability to develop socially, emotionally, and cognitively. Although first-line treatment for PADs is psychotherapy, those with severe anxiety symptoms will require pharmacological interventions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications are effective in treating PADs, yet only duloxetine (a SNRI) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children aged >7 years with generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment of children and adolescents with benzodiazepines for PADs presents unique challenges with potential paradoxical reactions. Caution must be observed as well due to risk for misuse related to long-term use of benzodiazepines with PADs. [<i>Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 60</i>(9), 6-9.].",

The studies included consisted of randomized controlled trials evaluating non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. clomipramine), SSRIs, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, CBT, or a combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy. Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were 18\u2009years or younger. A total of 86 studies were included, with a total of 7594 participants, of which 41.51% were females. For remission, all three treatments were significantly more effective than both placebo (ORs ranging from 0.07 and 0.18) and wait-list (ORs ranging from 0.06 and 0.16). In terms of the severity of anxiety symptoms, all treatment forms were significantly more effective for reducing anxiety than wait-list (standardized mean differences (SMDs) ranging from 0.98 and 2.91). Only pharmacotherapy was significantly more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo (SMD = 2.01, 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.01). Overall, the results demonstrate that CBT, pharmacotherapy, and their combination are effective treatments for childhood ADs. There was no significant difference between the three treatment forms. However, CBT was associated with lower attrition rates. CBT, pharmacotherapy, and the combination of the two should all be considered to treat youths with ADs.

The present study attempted to clarify the possible neurochemical mechanisms of caffeine's action by selectively depleting norepinephrine with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or serotonin with para-chlorophenylalanine in two separate experiments and assessing the ability for caffeine to alter anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior. Caffeine-treated adolescent male rats were exposed to caffeine (0.25\u2009g/L) in their drinking water beginning on P28. A-methyl-p-tyrosine, para-chlorophenylalanine, or saline were administered prior to light-dark, open field, and forced swim testing beginning on P45. Caffeine-induced reductions in immobility and increases in swimming in the forced swim test were reversed by both a-methyl-p-tyrosine and para-chlorophenylalanine. Caffeine-induced increases in crosses and rears were reversed by para-chlorophenylalanine but not alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, whereas caffeine-induced increases in transitions in the LD test were reversed by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine but not para-chlorophenylalanine. Taken together, these results suggest that caffeine-induced decreases in immobility in male rats requires both norepinephrine and serotonin as depletion of either prevents the induction of immobility by chronic caffeine.",

Many OCD patients do not respond to available pharmacotherapies, but neurosurgical ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can provide symptomatic relief.

We assessed NE-deficient (Dbh -/-) mice and NE-competent (Dbh +/-) controls in MB and NS tasks. We also measured the effects of anti-adrenergic drugs on NS and MB in control mice and the effects of pharmacological restoration of central NE in Dbh -/- mice. Finally, we compared c-fos induction in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ACC of Dbh -/- and control mice following both tasks. Dbh -/- mice virtually lacked MB and NS behaviors seen in control mice but did not differ in the elevated zero maze (EZM) model of general anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological restoration of central NE synthesis in Dbh -/- mice completely rescued NS behavior, while NS and MB were suppressed in control mice by anti-adrenergic drugs. Expression of c-fos in the ACC was attenuated in Dbh -/- mice after MB and NS. These findings support a role for NE transmission to the ACC in the expression of stress-induced compulsive behaviors and suggest further evaluation of anti-adrenergic drugs for OCD is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety in Parkinson's disease may represent a physiological reaction to the development of other symptoms during disease progression. However, evidence suggests that the incidence of anxiety disorders in Parkinson's disease may be related to neurochemical changes. The present study addresses the question whether dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin levels in brain structures related to Parkinson's disease and anxiety are responsible for anxiety-like behavior by using an animal model of parkinsonism based in the bilateral injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the substantia nigra pars compacta. For this, one day after the injection of 6-OHDA, the animals exhibited hypolocomotion and a lower frequency of rearings in the open field test, which was spontaneously reversed on the last day of motor assessment (day 21). The 6-OHDA injection also induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and contextual fear conditioning test (day 21 and 24, respectively). Neurochemical analysis showed a reduction of dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. In addition, while the serotonin levels were reduced in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, it was increased in the amygdala. The present study indicates that the model of 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonism in rats induced an anxiety-like behavior that may be related to a dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems in brain areas involved with anxiety such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and striatum.",

There were no significant differences in efficacy between pharmacological agents within each class or when comparing SSRIs to SNRIs. The greatest treatment benefits were observed for social anxiety disorder for both medication classes. Higher doses of SSRIs, but not SNRIs, were associated with significantly greater symptom improvement and likelihood of treatment response. For both medical classes, higher doses were associated with an increased likelihood of dropout due to side effects. SSRIs and SNRIs are effective in treating anxiety disorders.

MicroRNAs regulate dynamic gene expression during synaptic plasticity and genetic variation of microRNAs modulating noradrenaline transporter gene (SLC6A2) expression may thus lead to altered central and peripheral processing of fear and anxiety. In silico prediction of microRNA regulation of SLC6A2 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays and identified hsa-miR-579-3p as a regulating microRNA. The minor (T)-allele of rs2910931 (MAF<sub>cases</sub>\u2009=\u20090.431, MAF<sub>controls</sub>\u2009=\u20090.368) upstream of MIR579 was associated with panic disorder in patients (p<sub>allelic</sub>\u2009=\u20090.004, n<sub>cases</sub>\u2009=\u2009506, n<sub>controls</sub>\u2009=\u2009506) and with higher trait anxiety in healthy individuals (p<sub>ASI</sub>\u2009=\u20090.029, p<sub>ACQ</sub>\u2009=\u20090.047, n\u2009=\u20093112).

However, CRF signaling can also acutely regulate binge alcohol consumption, anxiety, and affect in non-dependent animals, possibly via modulation of central monoaminergic signaling. We hypothesize that basal CRF tone is particularly high in animals and humans with an inherent propensity for high anxiety and alcohol consumption, and thus these individuals are at increased risk for the development of alcohol use disorder and comorbid neuropsychiatric diseases. The current review focuses on extrahypothalamic CRF circuits, particularly those stemming from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), found to play a role in basal phenotypes, and examines whether the intrinsic hyperactivity of these circuits is sufficient to escalate the expression of these behaviors and steepen the trajectory of development of disease states. We focus our efforts on describing CRF modulation of biogenic amine neuron populations that have widespread projections to the forebrain to modulate behaviors, including alcohol and drug intake, stress reactivity, and anxiety. Further, we review the known sex differences and estradiol modulation of these neuron populations and CRF signaling at their synapses to address the question of whether females are more susceptible to the development of comorbid addiction and stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases because of hyperactive extrahypothalamic CRF circuits compared to males.",

NET impairment is evident in several clinically important conditions including major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), essential hypertension and the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We aimed to determine whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the NET gene is associated with NET impairment and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. The analyses were carried out in two cohorts of European ancestry, which included healthy controls and MDD, PD, hypertensive and POTS patients. Compared with controls, cases had significantly higher prevalence of the T allele of rs7194256 (C/T), arterial norepinephrine, depression and anxiety scores, larger left ventricular mass index, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate. Bioinformatic analysis identified that the microRNA miR-19a-3p could bind preferentially to the sequence created by the presence of the T allele. This was supported by results of luciferase assays. Compared with controls, cases had significantly lower circulating miR-19a-3p, which was associated with pathways related to blood pressure and regulation of neurotransmission. In vitro norepinephrine downregulated miR-19a-3p. In conclusion, the T allele of the rs7194256 SNP in the 3'UTR of the NET gene is more prevalent in diseases where NET impairment is evident. This might be explained by the creation of a binding site for the microRNA miR-19a-3p.

Our data provide evidence that individuals are not equally sensitive to PQ/MB and show that the motor deficits in vulnerable animals, are not only a result of DA neuron degeneration, but may also be a consequence of peripheral disabilities.

However, basal plasma norepinephrine levels did not show statistically significant differences between patients and controls. After drug therapy, plasma catecholamine levels were nonsignificantly decreased and norepinephrine levels showed a tendency toward a decrease that did not reach significance.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) have demonstrated a rather robust efficacy for the treatment of most of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless a substantial number of patients are resistant or still suffer from residual symptoms despite this first line treatment. The objective of our paper is to review relevant studies for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders resistant to the first line treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a pubmed/medline search for double-blind placebo-controlled trials of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. An adequate trial for a SRI in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should continue for at least 12 weeks. Special considerations of the comorbidities and symptom profile could help in the choice of an appropriate pharmacotherapy. Several trials have highlighted the efficacy of antipsychotics as an add-on to SRI in treatment-resistant OCD such as haloperidol more so when comorbid with a tic disorder, or risperidone that can reduce OCD as well as depressive symptoms. Aripiprazole has been shown efficacious in two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, while the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine remains controversial. Other trials showed some efficacy of anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, topiramate), pindolol, memantin and N-acetylcystein as an adjunctive treatment to SRI for resistant OCD. Few trials have investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or SNRI resistant generalized anxiety disorder showing a failure of adjunctive therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and risperidone. These studies were underpowered and very limited in number. Adjunctive risperidone for resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed benefit in some but not all trials. Olanzapine was beneficial for the reduction of the CAPS score in addition to the improvement of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, prazosin was efficacious by reducing PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and psychological distress. One double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate treatment-resistant social phobia showing no benefit of pindolol add-on paroxetine. Our results demonstrate that the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders is not sufficiently investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, despite a growing evidence in favor of antipsychotics and some other pharmacological agents in resistant OCD and, to a lesser extent, PTSD. Hence, there is a crucial need for larger double-blind placebo-controlled trials for resistant anxiety disorders. Finally, being out of the scope of our review, we omitted studies of non-pharmacologic therapies.",

        "abstract": "For many patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), first-line treatment does not lead to remission. This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in patients with GAD and an inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Patients were randomized to quetiapine XR or placebo adjunctive to SSRI/SNRIs in an 11-week study. The primary endpoint was change from randomization to week 8 in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score. Secondary variables were HAM-A psychic/somatic clusters, response, and remission, and Clinical Global Impression\u2013Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score. A total of 409 patients received quetiapine XR (n = 209) or placebo (n = 200). The week 8 mean change in HAM-A total score was not statistically significant for quetiapine XR (\u201310.74; P = .079) vs placebo (\u20139.61). Secondary variables were generally consistent with the primary analysis, except for a significant reduction in HAM-A total score (week 1) and significant improvements in HAM-A psychic cluster and CGI-S total scores (week 8). Adverse events included dry mouth, somnolence, sedation, headache, and dizziness. In patients with GAD and an inadequate response to SSRI/ SNRIs, adjunctive quetiapine XR did not show a statistically significant effect for the primary endpoint at week 8, although some secondary endpoints were statistically significant vs placebo. Quetiapine XR was generally well tolerated.",

        "title": "Stress and excitatory synapses: from health to disease.",
        "abstract": "Individuals are exposed to stressful events in their daily life. The effects of stress on brain function ranges from highly adaptive to increasing the risk to develop psychopathology. For example, stressful experiences are remembered well which can be seen as a highly appropriate behavioral adaptation. On the other hand, stress is an important risk factor, in susceptible individuals, for depression and anxiety. An important question that remains to be addressed is how stress regulates brain function and what determines the threshold between adaptive and maladaptive responses. Excitatory synapses play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and behavioral adaptation. In this review we discuss how brief and prolonged exposure to stress, in adulthood and early life, regulate the function of these synapses, and how these effects may contribute to behavioral adaptation and psychopathology.",

        "title": "Early life stress sensitizes the renal and systemic sympathetic system in rats.",
        "abstract": "We hypothesized that maternal separation (MS), an early life stress model, induces a sensitization of the sympathetic system. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the renal and systemic sympathetic system in 12- to 14-wk-old male control or MS rats with the following parameters: 1) effect of renal denervation on conscious renal filtration capacity, 2) norepinephrine (NE) content in key organs involved in blood pressure control, and 3) acute systemic pressor responses to adrenergic stimulation or ganglion blockade. MS was performed by separating pups from their mothers for 3 h/day from day 2 to 14; controls were nonhandled littermates. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was examined in renal denervated (DnX; within 2 wk) or sham rats using I\u00b9\u00b2\u2075-iothalamate plasma clearance. MS-DnX rats showed significantly increased GFR compared with MS-SHAM rats (3.8 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 ml/min, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas DnX had no effect in controls, indicating that renal nerves regulate GFR in MS rats. NE content was significantly increased in organ tissues from MS rats (P < 0.05, n = 6-8), suggesting a sensitization of the renal and systemic sympathetic system. Conscious MS rats displayed a significantly greater increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to NE (2 \u03bcg/kg ip) and a greater reduction in MAP in response to mecamylamine (2 mg/kg ip, P < 0.05, n = 4) monitored by telemetry, indicating that MS rats exhibit exaggerated responses to sympathetic stimulation. In conclusion, these data indicate that MS sensitizes the renal and systemic sympathetic system ultimately impairing blood pressure regulation.",

        "title": "Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with cortisol changes.",
        "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but its mechanism of action is largely unknown. Since DBS may induce rapid symptomatic changes and the pathophysiology of OCD has been linked to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, we set out to study whether DBS affects the HPA axis in OCD patients. We compared a stimulation ON and OFF condition with a one-week interval in 16 therapy-refractory OCD patients, treated with DBS for at least one year, targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We measured changes in 24-h urinary excretion of free cortisol (UFC), adrenaline and noradrenaline and changes in obsessive-compulsive (Y-BOCS), depressive (HAM-D) and anxiety (HAM-A) symptom scores. Median UFC levels increased with 53% in the OFF condition (from 93 to 143nmol/24h, p=0.12). There were no changes in urinary adrenaline or noradrenaline excretion. The increase in Y-BOCS (39%), and HAM-D (78%) scores correlated strongly with increased UFC levels in the OFF condition. Our findings indicate that symptom changes following DBS for OCD patients are associated with changes in UFC levels.",

        "title": "The 35% carbon dioxide test in stress and panic research: overview of effects and integration of findings.",
        "abstract": "The carbon dioxide test--a vital capacity breath of air containing 35% carbon dioxide (CO(2))--provokes panic attacks in many individuals with panic disorder (PD). It has thus been extensively used as an experimental model of panic and less frequently as a clinical method of provoking symptoms for interoceptive exposure treatment. Recently, stress researchers have suggested another use for the CO(2) test: that of an acute physiological stressor indexing the human stress response. The purpose of this review is to synthesize findings about the effects of the CO(2) test from both the panic and stress literatures in order to advance understanding about this increasingly popular test. Both panic and stress researchers have examined the fleeting effects of the CO(2) test, finding that the test engenders transient breathlessness, dizziness, and minor anxiety in most participants and panic attacks in those with or at risk for PD. Physiological measurements after the test indicate a brief homeostatic disruption in many bodily systems, including increased respiration, systolic blood pressure, and noradrenaline, and decreased heart rate. Most studies indicate increased cortisol. Possible benefits of integrating findings from the panic and stress research lines, given their common use of the CO(2) test, are discussed.",

        "title": "Does yohimbine hydrochloride facilitate fear extinction in virtual reality treatment of fear of flying? A randomized placebo-controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Research suggests that yohimbine hydrochloride (YOH), a noradrenaline agonist, can facilitate fear extinction. It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is stimulated through elevated noradrenaline levels. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the potential exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in a clinical sample of participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for a specific phobia (fear of flying). Sixty-seven participants with fear of flying were randomized to 4 sessions of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) combined with YOH (10 mg), or 4 sessions of VRET combined with a placebo. Treatment consisted of 4 weekly 1-hour exposure sessions consisting of two 25-minute virtual flights. At pre- and post- treatment, fear of flying was assessed. The YOH or placebo capsules were administered 1 h prior to exposures. The manipulation of the noradrenaline activity was confirmed by salivary \u03b1-amylase (sAA) samples taken pre-, during and post-exposure. Forty-eight participants completed treatment. Manipulation of noradrenaline levels with YOH was successful, with significantly higher levels of sAA in the YOH group when entering exposure. Results showed that both groups improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment with respect to anxiety reduction. However, although the manipulation of noradrenaline activity was successful, there was no evidence that YOH enhanced outcome. Participants improved significantly on anxiety measures independently of drug condition, after 4 sessions of VRET. These data do not support the initial findings of exposure-enhancing effects of YOH in this dosage in clinical populations.",
