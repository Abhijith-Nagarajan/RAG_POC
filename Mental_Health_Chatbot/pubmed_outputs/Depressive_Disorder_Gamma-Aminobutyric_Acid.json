        "title": "Glutamate plus glutamine to GABA ratio as a predictor of ketamine response in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, randomized, open-label extension study.",
        "abstract": "Approximately 30\u00a0% of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (\u00b1SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) with no such association in the placebo group. These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD.",

        "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13)\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.66, p\u2009=\u20090.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",

Using proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), this study aimed to determine whether lower pretreatment GABA and Glx levels in the medial frontal cortex, a region implicated in MDD pathophysiology, are associated with better antidepressant treatment response. Participants with MDD (N\u2009=\u200974) were antidepressant na\u00efve or medication-free for at least three weeks before imaging. Two MEGA-PRESS <sup>1</sup>H-MRS acquisitions were collected, interleaved with a water unsuppressed reference scan. GABA and Glx concentrations were quantified from an average difference spectrum, with preprocessing using Gannet and spectral fitting using TARQUIN. Following imaging, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks in a double-blind design. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied with treatment type and age as covariates. Bayes Factor hypothesis testing was used to interpret the strength of the evidence. No significant association was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA, or Glx/GABA and depression remission status or the continuous outcome, percent change in symptom severity. In an exploratory analysis, no significant correlation was found between pretreatment Glx, GABA or Glx/GABA and days to response. Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence towards the null hypotheses in all cases. To date, there are no replicated biomarkers in psychiatry. To address this, well-powered, placebo-controlled trials need to be undertaken and reported. The present analysis suggests pretreatment GABA, Glx, or their ratio cannot predict antidepressant treatment response.

        "abstract": "Individuals seeking treatment for their cocaine use often report depressive systems and nearly half meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). This descriptive study aimed to assess the effects of the antidepressant venlafaxine alone and in combination with gabapentin on depressive symptoms, subjective effects of cocaine, and cocaine self-administration in depressed and non-depressed people who use cocaine. The effects of medication condition on mood and on the effects of smoked cocaine were compared between a group of clinically depressed people who use cocaine (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and a control group of non-depressed people who use cocaine (n\u00a0=\u00a05) using laboratory-based measures. In the MDD group, venlafaxine (300\u00a0mg/day) was associated with reduced mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores (35 to <5) and marginally lower ratings of \"good drug effect\" without affecting cocaine \"wanting\" or cocaine (0-50\u00a0mg) self-administration. In both groups, venlafaxine treatment increased resting heart rate, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure. The addition of gabapentin (2400\u00a0mg/day) had no effect relative to venlafaxine alone for either group. Conclusions regarding venlafaxine's effectiveness in treating depression in the MDD group are tempered by the lack of a venlafaxine placebo condition and by reductions in BDI scores associated with abstinence prior to venlafaxine administration. Further research is necessary to identify effective treatments for depressed people who use cocaine.",

This study examines changes in neurotransmitters (GABA, Glx) and antioxidants (GSH) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of MDD patients under varying levels of ACTH, and their relationship with psychological and cognitive conditions. Forty-five MDD patients were divided into high-ACTH (>65\u00a0pg/mL; n\u00a0=\u00a016) and normal-ACTH (7-65\u00a0pg/mL; n\u00a0=\u00a029) groups based on blood ACTH levels, along with 12 healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent HAM-D, HAM-A assessments, and most completed MMSE and MoCA tests. GABA+, Glx, and GSH levels in the dACC were measured using the MEGA-PRESS sequence. Intergroup differences and correlations between clinical factors, HPA axis activity, and metabolites were analyzed. Compared to HC, the normal ACTH group showed higher Glx and lower GSH levels. Glx and GSH were negatively correlated with MDD severity. In the high-ACTH MDD group, Glx positively correlated with delayed memory, and GSH positively correlated with abstraction. Factors influencing GABA included ACTH levels, depression duration, and negative events. Predictive factors for HAM-D scores were GSH and GABA. The sample size is small. MDD patients exhibit neurochemical differences in the brain related to HPA axis levels, MDD severity, and cognitive function.

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a form of glial cell-based synaptic dysfunction disease in which glial cells interact closely with neuronal synapses and perform synaptic information processing. Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, are active components of the brain and are responsible for synaptic activity through the release gliotransmitters. A reduced density of astrocytes and astrocyte dysfunction have both been identified the brains of patients with MDD. Furthermore, gliotransmission, i.e., active information transfer mediated by gliotransmitters between astrocytes and neurons, is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. However, the mechanism by which astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission contributes to depression remains unknown. This review therefore summarizes the alterations in astrocytes in MDD, including astrocyte marker, connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, Cx43 gap junctions, and Cx43 hemichannels, and describes the regulatory mechanisms of astrocytes involved in synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms acting of the glutamatergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and purinergic systems that modulate synaptic function and the antidepressant mechanisms of the related receptor antagonists. Further, we summarize the roles of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, d-serine, and adenosine triphosphate in depression, providing a basis for the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for MDD.",

Though previous in vivo proton (<sup>1</sup>H) MRS) research conducted at 4\u2009T or lower has identified alterations in glutamate metabolism associated with PTSD predisposition and/or progression, no prior investigations have been conducted at higher field strength. In addition, earlier studies have not extensively addressed the impact of psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD) on PTSD-associated <sup>1</sup>H-MRS-visible brain metabolite abnormalities. Here we employ 7\u2009T <sup>1</sup>H MRS to examine concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and glutathione in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of PTSD patients with MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD+</sub>; N\u00a0=\u20096) or without MDD (PTSD+<sub>MDD-</sub>; N\u00a0=\u20095), as well as trauma-unmatched controls without PTSD but with MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD+</sub>; N\u00a0=\u20099) or without MDD (PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub>; N\u00a0=\u200918). Participants with PTSD demonstrated decreased ratios of GABA to glutamine relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls but no single-metabolite abnormalities. When comorbid MDD was considered, however, MDD but not PTSD diagnosis was significantly associated with increased mPFC glutamine concentration and decreased glutamate:glutamine ratio. In addition, all participants with PTSD and/or MDD collectively demonstrated decreased glutathione relative to healthy PTSD-<sub>MDD-</sub> controls. Despite limited findings in single metabolites, patterns of abnormality in prefrontal metabolite concentrations among individuals with PTSD and/or MDD enabled supervised classification to separate them from healthy controls with 80+% sensitivity and specificity, with glutathione, glutamine, and myoinositol consistently among the most informative metabolites for this classification.

The authors sought to address a critical gap in knowledge, namely, how stress circuitry is functionally affected by glucocorticoids and GABA in current or remitted major depressive disorder (MDD). Multimodal imaging data were collected from 130 young adults (ages 18-25), of whom 44 had current MDD, 42 had remitted MDD, and 44 were healthy comparison subjects. GABA+ (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid and macromolecules) was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and task-related functional MRI data were collected under acute stress and analyzed using data-driven network modeling. Across modalities, trait-related abnormalities emerged. Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both clinical groups were characterized by lower rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) GABA+ and frontoparietal network amplitude but higher amplitude in salience and stress-related networks. For the remitted MDD group, differences from the healthy comparison group emerged in the context of elevated cortisol levels, whereas the MDD group had lower cortisol levels than the healthy comparison group. In the comparison group, frontoparietal and stress-related network connectivity was positively associated with cortisol level (highlighting putative top-down regulation of stress), but the opposite relationship emerged in the MDD and remitted MDD groups. Finally, rACC GABA+ was associated with stress-induced changes in connectivity between overlapping default mode and salience networks. Lifetime MDD was characterized by reduced rACC GABA+ as well as dysregulated cortisol-related interactions between top-down control (frontoparietal) and threat (task-related) networks. These findings warrant further investigation of the role of GABA in the vulnerability to and treatment of MDD.",

However, previous research has not investigated the putative associations among these factors or the extent to which they represent trait- or state-based vulnerabilities for depression. Young adults with current major depressive disorder (MDD) (n\u00a0= 44), remitted MDD (n\u00a0= 42), and healthy control participants (HCs) (n\u00a0= 44), stratified by sex assigned at birth, underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess macromolecular contaminated GABA (GABA+) and then a reward learning task before and after acute stress. We assessed changes in reward learning after stress and associations with GABA+. Results revealed blunted baseline reward learning in participants with remitted MDD versus participants with current MDD and HCs but, surprisingly, no differences between participants with current MDD and HCs. Reward learning was reduced following acute stress regardless of depressive history. GABA+ in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, but not the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was associated with reduced baseline reward learning only in female participants. GABA+ did not predict stress-related changes in reward learning. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate associations among GABA, reward learning, and stress reactivity in current versus past depression. Hypothesized depression-related differences in reward learning did not emerge, precluding claims about state versus trait vulnerabilities. However, our finding that blunted GABA was associated with greater reward learning in female participants provides novel insights into sex-selective associations between the frontal GABAergic inhibitory system and reward processing.",

        "abstract": "Revealing the acute cortical pharmacodynamics of an antidepressant dose of ketamine in humans with depression is key to determining the specific mechanism(s) of action for alleviating symptoms. While the downstream effects are characterised by increases in plasticity and reductions in depressive symptoms-it is the acute response in the brain that triggers this cascade of events. Computational modelling of cortical interlaminar and cortico-cortical connectivity and receptor dynamics provide the opportunity to interrogate this question using human electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during a ketamine infusion. Here, resting-state EEG was recorded in a group of 30 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline and during a 0.44\u2009mg/kg ketamine dose comprising a bolus and infusion. Fronto-parietal connectivity was assessed using dynamic causal modelling to fit a thalamocortical model to hierarchically connected nodes in the medial prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule. We found a significant increase in parietal-to-frontal AMPA-mediated connectivity and a significant decrease in the frontal GABA time constant. Both parameter changes were correlated across participants with the antidepressant response to ketamine. Changes to the NMDA receptor time constant and inhibitory intraneuronal input into superficial pyramidal cells did not survive correction for multiple comparisons and were not correlated with the antidepressant response. These results provide evidence that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may be mediated by acute fronto-parietal connectivity and GABA receptor dynamics. Furthermore, it supports the large body of literature suggesting the acute mechanism underlying ketamine's antidepressant properties is related to GABA-A and AMPA receptors rather than NMDA receptor antagonism.",

        "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). Most GABAergic neurons synthesize GABA from glutamate and release it in the synaptic cleft in the CNS. However, astrocytes can also synthesize and release GABA, activating GABA receptors in the neighboring neurons in physiological and pathological conditions. As the primary homeostatic glial cells in the brain, astrocytes play a crucial role in regulating GABA homeostasis and synaptic neurotransmission. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that astrocytic GABA dysregulation is implicated in psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the most prevalent co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Several current medications and emerging pharmacological agents targeting GABA levels are in clinical trials for treating AUD and MDD. This review offers a concise summary of the role of astrocytic GABA regulation in AUD and MDD. We also provide an overview of the current understanding and areas of debate regarding the mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate GABA in the CNS and their potential significance in the molecular basis of AUD and MDD, paving the way toward future research directions and potential therapeutic target areas within this field.",

If multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy fail in some patients with MDD, their condition is then termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MDD can be associated with abnormalities in the reward-system-dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, in which the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) play major roles. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the NAc alleviates the depressive symptoms of MDD. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of this DBS has remained elusive. In this study, using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we investigated the behavioral and neurobiological effects of NAc-DBS on the multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by CUMS by integrating behavioral, in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), calcium imaging, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation methods in freely moving mice. We found that long-term and repeated, but not single, NAc-DBS induced robust antidepressant responses in CUMS mice. Moreover, even a single trial NAc-DBS led to the elevation of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, accompanied by the increase in dopamine (DA) neuron activity in the VTA. Both the inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity and knockdown of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-\u03b11 gene in VTA-GABA neurons blocked the antidepressant effect of NAc-DBS in CUMS mice. Our results showed that NAc-DBS could disinhibit VTA-DA neurons by regulating the level of GABA and the activity of VTA-GABA in the VTA and could finally correct the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mouse model.",

Twenty-eight patients with a major depressive episode, measured before and after participating in a clinical trial with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and 15 controls underwent [11C]flumazenil positron emission tomography to assess GABAA receptor availability and paired pulse TMS (ppTMS) to evaluate cortical excitability. Both whole-brain voxel-wise GABAA receptor availability and mean values from left hand motor cortex and left paracentral lobule were correlated to the ppTMS outcomes: short-interval intracortical inhibition reflecting GABAA receptor activity, long-interval intracortical inhibition representing GABAB receptor activity, intracortical facilitation reflecting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activity, as well as the resting motor threshold (rMT), considered a global measure of corticospinal excitability. No significant differences in baseline GABAA receptor availability or cortical excitability were found between patients and controls. Additionally, no correlations were observed between baseline measurements of GABAA receptor availability and TMS outcomes. Changes in GABAA receptor availability in the hand motor cortex, between pre- and post-assessments, were inversely related to pre-post changes in hand rMT. We found that a change in GABAA receptor availability was inversely related to a change in rMT, suggesting a link between GABA deficiency and increased rMT previously observed in depressive episodes.

There were no significant differences in neuroactive steroid levels between controls and participants with PMDD in the luteal phase (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Within the PMDD group, sertraline treatment significantly increased serum pregnanolone levels and the pregnanolone:progesterone ratio, and decreased 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-androsterone. This was the first study to assess the impact of SSRI treatment on peripheral levels of GABAergic neuroactive steroids in PMDD. Within the PMDD group, sertraline treatment was associated with a significant increase in luteal phase serum pregnanolone levels and a significantly increased pregnanolone:progesterone ratio, a novel finding. Future research should examine alterations in the metabolic pathways among GABAergic neuroactive steroids in individuals with PMDD, in a placebo-controlled design.",

        "abstract": "Type A \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are the principal inhibitory receptors in the brain and the target of a wide range of clinical agents, including anaesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics and antidepressants<sup>1-3</sup>. However, our understanding of GABA<sub>A</sub>R pharmacology has been hindered by the vast number of pentameric assemblies that can be derived from 19 different subunits<sup>4</sup> and the lack of structural knowledge of clinically relevant receptors. Here, we isolate native murine GABA<sub>A</sub>R assemblies containing the widely expressed \u03b11 subunit and elucidate their structures in complex with drugs used to treat insomnia (zolpidem\u00a0(ZOL) and flurazepam) and postpartum depression (the neurosteroid allopregnanolone\u00a0(APG)). Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)\u00a0analysis and single-molecule photobleaching experiments, we uncover three major structural populations in the brain: the canonical \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 receptor containing two \u03b11 subunits, and two assemblies containing one \u03b11 and either an \u03b12 or \u03b13 subunit, in which the single \u03b11-containing receptors feature a more compact arrangement between the transmembrane and extracellular domains. Interestingly, APG is bound at the transmembrane \u03b1/\u03b2 subunit interface, even when not added to the sample, revealing an important role for endogenous neurosteroids in modulating native GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Together with structurally engaged lipids, neurosteroids produce global conformational changes throughout the receptor that modify the ion channel pore and the binding sites for GABA and insomnia medications. Our data reveal the major \u03b11-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R assemblies, bound with endogenous neurosteroid, thus defining a structural landscape from which subtype-specific drugs can be developed.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder that afflicts ~17% of the world population. Neuroimaging investigations of depressed patients have consistently reported the dysfunction of the basolateral amygdala in the pathophysiology of depression. However, how the BLA and related circuits are implicated in the pathogenesis of depression is poorly understood. Here, we combined fiber photometry, immediate early gene expression (c-fos), optogenetics, chemogenetics, behavioral analysis, and viral tracing techniques to provide multiple lines of evidence of how the BLA neurons mediate depressive-like behavior. We demonstrated that the aversive stimuli elevated the neuronal activity of the excitatory BLA neurons (BLA<sup>CAMKII</sup> neurons). Optogenetic activation of CAMKII neurons facilitates the induction of depressive-like behavior while inhibition of these neurons alleviates the depressive-like behavior. Next, we found that the chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the BLA (BLA<sup>GABA</sup> ) increased the firing frequency of CAMKII neurons and mediates the depressive-like phenotypes. Finally, through fiber photometry recording and chemogenetic manipulation, we proved that the activation of BLA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons inhibits BLA<sup>CAMKII</sup> neuronal activity and alleviates depressive-like behavior in the mice. Thus, through evaluating BLA<sup>GABA</sup> and BLA<sup>CAMKII</sup> neurons by distinct interaction, the BLA regulates depressive-like behavior.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews novel neurosteroid therapeutics for post-partum depression, with a focus on their development, clinical trial data, current practices, and future directions in this exciting field. We discuss the clinical impact of brexanolone and several other neurosteroids, particularly as they relate to the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) and major depressive disorders outside of the perinatal period. There has been increasing interest in GABA signaling and modulation as it pertains to the development of altered circuity and depressive states. This scientific underpinning served as the rationale for the initial development of brexanolone. We review the clinical trials supporting its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as the first rapidly acting antidepressant specific for PPD, and the subsequent development of a clinical brexanolone program at an academic medical center, highlighting new research and data from that site as well as the challenges with the delivery of this I.V. drug. In addition to the GABA signaling hypothesis, we discuss the new evidence demonstrating that brexanolone inhibits inflammatory signaling post-infusion, suggesting that inflammatory signaling may contribute to the etiology of PPD. Finally, we describe new and future directions in neurosteroid therapeutics, including the development of an oral agent, zuranolone, and the IV and oral formulations of ganaxolone. Ultimately, the hope is that these novel neurosteroid therapeutics will provide fast-acting treatment for these impairing disorders and improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of depressive disorders.",

        "abstract": "The lack of biomarkers to monitor and predict the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has hindered its optimal use. To establish metabolomic markers for monitoring and predicting the treatment efficacy of ECT, we comprehensively evaluated metabolite levels in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by performing targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses using plasma samples before and after the first, third, and final ECT sessions, and 3-7\u00a0days after the final session. We compared the plasma metabolomes of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Thirteen hospitalized patients with MDD and their corresponding HCs were included in this study. We observed that patients with MDD exhibited lower levels of amino acids, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and metabolites involved in tryptophan metabolism and the kynurenine pathway, and higher levels of cortisol at baseline. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between metabolite levels and depression severity across seven measurement timepoints along with one correlation analysis and found that amino acids, including GABA and tryptophan catabolites, were significantly correlated with the severity of depression. Despite the exploratory nature of this study due to the limited sample size necessitating further validation, our findings suggest that the blood metabolic profile has potential as a biomarker for ECT.",

        "abstract": "In the past 20 years, our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression has evolved from a focus on an imbalance of monoaminergic neurotransmitters to a multifactorial picture including an improved understanding of the role of glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. FDA-approved treatments targeting the glutamatergic [esketamine for major depressive disorder (MDD)] and GABAergic (brexanolone for peripartum depression) systems have become available. This review focuses on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) system as a target for novel antidepressants and discusses the mechanisms by which modulation of \u03b4-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with neuroactive steroids (NASs) or of \u03b15-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs results in antidepressant or antidepressant-like actions and discusses clinical data on NASs. Moreover, a potential mechanism by which \u03b15-GABA<sub>A</sub>R-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) may improve cognitive deficits in depression is presented.",

        "title": "GABA-ergic Modulators: New Therapeutic Approaches to Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.",
        "abstract": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is characterized by the predictable onset of mood and physical symptoms secondary to gonadal steroid fluctuation during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Although menstrual-related affective dysfunction is responsible for considerable functional impairment and reduction in quality of life worldwide, currently approved treatments for PMDD are suboptimal in their effectiveness. Research over the past two decades has suggested that the interaction between allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid derivative of progesterone, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system represents an important relationship underlying symptom genesis in reproductive-related mood disorders, including PMDD. The objective of this narrative review is to discuss the plausible link between changes in GABAergic transmission secondary to the fluctuation of allopregnanolone during the luteal phase and mood impairment in susceptible individuals. As part of this discussion, we explore promising findings from early clinical trials of several compounds that stabilize allopregnanolone signaling during the luteal phase, including dutasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor; isoallopregnanolone, a GABA-A modulating steroid antagonist; and ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator. We then reflect on the implications of these therapeutic advances, including how they may promote our knowledge of affective regulation more generally. We conclude that these and other studies of PMDD may yield critical insight into the etiopathogenesis of affective disorders, considering that (1) symptoms in PMDD have a predictable onset and offset, allowing for examination of affective state kinetics, and (2) GABAergic interventions in PMDD can be used to better understand the relationship between mood states, network regulation, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Sedatives promote calmness or sleepiness during surgery or severely stressful events. In addition, depression is a mental health issue that negatively affects emotional well-being. A group of drugs called anti-depressants is used to treat major depressive illnesses. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of quercetin (QUR) and linalool (LIN) on thiopental sodium (TS)-induced sleeping mice and to investigate the combined effects of these compounds using a conventional co-treatment strategy and <i>in silico</i> studies. For this, the TS-induced sleeping mice were monitored to compare the occurrence, latency, and duration of the sleep-in response to QUR (10, 25, 50 mg/kg), LIN (10, 25, 50 mg/kg), and diazepam (DZP, 3 mg/kg, i.p.). Moreover, an in silico investigation was undertaken to assess this study's putative modulatory sedation mechanism. For this, we observed the ability of test and standard medications to interact with various gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>) subunits. Results revealed that QUR and LIN cause dose-dependent antidepressant-like and sedative-like effects in animals, respectively. In addition, QUR-50 mg/kg and LIN-50 mg/kg and/or DZP-3 mg/kg combined were associated with an increased latency period and reduced sleeping times in animals. Results of the in silico studies demonstrated that QUR has better binding interaction with GABA<sub>A</sub> \u03b13, \u03b21, and \u03b32 subunits when compared with DZP, whereas LIN showed moderate affinity with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Taken together, the sleep duration of LIN and DZP is opposed by QUR in TS-induced sleeping mice, suggesting that QUR may be responsible for providing sedation-antagonizing effects through the GABAergic interaction pathway.",

        "abstract": "The excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is an important molecular pathological feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) as altered GABA and glutamate levels have been found in multiple brain regions in patients. Healthy subjects show topographic organization of the E/I balance (EIB) across various brain regions. We here raise the question of whether such EIB topography is altered in MDD. Therefore, we systematically review the gene and protein expressions of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic signaling-related molecules in postmortem MDD brain studies as proxies for EIB topography. Searches were conducted through PubMed and 45 research articles were finally included. We found: i) brain-wide GABA- and glutamatergic alterations; ii) attenuated GABAergic with enhanced glutamatergic signaling in the cortical-subcortical limbic system; iii) that GABAergic signaling is decreased in regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) while it is increased in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). These together demonstrate abnormal GABA- and glutamatergic signaling-based EIB topographies in MDD. This enhances our pathophysiological understanding of MDD and carries important therapeutic implications for stimulation treatment.",
