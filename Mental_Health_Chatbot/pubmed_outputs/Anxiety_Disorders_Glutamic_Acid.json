        "abstract": "The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit is closely related to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The caudate nucleus and thalamus are the critical hubs of the CSTC circuit; however, few studies have explored the correlation between the neurochemical changes of subcortical nuclei and the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the CSTC circuit in OCD patients. In this study, 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) acquisition. The bilateral caudate nucleus and thalamus were used as the regions of interest (ROIs) for ROI-to-ROI rsFC analysis within CSTC circuit and Glu/GABA calculation to explore altered metabolite concentration in the subcortical nuclei and its correlation with rsFC. A significant increase of Glu in the left thalamus (Thalamus_L), an increase of Glu/GABA in the right thalamus (Thalamus_R), and a decrease of GABA in Thalamus_R were observed in the OCD patients compared to HCs. The rsFC showed widespread reductions among CSTC core nodes (caudate-thalamus-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between left caudate Glu levels and left caudate-right OFC rsFC. These findings provided the new evidence of glutamatergic modulation in this pathway's functional integration.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the combination of functional state magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) and cognitive tasks was used to conduct subgroup analyses on early-onset OCD (EO) and non-early-onset OCD (non-EO) and explore differences in the glutamatergic system and cognitive function among OCD subtypes. A total of 70 OCD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical evaluation and were subsequently divided into the EO or non-EO groups. Next, both resting and functional state MRS data were collected, with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) serving as the region of interest. Quantitative analysis of MRS data yielded precise neurometabolic concentrations, which were then statistically analyzed alongside inhibitory function, as measured by the Go-nogo task. The final analysis included 92 participants (22 EO-OCD, 41 non-EO OCD, and 29 HCs). EO-OCD patients had significantly higher Glx levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044) and lower GSH levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) in the functional state compared to the non-EO group. Moreover, in the EO group, correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the functional state Glx levels and the average response time for errors in the nogo task (r\u00a0=\u00a00.526, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Additionally, resting-state GSH levels were positively correlated with total Y-BOCS scores (r\u00a0=\u00a00.854, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Overall, early-onset OCD may represent a distinct subtype that requires targeted interventions, as evidenced by the imbalance in the glutamatergic system observed in early-onset OCD patients. Additionally, in early-onset patients, Glx concentration during activation was related to cognitive impairment.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is linked with dysfunction in frontal-striatal, fronto-limbic, and visual brain regions. Research using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) suggests that altered neurometabolite levels, like glutamate, may contribute to this dysfunction. However, static neurometabolite levels in OCD patients have shown inconsistent results, likely due to previous studies' limited focus on neurometabolite dynamics. We employ functional MRS (fMRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore these dynamics and brain activation during OCD symptom provocation. We utilized a combined 7-tesla fMRI-fMRS setup to examine task-related BOLD response and glutamate changes in the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) of 30 OCD participants and 34 matched controls during an OCD-specific symptom provocation task. The study examined main effects and between-group differences in brain activation and glutamate levels during the task. A whole sample task-effects analysis on data meeting predefined quality criteria showed significant glutamate increases (n\u00a0=\u00a041 (22 OCD, 19 controls), mean change: 3.2\u00a0%, z\u00a0=\u00a03.75, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and task activation (n\u00a0=\u00a054 (26 OCD, 28 controls), p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) in the LOC during OCD blocks compared to neutral blocks. However, no differences in task-induced glutamate dynamics or activation between groups were found, nor a correlation between glutamate levels and task activation. We were able to measure task-induced increases in glutamate and BOLD levels, emphasizing its feasibility for OCD research. The absence of group differences highlights the need for further exploration to discern to what extent neurometabolite dynamics differ between OCD patients and controls. Once established, future studies can use pre-post intervention fMRS-fMRI to probe the effects of therapies modulating glutamate pathways in OCD.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial antioxidant in the human brain. Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy sequence is highly recommended, limited literature has measured cortical GSH using this method in major psychiatric disorders. By combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we quantified brain GSH and glutamate in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus and explored relationships between GSH levels and intrinsic neuronal activity as well as clinical symptoms among healthy control (HC) participants (n\u00a0= 30), people with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n\u00a0= 28), and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (n\u00a0= 28). GSH concentrations were lower in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in both the MDD and OCD groups than in the HC group. In the HC group, positive correlations were noted between GSH and glutamate levels and between GSH and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in both regions. However, while these correlations were absent in both patient groups, there was a weak positive correlation between glutamate and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Moreover, GSH levels were negatively correlated with depressive and compulsive symptoms in MDD and OCD, respectively. These findings suggest that reduced GSH levels and an imbalance between GSH and glutamate could increase oxidative stress and alter neurotransmitter signaling, thereby leading to disruptions in GSH-related neurochemical-neuronal coupling and psychopathologies across MDD and OCD. Understanding these mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the processes that underlie these disorders and potentially become a springboard for future directions and advancing our knowledge of their neurobiological foundations.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, glutamate has emerged as a prominent focus in the field of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) pathophysiology. A convergence of evidence from genetic, preclinical, and clinical studies points to glutamatergic dysfunction as a key feature of this condition. In light of these findings, there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of glutamatergic agents in the treatment of OCD. This paper reviews the literature on glutamate transmission in OCD. In addition, the authors examine the results of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of glutamatergic agents in the treatment of OCD patients. Along with the recognition of neuroinflammation in the brain in OCD, the evidence of glutamate dysfunction represents one of the most promising recent discoveries for understanding the mechanisms involved in OCD. The importance of this discovery lies primarily in its pharmacological implications and has led to intense research activity in the field of glutamatergic agents. While this research has not yet had a substantial clinical impact, targeting glutamate receptors remains a promising horizon for the successful treatment of OCD patients.",

Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in the orbitofrontal cortex Glx/Cr and NAA/Cr levels between the OCD patients and the control group. OCD patients exhibited a decrease in NAA/Cr levels, consistent with impaired neuronal integration, and an increase in Glx/Cr levels, consistent with hyperactivation, in the caudate nucleus compared to the control group. We observed a negative correlation between NAA/Cr levels in the caudate nucleus and the levels of SOD and GPx. Our study is the first to assess CN and OFC together in OCD patients using 3\u00a0T MR, investigating the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and oxidative stress parameters. The negative correlation we observed between NAA/Cr levels and SOD and GPx in the caudate nucleus suggests that increased oxidative stress in this brain region in OCD patients may contribute to impaired neuronal integration and functionality.",

In the statistical analysis, we compared differences between groups for the metabolites; in the OCD we analyzed the correlations with symptom severity, medication status, age, and duration of illness. A significant decrease in Glx, in Glu, and in Gln in the pgACC were observed in the OCD compared to HC. The correlation statistics showed a significant positive correlation between Glu levels and the YBOCS compulsions subscale.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate efficacy of rTMS treatment in alleviating related symptoms and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) neurometabolites. OCD patients were randomly divided into either drug (n\u00a0=\u00a023) or drug\u00a0+\u00a0rTMS (n\u00a0=\u00a029) groups, and those in the latter group subjected to 4-week rTMS treatment.

Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by structural and functional deficits in the cortico-striato-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry and abnormal neurochemical changes are thought to modulate these deficits. The hypothesis that an imbalanced concentration of the brain neurotransmitters, in particular glutamate (Glu) and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), could impair the normal functioning of the CSTC, thus leading to OCD symptoms, has been tested in humans using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomography (PET). This chapter summarises these neurochemical findings and represents an attempt to condense such scattered literature. We also discuss potential challenges in the field that may explain the inconsistent findings and suggest ways to overcome them. There is some convergent research from MRS pointing towards abnormalities in the brain concentration of neurometabolite markers of neuronal integrity, such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho). Lower NAA levels have been found in dorsal and rostral ACC of OCD patients (as compared to healthy volunteers), which increase after CBT and SSRI treatment, and higher Cho concentration has been reported in the thalamus of the OCD brain. However, findings for other neurometabolites are very inconsistent. Studies have reported abnormalities in the concentrations of creatine (Cr), GABA, glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), Ins (myo-inositol), and serotonin (5-HT), but most of the results were not replicated. The question remains whether the NAA and Cho findings are genuinely the only neurochemical abnormalities in OCD or whether the lack of consistent findings for the other neurometabolites is caused by the lower magnetic field (1-3 Tesla (T)) used by the studies conducted so far, their small sample sizes or a lack of proper control for medication effects. To answer these questions and to further inform the biological underpinning of the symptoms and the cognitive problems at the basis of OCD we need better controlled studies using clear medicated vs unmedicated groups, larger sample sizes, stronger magnetic fields (e.g. at 7\u00a0T), and more consistency in the definition of the regions of interest.",

In all OCD patients, glutamate was negatively correlated with scores of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (<i>r</i>=-0.55, <i>P</i>=0.002). Moreover, the ACC glutamate of female patients was correlated with the total score of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (<i>r</i>=0.69, <i>P</i>=0.041) in the OCD with comorbid SPD patients. Alterations of the glutamate content in the ACC are involved in the pathophysiological process of OCD with comorbid SPD, which provides evidence for the study on the pathogenesis of OCD and SPD.",

        "title": "Thin graphene oxide nanoflakes modulate glutamatergic synapses in the amygdala cultured circuits: Exploiting synaptic approaches to anxiety disorders.",
        "abstract": "Anxiety disorders (ADs) are nervous system maladies involving changes in the amygdala synaptic circuitry, such as an upregulation of excitatory neurotransmission at glutamatergic synapses. In the field of nanotechnology, thin graphene oxide flakes with nanoscale lateral size (s-GO) have shown outstanding promise for the manipulation of excitatory neuronal transmission with high temporal and spatial precision, thus they were considered as ideal candidates for modulating amygdalar glutamatergic transmission. Here, we validated an in vitro model of amygdala circuitry as a screening tool to target synapses, towards development of future ADs treatments. After one week in vitro, dissociated amygdalar neurons reconnected forming functional networks, whose development recapitulated that of the tissue of origin. When acutely applied to these cultures, s-GO flakes induced a selective modification of excitatory activity. This type of interaction between s-GO and amygdalar neurons may form the basis for the exploitation of alternative approaches in the treatment of ADs.",

        "abstract": "Mood disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, in particular, appear to be some of the most common psychiatric disorders with a high rate of comorbidity most frequently of anxiety or substance abuse disorders (alcohol use disorder). In both cases - MDD and AUD, a number of immunological disturbances are observed, such as chronic mild inflammation response, increased level of cytokines, hypercortisolaemia, which lead to specific changes in brain neurotransmitter functions. Some of the contemporary brain imaging techniques are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic spectroscopy which are most commonly used to assess the brain metabolism and functional connectivity changes such as altered responses to emotional stimuli in MDD or overactivation of ventromedial prefrontal areas during delayed and underactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal regions during impulsive reward decisions in AUD and dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or glutamate neurotransmitter systems, low NAA and myo-Inositol in both MDD and AUD.",

        "title": "Reduced anterior cingulate glutamate of comorbid skin-picking disorder in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
        "abstract": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by hyperactivity in a network of forebrain structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Convergent evidence suggests that glutamatergic dysfunction may contribute to the disorder. Skin picking disorder (SPD) was listed as one of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, which is often comorbid with OCD and share overlapping phenomenology and pathophysiology. However, potential confounding effects between the two diagnostic effects on neurotransmitter levels remain largely unexamined. We examined the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) glutamate and other neurochemicals in 62 subjects using a single-voxel acquisition 1H MRS at 3Tesla; of these, 47 subjects yielded usable measurements of both glutamate and glutamine and were included in the analysis (17 medicated with OCD alone, 13 medicated with comorbid OCD\u00a0+\u00a0SPD, 17 healthy control). OCD with comorbid SPD showed significantly lower pACC glutamate than in patients without SPD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) or control subjects (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). OCD without SPD subjects showed pACC glutamate levels indistinguishable from controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.501). In the OCD with SPD subjects, glutamate was correlated with Y-BOCS total score in female patients (n\u00a0=\u00a09, r\u00a0=\u00a00.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041). The main limitation of the study was the cross-sectional data. Our patients were on SSRI medication which may have modified the effect of SPD and OCD interaction on glutamate activity. Our results suggest that alterations of the glutamatergic system may play an important role in the pathophysiology of a subgroup of OCD and reduced pACC glutamate may be a biomarker of a distinct subset of OCD patients.",

        "title": "Effects of glutamate-related drugs on anxiety and compulsive behavior in rats with obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
        "abstract": "<b>Objective</b>: Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We examined the effects and potential mechanism of glutamate-related drugs on compulsive behavior in quinpirole (QNP)-sensitized rats, to deepen our understanding of the link between OCD and glutamate.<b>Method</b>: This study systematically compared the effects of the partial NMDA agonist D-Cycloserine and the NMDA antagonist NVP-AAMO77, Ro25-6981 on compulsive behavior using the elevated zero maze, open field, and marble burying tests in QNP-induced OCD model.<b>Results</b>: The competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists NVP-AAMO77 (5\u2009mg/kg) and Ro25-6981 (5\u2009mg/kg) significantly inhibited anxiety-like and compulsive behavior in rats. And D-Cycloserine at all doses showed significant suppression on anxiety-like and marble-burying behavior. Glutamic acid (Glu) levels, reflecting changes in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, were significantly decreased in rat hippocampus of the NVP-AAMO77 and D-Cycloserine-treated group compared to the saline-treated group. The levels of other amino acids were unaffected. Moreover, NVP-AAMO77 significantly decreased the expression of the subunit NR2A of the NMDAR, and Ro25-6981 suppressed the level of the subunit NR2B of the NMDAR, while D-Cycloserine decreased both the subunit NR2A and NR2B of the NMDAR.<b>Conclusion</b>: Collectively, these findings suggest a functional role of NMDARs in anxiety and compulsive behaviors, with NMDARs inhibition promoting anxiolytic-like and anti-compulsive responses. These findings suggest that D-cycloserine, NVP-AAMO77, and Ro25-6981 could be useful drugs for the treatment of OCD, which may be due to the suppression of NR2A- or NR2B- containing NMDAR.",

        "title": "Is glutamate associated with fear extinction and cognitive behavior therapy outcome in OCD? A pilot study.",
        "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure and response prevention is a well-established treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is based on the principles of fear extinction. Fear extinction is linked to structural and functional variability in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and has been consistently associated with glutamate neurotransmission. The relationship between vmPFC glutamate and fear extinction and its effects on CBT outcome have not yet been explored in adults with OCD. We assessed glutamate levels in the vmPFC using 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and fear extinction (learning and recall) using skin conductance responses during a 2-day experimental paradigm in OCD patients (n\u2009=\u200917) and in healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u200913). Obsessive-compulsive patients (n\u2009=\u200912) then received manualized CBT. Glutamate in the vmPFC was negatively associated with fear extinction recall and positively associated with CBT outcome (with higher glutamate levels predicting a better outcome) in OCD patients. Glutamate levels in the vmPFC in OCD patients were not significantly different from those in HC, and were not associated with OCD severity. Our results suggest that glutamate in the vmPFC is associated with fear extinction recall and CBT outcome in adult OCD patients.",

        "title": "Association between prefrontal glutamine levels and neuroticism determined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",
        "abstract": "There is growing evidence for GABA and glutamate-glutamine dysfunction in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders. It is important to study this pathology in the early phases of the illness in order to develop new approaches to secondary prevention. New magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures allow determining glutamine, the principal metabolite of synaptic glutamate that is directly related to glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft, as well as glutamate and GABA. In contrast to previous investigations, this study used community-based recruitment methods and a combined categorical and dimensional approach to psychopathology. In the study protocol, neuroticism was defined as the primary outcome. Neuroticism shares a large proportion of its genetic variance with mood and anxiety disorders. We examined young adult participants recruited from the general population in a cross-sectional study using 3-T 1H-MRS with one voxel in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The total sample of N\u2009=\u2009110 (61 females) included 18 individuals suffering from MDD and 19 individuals suffering from DSM-IV anxiety disorders. We found that glutamine and glutamine-to-glutamate ratio were correlated with neuroticism in the whole sample (r\u2009=\u20090.263, p\u2009=\u20090.005, and n\u2009=\u2009110; respectively, r\u2009=\u20090.252, p\u2009=\u20090.008, and n\u2009=\u2009110), even when controlling for depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses (for glutamine: beta\u2009=\u20090.220, p\u2009=\u20090.047, and n\u2009=\u2009110). Glutamate and GABA were not significantly correlated with neuroticism (r\u2009=\u20090.087, p\u2009=\u20090.365, and n\u2009=\u2009110; r\u2009=\u2009-0.044, p\u2009=\u20090.645, and n\u2009=\u2009110). Lack of self-confidence and emotional instability were the clinical correlates of glutamate-glutamine dysfunction. In conclusion, this study suggests that prefrontal glutamine is increased in early phases of mood and anxiety disorders. Further understanding of glutamate-glutamine dysfunction in stress-related disorders may lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat these disorders.",
