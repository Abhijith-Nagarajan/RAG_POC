        "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are implicated in the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), though findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and rTMS outcomes remains largely unexplored. In this study, GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were measured using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS MEGA-PRESS sequence in 42 patients with bipolar or unipolar depression, both before and after a sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involving intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A subset of 28 patients also underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) to measure whole-brain GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability and mean receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and dACC. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-rated Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S). The results indicated no significant changes in neurotransmitter levels or GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability post-iTBS in either the active or sham conditions. However, changes in MADRS-S scores after active iTBS were positively correlated with changes in GABA levels in the dACC (r(13)\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.66, p\u2009=\u20090.02). These correlations were absent in the sham group. The findings suggest that a reduction in GABA within targeted frontostriatal circuits can be part of the antidepressant mechanism of iTBS, challenging previous research. Additionally, they indicate a potential predictive role for frontostriatal GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor availability in the treatment of depression using dorsomedial prefrontal iTBS.",

We utilized <sup>1</sup>H-MRS technology to assess the metabolite levels in 53 individuals with BD (32 in depressive phase, 21 in manic phase) and 34 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline. After 6\u2009months of medication treatment, 40 subjects underwent a follow-up scan in euthymic state. Metabolite levels, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), and Glutamine (Gln), were measured in the mPFC. Patients experiencing depressive and manic episodes exhibited a notable reduction in NAA/Cr\u2009+\u2009PCr ratios at baseline compared to healthy controls (p\u2009=\u20090.004; p\u2009=\u20090.006) in baseline, compared with HCs.

The current study aims to explore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate and <i>\u03b3</i>-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in hubs of the DMN during the euthymic patients with BD (euBD). Thirty-four euBD and 55 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to the study. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), glutamate (with PRESS sequence) and GABA levels (with MEGAPRESS sequence) were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Measured concentrations of excitatory glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and inhibitory GABA were used to calculate the excitatory/inhibitory (<i>E</i>/<i>I</i>) ratio. Executive and attentional functions were respectively assessed using the Wisconsin card-sorting test and continuous performance test. euBD performed worse on attentional function than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Compared to controls, euBD had higher <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratios in the PCC (<i>p</i> = 0.023), mainly driven by a higher Glx level in the PCC of euBD (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Only in the BD group, a marginally significant negative association between the mPFC <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> ratio (Glx/GABA) and executive function was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.068). Disturbed E/I balance, particularly elevated Glx/GABA ratio in PCC is observed in euBD. The <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> balance in hubs of DMN may serve as potential biomarkers for euBD, which may also contribute to their poorer executive function.",

        "abstract": "A primary goal of psychiatry is to better understand the pathways that link genetic risk to psychiatric symptoms. Here, we tested association of diagnosis and endophenotypes with overall and neurotransmitter pathway-specific polygenic risk in patients with early-stage psychosis. Subjects included 205 demographically diverse cases with a psychotic disorder who underwent comprehensive psychiatric and neurological phenotyping and 115 matched controls. Following genotyping, we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS summary statistics. To test if overall genetic risk can be partitioned into affected neurotransmitter pathways, we calculated pathway PGSs (pPGSs) for SZ risk affecting each of four major neurotransmitter systems: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. Psychosis subjects had elevated SZ PGS versus controls; cases with SZ or BP diagnoses had stronger SZ or BP risk, respectively. There was no significant association within psychosis cases between individual symptom measures and overall PGS. However, neurotransmitter-specific pPGSs were moderately associated with specific endophenotypes; notably, glutamate was associated with SZ diagnosis and with deficits in cognitive control during task-based fMRI, while dopamine was associated with global functioning. Finally, unbiased endophenotype-driven clustering identified three diagnostically mixed case groups that separated on primary deficits of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognitive control. All clusters showed strong genome-wide risk. Cluster 2, characterized by deficits in cognitive control and negative symptoms, additionally showed specific risk concentrated in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways. Due to the intensive characterization of our subjects, the present study was limited to a relatively small cohort. As such, results should be followed up with additional research at the population and mechanism level. Our study suggests pathway-based PGS analysis may be a powerful path forward to study genetic mechanisms driving psychiatric endophenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Evidence from diverse areas of research including chronobiology, metabolomics and magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicate that energy dysregulation is a central feature of bipolar disorder pathophysiology. In this paper, we propose that mania represents a condition of heightened cerebral energy metabolism facilitated by hyperglycolysis and glutaminolysis. When oxidative glucose metabolism becomes impaired in the brain, neurons can utilize glutamate as an alternative substrate to generate energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis in astrocytes fuels the formation of denovo glutamate, which can be used as a mitochondrial fuel source in neurons via transamination to alpha-ketoglutarate and subsequent reductive carboxylation to replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Upregulation of glycolysis and glutaminolysis in this manner causes the brain to enter a state of heightened metabolism and excitatory activity which we propose to underlie the subjective experience of mania. Under normal conditions, this mechanism serves an adaptive function to transiently upregulate brain metabolism in response to acute energy demand. However, when recruited in the long term to counteract impaired oxidative metabolism it may become a pathological process. In this article, we develop these ideas in detail, present supporting evidence and propose this as a novel avenue of investigation to understand the biological basis for mania.",

        "abstract": "Lithium is regarded as the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), a severe and disabling mental health\u00a0disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. Nevertheless, lithium is not consistently effective, with only 30% of patients showing a favorable response to treatment. To provide personalized treatment options for bipolar patients, it is essential to identify prediction biomarkers such as polygenic scores. In this study, we developed a polygenic score for lithium treatment response (Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub>) in patients with BD. To gain further insights into lithium's possible molecular mechanism of action, we performed a genome-wide gene-based analysis. Using polygenic score modeling, via methods incorporating Bayesian regression and continuous shrinkage priors, Li<sup>+</sup><sub>PGS</sub> was developed in the International Consortium of Lithium Genetics cohort (ConLi<sup>+</sup>Gen: N\u2009=\u20092367) and replicated in the combined PsyCourse (N\u2009=\u200989) and BipoLife (N\u2009=\u2009102) studies.

While there has been an increase in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies examining this neurotransmission system, the results are inconsistent. Possible reasons for the inconsistency, including clinical features such as mood state and childhood versus adulthood age, were not addressed in previous meta-analyses. This systematic review and meta-analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of BD included 40 studies, with 1135 patients with BD and 964 healthy control (HC) subjects. Glutamate plus glutamine and glutamine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with BD were significantly elevated compared with those of HC subjects (standardized mean difference\u00a0= 0.42, 0.48, respectively). Subgroup analyses showed that adult BD patients had significantly higher levels of glutamate plus glutamine than adult HC subjects, but this was not the case in pediatric patients. For mood states, anterior cingulate cortex glutamate plus glutamine levels were higher in patients with bipolar depression than those in HC subjects. Our results imply that glutamatergic dysfunction in the anterior cingulate cortex may be implicated in the pathophysiology of BD, which is most evident in adult BD patients and patients with bipolar depression.",

        "abstract": "Lithium is a mood stabilizer broadly used to prevent and treat symptoms of mania and depression in people with bipolar disorder (BD). Little is known, however, about its mode of action. Here, we analyzed the impact of lithium on synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling at presynaptic terminals releasing glutamate, a neurotransmitter previously implicated in BD and other neuropsychiatric conditions. We used the pHluorin-based synaptic tracer vGpH and a fully automated image processing pipeline to quantify the effect of lithium on both SV exocytosis and endocytosis in hippocampal neurons. We found that lithium selectively reduces SV exocytic rates during electrical stimulation, and markedly slows down SV recycling post-stimulation. Analysis of single-bouton responses revealed the existence of functionally distinct excitatory synapses with varying sensitivity to lithium-some terminals show responses similar to untreated cells, while others are markedly impaired in their ability to recycle SVs. While the cause of this heterogeneity is unclear, these data indicate that lithium interacts with the SV machinery and influences glutamate release in a large fraction of excitatory synapses. Together, our findings show that lithium down modulates SV cycling, an effect consistent with clinical reports indicating hyperactivation of glutamate neurotransmission in BD.",

Nowadays a change of perspective is taking place. The glutamate system is increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The evidence spans from animal, post-mortem, imaging, pharmacological and genome-wide association studies. Bipolar disorder has been recently re-conceptualized as a synaptic plasticity-related disorder rather than simply as a result of deficits or excesses in individual neurotransmitters. A paradigm shift from a monoamine hypothesis to a neuroplasticity hypothesis focused on glutamate may represent a substantial advancement in the research for new drugs and therapies. In this review we summarize data from clinical and pre-clinical studies that have addressed glutamatergic alterations in bipolar disorder. Along with an in-depth discussion of glutamatergic alterations in bipolar disorder, we also report available data on the neuroprotective and neuroplastic potential of the classic mood stabilizers, ketamine, and psychedelics.

Here we explored the effects of TSD\u00a0+\u00a0LT on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) glutamate and/or glutamine+glutamate (Glx) levels. We studied single voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measures of DLPFC Glu and Glx levels of 48 healthy participants and 55 inpatients with a major depressive episode in course of Bipolar Disorder, a subset of which (N\u00a0=\u00a023) underwent three cycles of repeated TSD\u00a0+\u00a0LT and were evaluated before and after treatment. Treatment effects of mood and on Glu and Glx concentrations were analyzed in the context of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), correcting for age, sex and ongoing lithium treatment. Higher concentration of Glu (adjusted Z\u00a0=\u00a0-2189, p\u00a0=\u00a00,0285) and Glx (adjusted Z\u00a0=\u00a0-3,13, p\u00a0=\u00a00,0017) were observed in BD patients compared to HC.

The PubMed online database was searched for studies published between 2010 and 2021. After careful screening, 401 studies were included. The findings point to decreased levels of glutamate in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in both SZ and BD, whereas Glx is elevated in the Hippocampus in SZ and MDD. With regard to WM abnormalities, the Corpus Callosum and superior Longitudinal Fascicle were the most consistently identified brain regions showing decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) across all the reviewed disorders, except GAD. Additionally, the Uncinate Fasciculus displayed decreased FA in all disorders, except OCD. Decreased FA was also found in the inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Thalamic Radiation, and Corona Radiata in SZ, BD, and MDD. Decreased FA in the Fornix and Corticospinal Tract were found in BD and SZ patients. The Cingulum and Anterior Limb of Internal Capsule exhibited decreased FA in MDD and SZ patients. The results suggest a gradual increase in severity from GAD to SZ defined by the number of brain regions with WM abnormality which may be partially caused by abnormal glutamate levels.

The present manuscript represents the primary report of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover (1-week/condition), multimodal-MRI (proton-MR spectroscopy, functional MRI) pilot study of gabapentin (1200\u2009mg/day) in BD\u2009+\u2009CUD (n\u00a0=\u200922). Primary analyses revealed that (1) gabapentin was well tolerated and adherence and retention were high, (2) gabapentin increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right basal ganglia (rBG) glutamate levels and (3) gabapentin increased activation to visual cannabis cues in the posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC, a region involved in response inhibition to rewarding stimuli). Exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes further found that in participants taking gabapentin versus placebo, (1) elevations of dACC GABA levels were associated with lower manic/mixed and depressive symptoms and (2) elevations of rBG glutamate levels and pMCC activation to cannabis cues were associated with lower cannabis use. Though promising, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution due to observed randomization order effects on dACC glutamate levels and identification of statistical moderators that differed by randomization order (i.e. cigarette-smoking status on rBG glutamate levels and pMCC cue activation).

In mouse hippocampal neurons lacking Syt1/Doc2, Syt7 inactivation largely diminishes spontaneous release. Using 2 approaches, including measuring Ca2+ dose response and substituting extracellular Ca2+ with Sr2+, we detect that Syt7 directly triggers spontaneous release via its Ca2+ binding motif to activate GluN2B-NMDARs. Furthermore, modifying the localization of Syt7 in the active zone still allows Syt7 to drive spontaneous release, but the GluN2B-NMDAR activity is abolished. Finally, Syt7 SNPs identified in bipolar disorder patients destroy the function of Syt7 in spontaneous release in patient iPSC-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons. Therefore, Syt7 could contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders through driving spontaneous glutamate release.",

In particular, rapid reductions in depressive symptoms have been observed in response to subanesthetic doses of the glutamatergic modulator racemic (R,S)-ketamine in individuals with mood disorders. These results have prompted investigation into other glutamatergic modulators for depression, both as monotherapy and adjunctively. Several glutamate receptor-modulating agents have been tested in proof-of-concept studies for mood disorders. This manuscript gives a brief overview of the glutamate system and its relevance to rapid antidepressant response and discusses the existing clinical evidence for glutamate receptor-modulating agents, including (1) broad glutamatergic modulators ((R,S)-ketamine, esketamine, (R)-ketamine, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine [HNK], dextromethorphan, Nuedexta [a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine], deudextromethorphan [AVP-786], axsome [AXS-05], dextromethadone [REL-1017], nitrous oxide, AZD6765, CLE100, AGN-241751); (2) glycine site modulators (D-cycloserine [DCS], NRX-101, rapastinel [GLYX-13], apimostinel [NRX-1074], sarcosine, 4-chlorokynurenine [4-Cl-KYN/AV-101]); (3) subunit (NR2B)-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (eliprodil [EVT-101], traxoprodil [CP-101,606], rislenemdaz [MK-0657/CERC-301]); (4) metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) modulators (basimglurant, AZD2066, RG1578, TS-161); and (5) mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activators (NV-5138). Many of these agents are still in the preliminary stages of development. Furthermore, to date, most have demonstrated relatively modest effects compared with (R,S)-ketamine and esketamine, though some have shown more favorable characteristics. Of these novel agents, the most promising, and the ones for which the most evidence exists, appear to be those targeting ionotropic glutamate receptors.",

        "abstract": "The amino acids that function as co-agonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor have been investigated in bipolar disorder (BD). However, studies comparing amino acid levels in the plasma of BD patients with healthy controls have yielded inconsistent results. We, therefore, conducted a study in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia to determine the plasma levels of glutamate, glycine, and alanine in BD patients and compared them with the healthy controls. An overnight fast of 10-hour plasma levels of glutamate, glycine, alanine, and tryptophan were measured in 83 bipolar patients, and were compared to a group of 82 healthy controls. The mean (SD) age of bipolar patients was 40.9 (12.1), while the mean (SD) age for control groups was 35.6 (7.7) years. The median (25th, 75th percentile) of glutamate and alanine levels in bipolar patients was 111.0 (65.0,176.0) and 530.0 (446.0,629.0), respectively, while the mean (SD) of glycine level in bipolar patients was 304.0 (98.1). Significant higher glutamate, glycine, and alanine levels were found in bipolar disorder patients in the manic episode as compared to the healthy controls. Although the exact relationship between peripheral NMDA receptor co-agonist levels in the pathogenesis of BD is not well understood, these findings should be explored and may enlighten some new paths for BD therapy which could reward the patients also clinicians.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the mechanism of action of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in depressive symptoms in young individuals at familial risk for bipolar disorder. We conducted an 8-week open label clinical trial of NAC 2400\u2009mg/days in 15-24\u2009years old depressed offspring of a bipolar I disorder parent, with baseline and endpoint proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy acquired within the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Nine participants were enrolled and finished the study. NAC significantly improved depressive and anxiety symptom scores, and clinical global impression (all p\u00a0<\u2009.001). There was a non-significant reduction in glutamate levels in the left VLPFC. Reduction in depressive symptom scores was positively associated with reduction in glutamate levels in the left VLPFC (p\u00a0=\u2009.007). This pilot study suggests that NAC might be efficacious for depressive symptoms in at-risk youth, and that its mechanism of action involves the modulation of glutamate in the left VLPFC.",

        "abstract": "The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region that mediates affect and cognition by connecting the frontal cortex to limbic structures, has been consistently implicated in the neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder (BD). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) studies have extensively compared in vivo neurometabolite levels of BD patients and healthy controls (HC) in the ACC. However, these studies have not been analyzed in a systematic review or meta-analysis and nor has the influence of mood state and medication on neurometabolites been examined in this cortical region. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies comparing ACC neurometabolite profiles of adult BD patients and HC subjects was conducted, retrieving 27 articles published between 2000 and 2018. Overall increased ACC levels of Glx [glutamine (Gln)\u202f+\u202fglutamate)/Creatine], Gln, choline (Cho) and Cho/Creatine were found in BD compared to HC. Bipolar depression was associated with higher Cho levels, while euthymia correlated with higher glutamine (Gln) and Cho. Mood stabilizers appeared to affect ACC Glu and Gln metabolites. Increased ACC Cho observed in euthymia, depression and in medication-free groups could be considered a trait marker in BD and attributed to increased cell membrane phospholipid turnover. Overall increased ACC Glx was associated with elevated Gln levels, particularly influenced by euthymia, but no abnormality in Glu was detected. Further <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies, on other voxels, should assess more homogeneous (mood state-specific), larger BD samples and account for medication status using more sensitive <sup>1</sup>H-MRS techniques.",

        "abstract": "The understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) remains modest, despite recent advances in neurobiological research. The mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis of bipolar disorder has been corroborated by several studies involving postmortem brain analysis, neuroimaging, and specific biomarkers in both rodent models and humans. Evidence suggests that BD might be related to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, neuroimmune dysfunction, and atypical mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction in mood disorders is also associated with abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, glutamate excitotoxicity, an imbalance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins towards apoptosis, abnormal gene expression of electron transport chain complexes, and decreased ATP synthesis. This paper aims to review and discuss the implications of mitochondrial dysfunction in BD etiology and to explore mitochondria as a potential target for novel therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "To explore the relationship between inflammation and neuronal metabolism in bipolar disorder (BD) by evaluating the neurochemical effects of the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) antagonist infliximab among individuals with bipolar depression METHODS: This is a post-hoc, exploratory analysis from a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with infliximab for adults with bipolar depression. We assessed the effects of infliximab on concentration of metabolites in the prefrontal cortex, using proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS), as well as its association with clinical outcomes (i.e. depressive symptom severity and cognitive function). Eighteen participants in the placebo and 15 in the infliximab group were included in this analysis. In the pre-specified primary outcome, there were no significant effects of treatment on prefrontal concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA; p\u00a0=\u00a00.712). In the secondary analyses, there was a significant treatment by time interaction for glutamate (Glx; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), indicating that Glx levels decreased in infliximab-treated patients, relative to placebo. Treatment group significantly moderated the association between changes in Glx levels and changes in a neurocognitive test (i.e. Digit Symbol Substitution Test; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), indicating that in infliximab-treated participants reductions in Glx were associated with cognitive improvement. Treatment with infliximab did not affect prefrontal NAA concentration in adults with BD. Exploratory analysis suggested a potential effect of treatment on the glutamate system, a finding that should be confirmed and validated by additional studies.",

        "abstract": "Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) probably plays an important role in bipolar-like behavioral abnormalities in mice; however, the underlying mechanisms for this have remained elusive. Unlike antidepressants that cause mood overcorrection in bipolar depression, <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-targeted drugs show moderate clinical efficacy, for unexplained reasons. Here we identified Syt7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with bipolar disorder and demonstrated that mice lacking Syt7 or expressing the SNPs showed GluN2B-NMDAR dysfunction, leading to antidepressant behavioral consequences and avoidance of overcorrection by NMDAR antagonists. In human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons, Syt7 and GluN2B-NMDARs were localized to the peripheral synaptic region, and Syt7 triggered multiple forms of glutamate release to efficiently activate the juxtaposed GluN2B-NMDARs. Thus, while Syt7 deficiency and SNPs induced GluN2B-NMDAR dysfunction in mice, patient iPSC-derived neurons showed Syt7 deficit-induced GluN2B-NMDAR hypoactivity that was rescued by Syt7 overexpression. Therefore, Syt7 deficits induced mania-like behaviors in mice by attenuating GluN2B activity, which enabled NMDAR antagonists to avoid mood overcorrection.",

        "title": "Glutamatergic Correlates of Bipolar Symptoms in Adolescents.",
        "abstract": "<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> Prior studies demonstrate elevated cortical glutamate (Glu) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Studies assessing neurochemistry in early stages of bipolar illness before the emergence of manic symptoms are lacking. This study aimed to examine neurochemical correlates measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and a dimensional measure of bipolarity in a sample of depressed adolescents. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Adolescent participants (aged 13-21 years) underwent a semistructured diagnostic interview and clinical assessment, which included the General Behavior Inventory Parent Version (P-GBI), a 73-item, parent-rated assessment of symptoms and behaviors. <sup>1</sup>H-MRS scans of a left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) voxel (8\u2009cm<sup>3</sup>) were collected using a two-dimensional <i>J</i>-averaged sequence to assess <i>N</i>-acetylaspartate (NAA), Glu, Glx (glutamate + glutamine), and NAA/Glx concentrations. We used generalized linear models to assess the relationships between P-GBI scores and metabolite levels in L-DLPFC. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Thirty-six participants (17 healthy controls, 19 depressed) underwent <sup>1</sup>H-MRS scans and clinical evaluation with the P-GBI. There was a significant negative relationship between P-GBI score and L-DLPFC NAA/Glx in the whole sample. However, the magnitude of the effect was small and statistical significance was lost after correcting for multiple comparisons. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> These preliminary results suggest that NAA/Glx may have utility as a marker of bipolar traits in healthy and depressed adolescents. If replicated, <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measures of glutamatergic metabolism anomalies might have a role in identifying depressed adolescents at risk for mixed symptom presentations or BD. Identifying bipolarity in the early stages of the disease would have a significant impact on treatment planning and prognosis. Further longitudinal studies should examine neurochemical correlates of mood state during the developmental emergence of BD.",
