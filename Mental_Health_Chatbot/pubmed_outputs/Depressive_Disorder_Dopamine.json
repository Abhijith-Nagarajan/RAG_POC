        "title": "A novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor induces antidepressant, pro-cognitive, and anti-anhedonic effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats: The role of the ghrelin-dopamine cascade.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often treatment resistant, particularly in addressing anhedonia and cognitive deficits. Novel pharmacological strategies are needed. While butyrylcholinesterase, ghrelin, and dopamine (DA) have been well studied in the context of stress and MDD, their interaction remains unclear. The dose-dependent antidepressant effects of a novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor (BChEI) were evaluated in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model of MDD. Behavioural assessments included the forced swim test (despair), sucrose preference test (reward-related), and novel object recognition test (cognition). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), acetylcholine (ACh), and brain monoamines were analysed, as well as serum growth hormone and acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin. To confirm the role of ghrelin, pharmacological exploration was undertaken using the ghrelin receptor antagonist, D-Lys-3-GHRP-6. FSL rats had significantly lower ghrelin ratios, BDNF, ACh, DA and growth hormone levels. In FSL rats, both BChEI and escitalopram significantly reduced despair. BChEI significantly outperformed escitalopram in enhancing reward-related and cognitive behaviours. Biochemically, BChEI treatment significantly increased ghrelin ratios and brain DA levels without altering brain 5-HT, ACh or BDNF. D-Lys-3-GHRP-6 significantly reversed the antidepressant-like, rewarding, and pro-cognitive effects of BChEI, accompanied by significant reductions in BDNF and DA. FSL rats display impaired ghrelin, DA, serotonin, growth hormone, and BDNF signalling, akin to MDD. BChEI exerts antidepressant-like effects across despair, reward, and cognitive domains, most likely via the BChE-ghrelin-DA cascade. Reversal of these effects by ghrelin antagonism underscores the critical role of ghrelin, specifically via growth hormone secretagogue receptor-ghrelin interaction. These findings suggest a potentially novel multimodal neurobiological target for the treatment of MDD.",

        "title": "Neural energy coding patterns of dopaminergic neural microcircuit and its impairment in major depressive disorder: A computational study.",
        "abstract": "Numerous experiments have found that the behavioral characteristics of major depressive disorder (MDD) animals are usually associated with abnormal neural activity patterns and brain energy metabolism. However, the relationship among the behavioral characteristics, neural activity patterns and brain energy metabolism remains unknown. In this paper, we computationally investigated this relationship, with a particular focus on how neural energy coding patterns change in MDD brains, in the VTA-NAc-mPFC dopaminergic pathway of the reward system based on our biological neural network model and neural energy calculation model. Interestingly, our results suggested that the neural energy consumption of the whole VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit in MDD group was significantly reduced, which was mainly attributed to the decreasing neural energy consumption in the mPFC region. This observation theoretically supported the view of low-level energy consumption in MDD. We also investigated the neural energy consumption patterns of various neuronal types in our VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit under the influence of different dopamine concentrations, and found that there were some specific impairments in MDD, which provided some potential biomarkers for MDD diagnosis. More specifically, we found that the actual neural energy consumption of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc region was increased in the MDD group, whereas pyramidal neurons in the mPFC region exhibited higher actual neural energy consumption in the NC group. Additionally, in both neuron types, the actual neural energy required to generate an action potential was higher in the MDD group, suggesting that, given the same energy budget, these neurons in the MDD group tended to generate fewer action potentials. To further explore the relationship between neural coding patterns and neural energy coding patterns in the VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit, we in addition calculated P-V correlation for each neuronal type, defined as the Pearson's correlation coefficient between membrane potential and neural power. The results showed that the membrane potential and neural power were not perfectly correlated (P-V correlations ranged from 0.6 to 0.9), and dopamine concentration inputs affected the P-V correlations of the MSN, pyramidal neurons and CB interneurons in the mPFC region. These findings suggested that the joint application of the neural coding theory and neural energy coding theory will be superior to the application of any single theory, and this joint application could help discover new mechanisms in neurocircuits of MDD. Overall, our study not only uncovered the neural energy coding patterns for the VTA-NAc-mPFC neural microcircuit, but also presented a novel pipeline for the study of MDD based on the neural coding theory and neural energy coding theory.",

        "abstract": "In addition to the core clinical features of fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism, individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) frequently experience chronic and debilitating major depression. Treatment of depression in DLB is hampered by a lack of available effective therapies and standard serotonergic medication for major depressive disorder (MDD) is typically ineffective. Dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission contributing to anhedonia and loss of motivation has been described in MDD. The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) is important in mood regulation and in the symptomatic expression of depression, displaying structural, functional and metabolic abnormalities in MDD. To assess dopaminergic and serotonergic synaptic changes in DLB, post mortem sgACC tissue from DLB donors with and without depression was investigated using high-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, as well as Western and dot blotting techniques. STED imaging demonstrated the presence of \u03b1-synuclein within individual dopaminergic terminals in the sgACC, \u03b1-synuclein presence showing a significant positive correlation with increased synaptosomal associated protein 25\u2009kDa (SNAP25) volumes in depressed DLB cases. A reduction in dopaminergic innervation in the sgACC was observed in DLB cases with depression compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not in non-depressed DLB donors, along with reduced levels of multiple dopaminergic markers and receptors. Limited alterations were observed in serotonergic markers. Our work demonstrates a role for dopaminergic neurotransmission in the aetiology of depression in DLB. Careful and selective targeting of dopaminergic systems in the sgACC may be a therapeutic option for treatment of depression in DLB.",

        "title": "Gestational stress disrupts dopamine and oxytocin signaling in the postpartum reward system of rats: implications for mood, motivation and mothering.",
        "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to 20% of new mothers and has adverse consequences for the well-being of both mother and child. Exposure to stress during pregnancy as well as dysregulation in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) reward system and its upstream modulator oxytocin (OT) have been independently linked to PPD. However, no studies have directly examined DA or OT signaling in the postpartum brain after gestational stress. Here we employed a chronic variable stress procedure during pregnancy and evaluated behavioral measures of mood and reward along with assessments of DA and OT signaling in postpartum rats. Our results show that gestational stress induced postpartum depressive-like and anxiety-like behavior in addition to producing reward-related deficits including anhedonia, impaired maternal care, and reduced maternal motivation. Consistent with a hypodopaminergic state, histological analysis revealed reduced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the NAc shell and core as well as reduced expression of the dopamine transporter and dopamine D2 receptor in the NAc shell of postpartum females exposed to gestational stress. A reduction in accumbal DA content as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was also observed in gestationally-stressed dams. Lastly, we assessed mRNA expression of OT and OT receptors (OTR) and found that gestational stress increased OT expression in the hypothalamus but reduced OTR expression in the postpartum ventral tegmental area (VTA), a target of hypothalamic OT neurons. In the VTA, a reduction in OT-immunoreactive fibers following gestational stress was also seen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the DA and OT systems within the postpartum reward circuit are sensitive to gestational stress and suggest that mood and maternal disruptions in PPD may arise from dysfunctional oxytocinergic regulation of the dopaminergic reward system.",

However, the use of conventional MRI scanners and acquisition techniques has prevented a thorough examination of DA neural pathways in MDD. We uniquely employed ultra-high field diffusion MRI at 7.0 Tesla to map the white matter architecture and integrity of several DA pathways in MDD patients. Fifty-three MDD patients and 12 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the final analysis. Images were acquired using a 7.0 Tesla MRI scanner. FreeSurfer was used to segment components of DA pathways, and MRtrix was used to perform preprocessing and tractography of mesolimbic, mesocortical, nigrostriatal, and unconventional DA pathways. Bayesian analyses assessed the impact of MDD and clinical features on DA tracts. MDD was associated with perturbed white matter microstructural properties of the nigrostriatal pathway, while several MDD features (severity of depression/age of onset/insomnia) related to connectivity changes within mesocortical, nigrostriatal, and unconventional pathways. MDD is associated with microstructural differences in the nigrostriatal pathway. The findings provide insight into the structural architecture and integrity of several DA pathways in MDD, and implicate their involvement in the clinical manifestation of MDD.",

        "title": "Novel multi-modal methodology to investigate placebo response in major depressive disorder.",
        "abstract": "The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the placebo phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain largely unknown. The progressive rise in rates of placebo responses within clinical trials over the past two decades may impede the detection of a true signal and thus present a major obstacle in new treatment development. Understanding the mechanisms would have several important implications, including (1) identifying biomarkers of placebo responders (thereby identifying those individuals who could benefit therapeutically from such interventions), (2) opening new avenues for manipulating such mechanisms to maximize symptom reduction, and (3) refining treatments with approaches that decrease (in clinical trials) or increase (in clinical practice) the placebo response. Here we investigated the research question: is the dopaminergic system one of the neurobiological underpinnings of the placebo response within MDD? Inspired by preclinical and clinical findings that have implicated dopamine in the occurrence, prediction, and expectation of reward, we hypothesized that dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic system is a critical mediator of placebo response in MDD. To test this hypothesis, we designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design clinical trial aimed at maximizing placebo antidepressant response. We integrated behavioral, imaging, and hemodynamic probes of mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways within the context of manipulations of psychological constructs previously linked to placebo responses (e.g., expectation of improvement). The aim of this manuscript is to present the rationale of the study design and to demonstrate how a cross-modal methodology may be utilized to investigate the role of reward circuitry in placebo response in MDD.",

        "title": "Effect of esketamine on serum neurotransmitters in patients with postpartum depression: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "The development of postpartum depression has been linked to fluctuations in the levels of neurotransmitters in the human body, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (Norepinephrine, NE), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research has indicated that the antidepressant effect of esketamine are mediated by monoamine transmitters and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we postulate that intravenous administration of esketamine in patients with postpartum depression may alter the serum concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Three hundred fifteen patients with postpartum depression were selected and divided into two groups based on randomized numerical expression: esketamine (E) group (0. 25\u00a0mg/kg esketamine) and control (C) group (a same volume of 0.9% saline), all the drugs were pumped for 40\u00a0min. After the end of drug pumping, all patients were continuously observed for 2\u00a0h. Changes in serum levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, BDNF were recorded before drug administration and on the 3rd day after drug administration. The scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were calculated before drug administration, and on the 3rd day and on the 30th day after drug administration. Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and feeling of detachment occurred were recorded within 2\u00a0h after drug administration. Before drug administration, the serum concentrations of 5-HT,DA,BDNF,NE in Group E and Group C were namely (0. 91\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 19 vs. 0. 98\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 21, P\u2009=\u20090. 181), (2. 38\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 35 vs. 2. 32\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 32, P\u2009=\u20090. 491), (3. 07\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 89 vs 3. 02\u2009\u00b1\u20090. 88, P\u2009=\u20090. 828), (39. 79\u2009\u00b1\u20097. 78 vs 41. 34\u2009\u00b1\u200910. 03, P\u2009=\u20090. 506).

        "abstract": "Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, exerting a profound negative impact on quality of life in those who experience it. Depression is associated with disruptions to several closely related neural and cognitive processes, including dopamine transmission, fronto-striatal brain activity and connectivity, reward processing and motivation. Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, reduces depressive symptoms, but the mechanisms driving its antidepressant effects are poorly understood. Here we propose a novel hypothesis for understanding the antidepressant effects of exercise, centred on motivation, across different levels of explanation. There is robust evidence that aerobic exercise decreases systemic inflammation. Inflammation is known to reduce dopamine transmission, which in turn is strongly implicated in effort-based decision making for reward. Drawing on a broad range of research in humans and animals, we propose that by reducing inflammation and boosting dopamine transmission, with consequent effects on effort-based decision making for reward, exercise initially specifically improves 'interest-activity' symptoms of depression-namely anhedonia, fatigue and subjective cognitive impairment - by increasing propensity to exert effort. Extending this framework to the topic of cognitive control, we explain how cognitive impairment in depression may also be conceptualised through an effort-based decision-making framework, which may help to explain the impact of exercise on cognitive impairment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of exercise could inform the development of novel intervention strategies, in particular personalised interventions and boost social prescribing.",

We examined the relationship between dopaminergic deficit in the striatum, as measured by <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging, and specific psychopathological dimensions in patients with major depressive disorder. To our knowledge this is the first study with a sample of >120 subjects. After check for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 121 (67 females, 54 males) patients were chosen retrospectively from an extensive 1106 patients database of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT scans obtained at the Nuclear Medicine Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. These individuals had undergone striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) assessments based on the recommendation of their referring clinicians, who were either neurologists or psychiatrists. At the time of SPECT imaging, each participant underwent psychiatric and psychometric evaluations. We used the following psychometric scales: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and Depression Retardation Rating Scale. We found a negative correlation between levels of depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), anxiety (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), anhedonia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and psychomotor retardation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and DAT availability in the left putamen.

To our knowledge this is the first study to have such a high number of sample. Our study reveals a pivotal role of dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with major depressive disorder.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that binds to G-protein-coupled receptors.

The dysfunction of the dopamine system leads to several conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, major depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been identified as an important relay nucleus that modulates homeostatic plasticity in the midbrain dopamine system. Due to the complexity of synaptic transmissions and input-output connections in the VTA, the structure and function of this crucial brain region are still not fully understood. In this review article, we mainly focus on the cell types, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, ion channels, receptors, and neural circuits of the VTA dopamine system, with the hope of obtaining new insight into the formation and function of this vital brain region.",

        "abstract": "Identifying additional noninvasive biomarkers for affective disorders, such as unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), could aid in the diagnosis and treatment of these prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric conditions. One such candidate biomarker is the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), an event-related potential that measures responsiveness of the auditory cortex to different intensities of sound. The LDAEP has been associated with MDD and BD, including therapeutic response to particular classes of antidepressant drugs, while also correlating with several other neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been suggested that increased values of the LDAEP indicate low central serotonergic neurotransmission, further implicating this EEG measure in depression. Here, we briefly review the literature on the LDAEP in affective disorders, including its association with serotonergic signaling, as well as with that of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine. We summarize key findings on the LDAEP and the genetics of these neurotransmitters, as well as prediction of response to particular classes of antidepressants in MDD, including SSRIs versus noradrenergic agents. The possible relationship between this EEG measure and suicidality is addressed. We also briefly analyze acute pharmacologic studies of serotonin and/or dopamine precursor depletion and the LDAEP. In conclusion, the existing literature suggests that serotonin and norepinephrine may modulate the LDAEP in an opposing manner, and that this event-related marker may be of use in predicting response to chronic treatment with particular pharmacologic agents in the context of affective disorders, such as MDD and BD, including in the presence of suicidality.",

If multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy fail in some patients with MDD, their condition is then termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MDD can be associated with abnormalities in the reward-system-dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, in which the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) play major roles. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the NAc alleviates the depressive symptoms of MDD. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of this DBS has remained elusive. In this study, using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we investigated the behavioral and neurobiological effects of NAc-DBS on the multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by CUMS by integrating behavioral, in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), calcium imaging, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation methods in freely moving mice. We found that long-term and repeated, but not single, NAc-DBS induced robust antidepressant responses in CUMS mice. Moreover, even a single trial NAc-DBS led to the elevation of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, accompanied by the increase in dopamine (DA) neuron activity in the VTA. Both the inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity and knockdown of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-\u03b11 gene in VTA-GABA neurons blocked the antidepressant effect of NAc-DBS in CUMS mice. Our results showed that NAc-DBS could disinhibit VTA-DA neurons by regulating the level of GABA and the activity of VTA-GABA in the VTA and could finally correct the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mouse model.",

        "title": "Ventral tegmental area dopaminergic circuits participates in stress-induced chronic postsurgical pain in male mice.",
        "abstract": "Chronic postsurgical pain (CPP) markedly impairs patients' quality of life. Research has shown that chronic stress may extend incisional nociception in male mice. Dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are integral to stress-related mental disorders (including major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and PTSD) and pain. However, the impact of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission in the development of CPP is yet to be established. It remains uncertain whether the dopamine signals in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), which regulate pain, derive from the VTA. This study aims to explore the role of VTA-rACC dopaminergic circuits in a mouse model of CPP induced by CSDS. We conducted CSDS on C57BL/6\u00a0J wild-type male mice (n\u2009=\u200912-16 mice/group) and DAT-cre male mice (n\u2009=\u200910-12 mice/group). After 10\u00a0days of CSDS, a left posterior plantar incision was made to establish a mouse model of CPP. Paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) were evaluated using Von-Frey fibre stimulation. The open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPM) were used to assess pain-related negative emotions. We used immunofluorescence staining and Western Blot to analyse D1, D2, c-Fos, and TH expression. DAergic fibre projections in the VTA-rACC neural pathway were traced using retrograde tracing and immunofluorescence staining. Optogenetics and Chemogenetics were employed to manipulate DAergic neurons in the VTA and their axons in the rACC. The ipsilateral PWTs in male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice significantly decreased after surgery, returning to baseline after seven days. Conversely, in CSDS mice, ipsilateral PWTs remained reduced for at least 30\u00a0days post-incision. A significant reduction in TH-positive neurons expressing c-Fos in the VTA of CPP mice was observed 15\u00a0days post-incision. Activating DAergic neurons significantly improved ipsilateral PWTs and locomotor performance in the OFT and EPM in CPP mice post-incision. Additionally, D1 expression in the rACC was found to decrease in CPP mice, and this reduction counteracted the increase in PWTs caused by activating DAergic neuron axon terminals in the rACC. CSDS results in chronicity of postsurgical nociception and anxiety-like negative emotions, with alterations in DA transmission playing a role in CPP. Specific activation of DAergic neurons mitigates nociceptive responses and anxiety-like bahaviors, possibly mediated by D1 receptors in the rACC.",

        "title": "Dopamine in major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo imaging studies.",
        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability. Several lines of evidence implicate the dopamine system in its pathophysiology. However, the magnitude and consistency of the findings are unknown. We address this by systematically reviewing in vivo imaging evidence for dopamine measures in MDD and meta-analysing these where there are sufficient studies. Studies investigating the dopaminergic system using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography in MDD and a control group were included. Demographic, clinical and imaging measures were extracted from each study, and meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. We identified 43 studies including 662 patients and 801 controls. Meta-analysis of 38 studies showed no difference in mean or mean variability of striatal D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability (<i>g</i>\u2009=\u20090.06, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.620), or combined dopamine synthesis and release capacity (<i>g</i>\u2009=\u20090.19, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.309). Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was lower in the MDD group in studies using DAT selective tracers (<i>g</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.56, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.006), but not when tracers with an affinity for serotonin transporters were included (<i>g</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.21, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.420). Subgroup analysis showed greater dopamine release (<i>g</i>\u2009=\u20090.49, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.030), but no difference in dopamine synthesis capacity (<i>g</i>\u2009=\u2009-0.21, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.434) in the MDD group. Striatal D<sub>1</sub> receptor availability was lower in patients with MDD in two studies. The meta-analysis indicates striatal DAT availability is lower, but D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability is not altered in people with MDD compared to healthy controls. There may be greater dopamine release and lower striatal D<sub>1</sub> receptors in MDD, although further studies are warranted. We discuss factors associated with these findings, discrepancies with preclinical literature and implications for future research.",

        "title": "Neural energy computations based on Hodgkin-Huxley models bridge abnormal neuronal activities and energy consumption patterns of major depressive disorder.",
        "abstract": "Limited by the current experimental techniques and neurodynamical models, the dysregulation mechanisms of decision-making related neural circuits in major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not clear. In this paper, we proposed a neural coding methodology using energy to further investigate it, which has been proven to strongly complement the neurodynamical methodology. We augmented the previous neural energy calculation method, and applied it to our VTA-NAc-mPFC neurodynamical H-H models. We particularly focused on the peak power and energy consumption of abnormal ion channel (ionic) currents under different concentrations of dopamine input, and investigated the abnormal energy consumption patterns for the MDD group. The results revealed that the energy consumption of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc region were lower in the MDD group than that of the normal control group despite having the same firing frequencies, peak action potentials, and average membrane potentials in both groups. Dopamine concentration was also positively correlated with the energy consumption of the pyramidal neurons, but the patterns of different interneuron types were distinct. Additionally, the ratio of mPFC's energy consumption to total energy consumption of the whole network in MDD group was lower than that in normal control group, revealing that the mPFC region in MDD group encoded less neural information, which matched the energy consumption patterns of BOLD-fMRI results. It was also in line with the behavioral characteristics that MDD patients demonstrated in the form of reward insensitivity during decision-making tasks. In conclusion, the model in this paper was the first neural network energy computational model for MDD, which showed success in explaining its dynamical mechanisms with an energy consumption perspective. To build on this, we demonstrated that energy consumption levels can be used as a potential indicator for MDD, which also showed a promising pipeline to use an energy methodology for studying other neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "title": "D1R-5-HT2AR Uncoupling Reduces Depressive Behaviours via HDAC Signalling.",
        "abstract": "Dopamine and serotonin signalling are associated with major depressive disorder, which is a prevalent life-threatening illness worldwide. Numerous FDA-approved dopamine/serotonin signalling-modifying drugs are available but are associated with concurrent side effects and limited efficacy. Thus, identifying and targeting their signalling pathway is crucial for improving depression treatment. Here, we determined that serotonin receptor 2A (5-HT2AR) abundantly forms a protein complex with dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) in high abundance via its carboxy-terminus in the brains of mice subjected to various chronic stress paradigms. Furthermore, the D1R/5-HT2AR interaction elicited CREB/ERK/AKT modulation during synaptic regulation. An interfering peptide (TAT-5-HT2AR-SV) agitated the D1R/5-HT2AR interaction and attenuated depressive symptoms accompanied by CREB/ERK molecule costimulation. Interestingly, HDAC antagonism but not TrkB antagonism reversed the antidepressant effect of competitive peptides. These findings revealed a novel D1R/5-HT2AR heteroreceptor complex mechanism in the pathophysiology of depression, and their uncoupling ameliorates depressive-like behaviours through HDAC-, and not BDNF-, dependent mechanisms.",

        "title": "Evaluating lumateperone for its use in treating depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder in adults.",
        "abstract": "Lumateperone is a novel antipsychotic medication that has recently received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of major depressive episodes of type I and II bipolar disorder. It is approved for use as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproic acid. Clinical trials performed with lumateperone for bipolar disorder were reviewed. Additionally, pharmacodynamic actions of lumateperone are reviewed. Lumateperone is superior to placebo whether used alone or in combination with a mood stabilizer in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder. It achieves this effect with minimal dopamine blockade-related side effects due to less than 50% dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. While the pharmacodynamic profile of lumateperone is unique, the mechanism of action in bipolar depression remains obscure. Lumateperone is an antipsychotic with full antagonist effects at the post-synaptic D2, and partial agonist effects at the presynaptic D2. This unique profile allows for both antipsychotic and antidepressant effects at the same dose, which does not produce dopamine-related side effects. Consequently, lumateperone is exceptionally well tolerated compared to other antidepressant-acting antipsychotic agents. It is now the only agent approved as an adjunct to the mood stabilizer for bipolar II depression.",

        "abstract": "Anhedonia is hypothesized to be associated with blunted mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) functioning in samples with major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine linkages between striatal DA, reward circuitry functioning, anhedonia, and, in an exploratory fashion, self-reported stress, in a transdiagnostic anhedonic sample. Participants with (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and without (n\u00a0=\u00a012) clinically impairing anhedonia completed a reward-processing task during simultaneous positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance (PET-MR) imaging with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, a DA D2/D3 receptor antagonist that selectively binds to striatal DA receptors. Relative to controls, the anhedonia group exhibited decreased task-related DA release in the left putamen, caudate, and nucleus accumbens and right putamen and pallidum. There were no group differences in task-related brain activation (fMRI) during reward processing after correcting for multiple comparisons. General functional connectivity (GFC) findings revealed blunted fMRI connectivity between PET-derived striatal seeds and target regions in the anhedonia group. Associations were identified between anhedonia severity and the magnitude of task-related DA release to rewards in the left putamen, but not mesocorticolimbic GFC. Results provide evidence for reduced striatal DA functioning during reward processing and blunted mesocorticolimbic network functional connectivity in a transdiagnostic sample with clinically significant anhedonia.",

Over fifty years of investigation of mood disorders using these technologies has identified several biological regularities in these disorders. Here we present a narrative connecting genetic, cytokine, neurotransmitter, and neural-systems-level findings in major depressive disorder (MDD). Specifically, we connect recent genome-wide findings in MDD to metabolic and immunological disturbance in this disorder and then detail links between immunological abnormalities and dopaminergic signaling within cortico-striatal circuitry. Following this, we discuss implications of reduced dopaminergic tone for cortico-striatal signal conduction in MDD. Finally, we specify some of the flaws in the current model and propose ways forward for advancing multilevel formulations of MDD most efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and major depressive disorder (MDD) are the leading causes of disability worldwide and have a high comorbidity rate with fatal outcomes. Despite the long-established association between these conditions, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Since the discovery of insulin receptors in the brain and the brain's reward system, evidence has accumulated indicating that insulin modulates dopaminergic (DA) signalling and reward behaviour. Here, we review the evidence from rodent and human studies, that insulin resistance directly alters central DA pathways, which may result in motivational deficits and depressive symptoms. Specifically, we first elaborate on the differential effects of insulin on DA signalling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) - the primary DA source region in the midbrain - and the striatum as well as its effects on behaviour. We then focus on the alterations induced by insulin deficiency and resistance. Finally, we review the impact of insulin resistance in DA pathways in promoting depressive symptoms and anhedonia on a molecular and epidemiological level and discuss its relevance for stratified treatment strategies.",

        "title": "Distinctive alterations in the mesocorticolimbic circuits in various psychiatric disorders.",
        "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that psychiatric disorders are linked to alterations in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related circuits. However, the common and disease-specific alterations remain to be examined in schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thus, this study aimed to examine common and disease-specific features related to mesocorticolimbic circuits. This study included 555 participants from four institutes with five scanners: 140 individuals with SCZ (45.0% female), 127 individuals with MDD (44.9%), 119 individuals with ASD (15.1%), and 169 healthy controls (HC) (34.9%). All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A parametric empirical Bayes approach was adopted to compare estimated effective connectivity among groups. Intrinsic effective connectivity focusing on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related circuits including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), shell and core parts of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were examined using a dynamic causal modeling analysis across these psychiatric disorders. The excitatory shell-to-core connectivity was greater in all patients than in the HC group. The inhibitory shell-to-VTA and shell-to-mPFC connectivities were greater in the ASD group than in the HC, MDD, and SCZ groups. Furthermore, the VTA-to-core and VTA-to-shell connectivities were excitatory in the ASD group, while those connections were inhibitory in the HC, MDD, and SCZ groups. Impaired signaling in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine-related circuits could be an underlying neuropathogenesis of various psychiatric disorders. These findings will improve the understanding of unique neural alternations of each disorder and will facilitate identification of effective therapeutic targets.",
