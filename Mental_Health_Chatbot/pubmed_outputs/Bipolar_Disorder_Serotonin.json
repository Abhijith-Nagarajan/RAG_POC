        "title": "Dynamic Model of Serotonin Presynapse and Its Application to Suicide Attempt in Patients with Bipolar Disorder.",
        "abstract": "Suicide attempts are prevalent among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Impaired serotonin (5-HT) system in the pathogenesis of suicide attempt is partially heritable. To quantify the combined effects of multiple genetic variants, we developed a dynamic model of the 5-HT presynapse with functionally integrated individual genetic variants. The model includes five genetic variants in 5-HT system genes (<i>TPH2</i>, <i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>MAOA</i>) and quantitatively assesses their influence on 5-HT synthesis, reuptake, and degradation. The model was validated on 140 unaffected individuals and tested on 101 BD patients. Predicted mean concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HT precursor, and degradation product were compared between BD patients with and without a history of attempted suicide, and unaffected individuals. The model consists of eight differential equations that describe the temporal concentration change of model outputs. Calculated concentrations in unaffected control individuals aligned with published experimentally measured values, validating our model. BD patients with a history of suicide attempt showed lower calculated concentrations of 5-HT degradation product 5-hydroxy-3-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) compared to unaffected individuals (<i>p</i> = 0.044). Additionally, higher calculated concentrations of free cellular 5-HT (<i>p</i> = 0.048) and stored 5-HT (<i>p</i> = 0.047), with the effect size d = 0.35, were observed when comparing suicide attempters to non-attempters.. Our approach illuminated a complex interplay of genetic variants in 5-HT system genes that contributes to the risk of suicide attempt, with quantitative and personalized outputs unattainable through genetic association studies.",

        "title": "Impact of Serotonin Deficiency on Circadian Dopaminergic Rhythms.",
        "abstract": "Physiology and behavior are structured temporally to anticipate daily cycles of light and dark, ensuring fitness and survival. Neuromodulatory systems in the brain-including those involving serotonin and dopamine-exhibit daily oscillations in neural activity and help shape circadian rhythms. Disrupted neuromodulation can cause circadian abnormalities that are thought to underlie several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar mania and schizophrenia, for which a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we show that genetically depleting serotonin in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice promotes manic-like behaviors and disrupts daily oscillations of the dopamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in midbrain dopaminergic nuclei. Specifically, while TH mRNA and protein levels in the Substantia Nigra (SN) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of wild-type mice doubled between the light and dark phase, TH levels were high throughout the day in <i>Tph2</i> knockout mice, suggesting a hyperdopaminergic state. Analysis of TH expression in striatal terminal fields also showed blunted rhythms. Additionally, we found low abundance and blunted rhythmicity of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (Cck) in the VTA of knockout mice, a neuropeptide whose downregulation has been implicated in manic-like states in both rodents and humans. Altogether, our results point to a previously unappreciated serotonergic control of circadian dopamine signaling and propose serotonergic dysfunction as an upstream mechanism underlying dopaminergic deregulation and ultimately maladaptive behaviors.",

This sequential-cohort, dose-escalation study was the first to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profile of cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, desmethyl-cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethyl-cariprazine (DDCAR), in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This phase I open-label study enrolled patients with schizophrenia (13-17 years of age) or bipolar I disorder (10-17 years of age). Patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and had Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores \u226570 or Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores \u226520. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups to receive 6 weeks of cariprazine treatment through slow titration to 1.5, 3, or 4.5\u2009mg/d or fast titration to 4.5\u2009mg/d. Pharmacokinetics, adverse events (AEs), and various safety parameters were analyzed. Efficacy was evaluated as an exploratory outcome. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 50 participants were enrolled. Based on mean trough levels, steady state appeared to be reached within 1-2 weeks for cariprazine and DCAR and within 4-5 weeks for DDCAR. Systemic exposure of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR generally increased approximately in proportion to the increases in dose from 1.5 to 4.5\u2009mg/d. The most frequent treatment-related, treatment-emergent AEs included sedation, parkinsonism, tremor, dystonia, and blurred vision. Improvements from baseline on the PANSS and YMRS were observed throughout treatment. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In this first investigation of cariprazine in a pediatric population with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with those observed in adults. Cariprazine appeared to be safe and tolerable in children and adolescents.",

Detecting microRNA regulations as epigenetic actors in BD-I is important to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and reveal the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers. We evaluated the expression profile of six candidate miRNAs (hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-376a-3p, hsa-miR-3680-5p, hsa-miR-4253-5p, hsa-miR-4482-3p, and hsa-miR-4725) in patients with BD-I and in healthy controls (aged 11-50 years). We also determined the potential target genes of these miRNAs through in silico analysis. The diagnostic values of the miRNAs were calculated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Four miRNAs were upregulated (hsa-miR-376a-3p, hsa-miR-3680-5p, hsa-miR-4253-5p, hsa-miR-4482-3p) and hsa-miR-145-5p was downregulated in patients (p < 0.001). The target gene analyses showed that hsa-miR-145-5p specifically targets the dopamine decarboxylase (DDC) gene. The area under the curve of hsa-miR-145-5p was 0.987. Differential expression of five miRNAs in peripheral blood may be associated with the pathogenesis of BD-I, and hsa-miR-145-5p has potential as a BD-I biomarker. This miRNA can be used in dopamine-serotonin regulation and dose adjustment in drug therapy via the DDC gene.",

        "abstract": "The pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) remains largely unknown despite it causing significant disability and suicide risk. Serotonin signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Treatment of the depressed phase of the disorder is limited. Previous studies have indicated that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR) may predict antidepressant response. A total of 20 participants with BD in a current major depressive episode and 16 healthy volunteers had PET imaging with [11C]CUMI-101, employing a metabolite-corrected input function for quantification of binding potential to the 5HT1AR. Bipolar participants then received an open-labeled, 6-week clinical trial with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in addition to their mood stabilizer. Clinical ratings were obtained at baseline and during SSRI treatment. Pretreatment binding potential (BPF) of [11C]CUMI-101 was associated with a number of pretreatment clinical variables within BD participants. Within the raphe nucleus, it was inversely associated with the baseline Montgomery \u00c5sberg Rating Scale (P\u2009=\u2009.026), the Beck Depression Inventory score (P\u2009=\u2009.0023), and the Buss Durkee Hostility Index (P\u2009=\u2009.0058), a measure of lifetime aggression. A secondary analysis found [11C]CUMI-101 BPF was higher in bipolar participants compared with healthy volunteers (P\u2009=\u2009.00275). [11C]CUMI-101 BPF did not differ between SSRI responders and non-responders (P\u2009=\u2009.907) to treatment and did not predict antidepressant response (P\u2009=\u2009.580). Voxel-wise analyses confirmed the results obtained in regions of interest analyses. A disturbance of serotonin system function is associated with both the diagnosis of BD and its severity of depression. Pretreatment 5HT1AR binding did not predict SSRI antidepressant outcome.The study was listed on clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT02473250.",

        "abstract": "Although many antidepressants are available, they are not always used appropriately. For appropriate use of antidepressants, the old concept of a linear dose-response relationship, in which the dose is linearly increased to achieve a sufficient antidepressant effect, should be reconsidered. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate on the safe and appropriate use of antidepressants in patients with bipolar depression. Antidepressants may be used under certain conditions in patients with bipolar depression. These neglected-but not negligible-aspects of antidepressants have been discussed herein. A narrative qualitative review RESULTS: Dose-response relationships of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not linear. They may be bell-shaped, with efficacy initially increasing with an increase in dose but decreasing when the dose is increased beyond a certain point. Despite using international diagnostic criteria, uncertainty remains on whether operationally diagnosed depression is latent bipolar I depression, latent bipolar II depression, or true depression. Furthermore, operationally diagnosed bipolar II depression may be latent bipolar I depression, true bipolar II depression, or depression with false hypomanic episodes. Manic/hypomanic switches are most likely to occur in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants, followed by those receiving serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and SSRIs, in that order. Also, these switches are most likely to occur in patients with bipolar I depression, followed by those with bipolar II depression and true depression, in that order. Considering the diagnostic subtype of bipolar depression and antidepressant properties may help to determine the optimal treatment strategy.",

However, the relationship between LDAEP and individual serotonin receptors and transporters has not been fully explored in humans and may involve other neurotransmitter systems. To examine LDAEP's relationship with the serotonin system, we performed PET using serotonin-1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) imaging via [<sup>11</sup>C]CUMI-101 and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) imaging via [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB on a mixed sample of healthy controls (n\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b4: 4 females, 0 males), patients with unipolar (MDD, n\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b11: 4 females, 7 males) and bipolar depression (BD, n\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b8: 4 females, 4 males). On these same participants, we also performed electroencephalography (EEG) within a week of PET scanning, using 1000\u00a0\u200bHz tones of varying intensity to evoke LDAEP. We then evaluated the relationship between LDAEP and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> or 5-HTT binding in both the raphe (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>)/midbrain (5-HTT) areas and in the temporal cortex. We found that LDAEP was significantly correlated with 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> positively and with 5-HTT negatively in the temporal cortex (p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05), but not correlated with either in midbrain or raphe. In males only, exploratory analysis showed multiple regions in which LDAEP significantly correlated with 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> throughout the brain; we did not find this with 5-HTT. This multimodal study partially validates preclinical models of a serotonergic influence on LDAEP. Replication in larger samples is necessary to further clarify our understanding of the role of serotonin in perception of auditory tones.",

        "abstract": "Lithium, one of the few effective treatments for bipolar depression (BPD), has been hypothesized to work by enhancing serotonergic transmission. Despite preclinical evidence, it is unknown whether lithium acts via the serotonergic system. Here we examined the potential of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) pre-treatment binding to predict lithium treatment response and remission. We hypothesized that lower pre-treatment 5-HTT and higher pre-treatment 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding would predict better clinical response. Additional analyses investigated group differences between BPD and healthy controls and the relationship between change in binding pre- to post-treatment and clinical response. Twenty-seven medication-free patients with BPD currently in a depressive episode received positron emission tomography (PET) scans using 5-HTT tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB, a subset also received a PET scan using 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]-CUMI-101 before and after 8\u00a0weeks of lithium monotherapy. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were used to estimate binding potential, proportional to receptor availability. Fourteen patients with BPD with both [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB and [<sup>11</sup>C]-CUMI-101 pre-treatment scans and 8\u00a0weeks of post-treatment clinical scores were included in the prediction analysis examining the potential of either pre-treatment 5-HTT or 5-HT1A or the combination of both to predict post-treatment clinical scores. We found lower pre-treatment 5-HTT binding (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and lower 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding (p\u2009=\u20090.035) were both significantly associated with improved clinical response. Pre-treatment 5-HTT predicted remission with 71% accuracy (77% specificity, 60% sensitivity), while 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding was able to predict remission with 85% accuracy (87% sensitivity, 80% specificity). The combined prediction analysis using both 5-HTT and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> was able to predict remission with 84.6% accuracy (87.5% specificity, 60% sensitivity). Additional analyses BPD and controls pre- or post-treatment, and the change in binding were not significant and unrelated to treatment response (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Our findings suggest that while lithium may not act directly via 5-HTT or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> to ameliorate depressive symptoms, pre-treatment binding may be a potential biomarker for successful treatment of BPD with lithium.

        "title": "The fetal origins of mental illness.",
        "abstract": "The impact of infections and inflammation during pregnancy on the developing fetal brain remains incompletely defined, with important clinical and research gaps. Although the classic infectious TORCH pathogens (ie, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes simplex virus) are known to be directly teratogenic, emerging evidence suggests that these infections represent the most extreme end of a much larger spectrum of injury. We present the accumulating evidence that prenatal exposure to a wide variety of viral and bacterial infections-or simply inflammation-may subtly alter fetal brain development, leading to neuropsychiatric consequences for the child later in life. The link between influenza infections in pregnant women and an increased risk for development of schizophrenia in their children was first described more than 30 years ago. Since then, evidence suggests that a range of infections during pregnancy may also increase risk for autism spectrum disorder and depression in the child. Subsequent studies in animal models demonstrated that both pregnancy infections and inflammation can result in direct injury to neurons and neural progenitor cells or indirect injury through activation of microglia and astrocytes, which can trigger cytokine production and oxidative stress. Infectious exposures can also alter placental serotonin production, which can perturb neurotransmitter signaling in the developing brain. Clinically, detection of these subtle injuries to the fetal brain is difficult. As the neuropsychiatric impact of perinatal infections or inflammation may not be known for decades after birth, our construct for defining teratogenic infections in pregnancy (eg, TORCH) based on congenital anomalies is insufficient to capture the full adverse impact on the child. We discuss the clinical implications of this body of evidence and how we might place greater emphasis on prevention of prenatal infections. For example, increasing uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine is a key strategy to reduce perinatal infections and the risk for fetal brain injury. An important research gap exists in understanding how antibiotic therapy during pregnancy affects the fetal inflammatory load and how to avoid inflammation-mediated injury to the fetal brain. In summary, we discuss the current evidence and mechanisms linking infections and inflammation with the increased lifelong risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in the child, and how we might improve prenatal care to protect the fetal brain.",

        "abstract": "Manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder (BD) show opposite psychomotor symptoms. Neuronally, these may depend on altered relationships between sensorimotor network (SMN) and subcortical structures. The study aimed to investigate the functional relationships of SMN with substantia nigra (SN) and raphe nuclei (RN) via subcortical-cortical loops, and their alteration in bipolar mania and depression, as characterized by psychomotor excitation and inhibition. In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on healthy (n = 67) and BD patients (n = 100), (1) functional connectivity (FC) between thalamus and SMN was calculated and correlated with FC from SN or RN to basal ganglia (BG)/thalamus in healthy; (2) using an a-priori-driven approach, thalamus-SMN FC, SN-BG/thalamus FC, and RN-BG/thalamus FC were compared between healthy and BD, focusing on manic (n = 34) and inhibited depressed (n = 21) patients. (1) In healthy, the thalamus-SMN FC showed a quadratic correlation with SN-BG/thalamus FC and a linear negative correlation with RN-BG/thalamus FC. Accordingly, the SN-related FC appears to enable the thalamus-SMN coupling, while the RN-related FC affects it favoring anti-correlation. (2) In BD, mania showed an increase in thalamus-SMN FC toward positive values (ie, thalamus-SMN abnormal coupling) paralleled by reduction of RN-BG/thalamus FC. By contrast, inhibited depression showed a decrease in thalamus-SMN FC toward around-zero values (ie, thalamus-SMN disconnection) paralleled by reduction of SN-BG/thalamus FC (and RN-BG/thalamus FC). The results were replicated in independent HC and BD datasets. These findings suggest an abnormal relationship of SMN with neurotransmitters-related areas via subcortical-cortical loops in mania and inhibited depression, finally resulting in psychomotor alterations.",

        "abstract": "Alterations in brain intrinsic activity-as organized in resting-state networks (RSNs) such as sensorimotor network (SMN), salience network (SN), and default-mode network (DMN)-and in neurotransmitters signaling-such as dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT)-have been independently detected in psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between such neurotransmitters and RSNs in healthy, by reviewing the relevant work on this topic and performing complementary analyses, in order to better understand their physiological link, as well as their alterations in psychiatric disorders. According to the reviewed data, neurotransmitters nuclei diffusively project to subcortical and cortical regions of RSNs. In particular, the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SNc)-related nigrostriatal pathway is structurally and functionally connected with core regions of the SMN, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related mesocorticolimbic pathway with core regions of the SN. The serotonergic raphe nuclei (RNi) connections involve regions of the SMN and DMN. Coherently, changes in neurotransmitters activity impact the functional configuration and level of activity of RSNs, as measured by functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/temporal variability of BOLD signal. Specifically, DA signaling is associated with increase in FC and activity in the SMN (hypothetically via the SNc-related nigrostriatal pathway) and SN (hypothetically via the VTA-related mesocorticolimbic pathway), as well as concurrent decrease in FC and activity in the DMN. By contrast, 5-HT signaling (via the RNi-related pathways) is associated with decrease in SMN activity along with increase in DMN activity. Complementally, our empirical data showed a positive correlation between SNc-related FC and SMN activity, whereas a negative correlation between RNi-related FC and SMN activity (along with tilting of networks balance toward the DMN). According to these data, we hypothesize that the activity of neurotransmitter-related neurons synchronize the low-frequency oscillations within different RSNs regions, thus affecting the baseline level of RSNs activity and their balancing. In our model, DA signaling favors the predominance of SMN-SN activity, whereas 5-HT signaling favors the predominance of DMN activity, manifesting in distinct behavioral patterns. In turn, alterations in neurotransmitters signaling (or its disconnection) may favor a correspondent functional reorganization of RSNs, manifesting in distinct psychopathological states. The here suggested model carries important implications for psychiatric disorders, providing novel and well testable hypotheses especially on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal hippocampal neural plasticity has been implicated in behavioural abnormalities and complex neuropsychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD). However, the determinants of this neural alteration remain unknown. This work tests the hypothesis that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is a key determinant of hippocampal neuroplasticity, and its absence leads to maladaptive behaviour relevant for BD. Depletion of brain 5-HT in Tph2 mutant mice resulted in reduced behavioural despair, reduced anxiety, marked aggression and lower habituation in novel environments, reminiscent of bipolar-associated manic behaviour. Treatment with valproate produced a substantial improvement of the mania-like behavioural phenotypes displayed by Tph2 mutants. Brain-wide fMRI mapping in mutants revealed functional hippocampal hyperactivity in which we also observed dramatically increased neuroplasticity. Importantly, remarkable correspondence between the transcriptomic profile of the Tph2 mutant hippocampus and neurons from bipolar disorder patients was observed. Chronic stress reversed the emotional phenotype and the hippocampal transcriptional landscape of Tph2 mutants. These changes were associated with inappropriate activation of transcriptional adaptive response to stress as assessed by gene set enrichment analyses in the hippocampus of Tph2 mutant mice. These findings delineate 5-HT as a critical determinant in BD associated maladaptive emotional responses and aberrant hippocampal neuroplasticity, and support the use of Tph2-/- mice as a new research tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in bipolar disorder.",

Quantitative determinations of DA, 5-HT, NE and GABA concentrations in four distinct brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and pons) were determined by the spectrofluorimetric method. These experiments showed higher locomotion and increased swimming, struggling/climbing and decreased mobility among REMSD animals as well as disrupted concentrations of the majority of the studied neurotransmitters during REMSD.

Twenty-one symptomatic BD participants and 28 healthy controls (HC) were recruited and followed during usual clinical care.

In this mini-review, we broadly discuss evidence linking altered serotonergic neurotransmission in MDD and BD and focus on recently published methods for generating human serotonergic neurons in vitro.",

        "title": "Genetic association analysis of serotonin and signal transduction pathways in suicide attempters from an Italian sample of psychiatric patients.",
        "abstract": "Genetic factors have been reported to contribute to the liability of suicide. We aimed to investigate functional polymorphisms in eight genes (serotonin transporter, SLC6A4; receptors, 5HTR1A, 1B, 5HTR2A; Tryptophan Hydroxylase, TPH1, TPH2; Monoamine Oxidase, MAOA and G Protein Subunit Beta 3, GNB3) to investigate their predictive value for suicide. The possible confounding effects of gender and phenotypic patients dissection were also valued. A sample of 111 consecutive psychiatric inpatients was recruited and assessed using specific psychometric instruments. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral white blood cell samples and polymorphisms were genotyped by pyrosequencing technology. Although no differences were observed between allele and genotype frequencies for all polymorphisms and suicide attempt (SA), a polygenic risk score was detected for three genes HTR2A (A-1438G), TPH1 and TPH2 increasing the prediction of SA risk (Thresh=0.43, p=0.038, R<sup>2</sup>=0.053). Moreover some nominal associations were obtained after gender and phenotypic dissection stratification (TEMPS-A, TEMPs-H, GSMD, SHSS, GAF, CGI) for SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR), HTR1A (C-1019G), HTR2A (A-1438G), TPH1 (A799C) and GNB3 (C825T) genes, that were lost after Bonferroni correction. This is a first evidence that specific additive combinations of genes could increase the prediction of SA risk and that gender and phenotypic dissection could influence the association of the genes with SA. This could represent a further study also for future meta-analyses on larger samples.",

        "abstract": "A variety of alterations in brain neurotransmitter systems has been proposed as the cause of bipolar disorder (BD). We conducted a PUBMED search, which provided a total of 45 in vivo investigations with PET and SPECT, in which binding to serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (R), 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R, dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), D<sub>1</sub>R, D<sub>2</sub>R, muscarinic M2R and nicotinic \u00df2-nAChR as well as dopamine synthesis and/or dopamine release were assessed in BD patients in the manic (6 studies, 39 patients, 77 controls), depressive (15 studies, 248 patients, 488 controls) or eu- thymic condition (18 studies, 265 patients, 293 controls) and in mixed collectives of BD patients (6 studies, 55 patients, 80 controls). The retrospective analysis revealed a complex pattern of dysregulations within and between neurotransmitter systems, which is causally linked to the acute and euthymic states of BD. While increased mesencephalic, limbic and parietotemporoccipital serotonin and increased frontal dopamine underlie mania, the depressive state is characterized by decreased frontal and limbic serotonin, increased frontal and limbic acetylcholine and increased frontal dopamine. Also in euthymia, no normalization of receptor and transporter densities was observed. Alterations of regulation states of bindings sites, however, act together to achieve a normalization of mesencephalic, limbic and cortical serotonin.",

        "title": "Kynurenine pathway and white matter microstructure in bipolar disorder.",
        "abstract": "Decreased availability of serotonin in the central nervous system has been suggested to be a central factor in the pathogenesis of depression. Activation of indoleamine 2-3 dioxygenase following a pro-inflammatory state could reduce the amount of tryptophan converted to serotonin and increase the production of tryptophan catabolites such as kynurenic acid, an antagonist of ionotropic excitatory aminoacid receptors, whose levels are reduced in bipolar disorder. Abnormalities in white matter (WM) integrity have been widely reported in BD. We then hypothesized that metabolites involved in serotoninergic turnover in BD could influence DTI measures of WM microstructure. Peripheral levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine, and 5-HIAA were analysed in 22 patients affected by BD and 15 healthy controls. WM microstructure was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics with threshold-free cluster enhancement only in bipolar patients. We observed that kynurenic acid and 5-HIAA were reduced in BD and associated with DTI measures of WM integrity in several association fibres: inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle, corpus callosum, uncus, anterior thalamic radiation and corona radiata. Our results seem to suggest that higher levels of 5-HIAA, a measure of serotonin levels, and higher levels of kynurenic acid, which protects from glutamate excitotoxicity, could exert a protective effect on WM microstructure. Reduced levels of these metabolites in BD thus seem to confirm a crucial role of serotonin turnover in BD pathophysiology.",

        "title": "Integrated theory to unify status among schizophrenia and manic depressive illness.",
        "abstract": "Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and has been associated with both schizophrenia and depression. Although decreased serotonin activity has been reported in both depression and mania, it is important to investigate the interaction between serotonin and other neurotransmitter systems. There are competitive relationships between branched-chain amino acids, and tryptophan and tyrosine that relate to physical activity, and between L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), both highly dependent on intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations. Here, I propose a chaos theory for schizophrenia, mania, and depression using the competitive interaction between tryptophan and tyrosine with regard to the blood-brain barrier and coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin. Mania may be due to the initial conditions of physical hyperactivity and hypofunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing increased dopamine. Depression may be due to the initial conditions of physical hypoactivity and hypofunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing decreased serotonin. Psychomotor excitation may be due to the initial conditions of physical hyperactivity and hyperfunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing increased serotonin and substantially increased dopamine. The hallucinatory-paranoid state may be due to the initial conditions of physical hypoactivity and hyperfunctional 5-HTP-producing cells inducing increased serotonin and dopamine.",

        "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) and cluster headache (CH) are distinct conditions with important similarities such as a temporal pattern of disturbances, dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle, and response to lithium treatment in a proportion of patients. Aiming to identify common transcription signatures in these two disorders, we carried out an exploratory microarray gene expression analysis in lymphoblasts from 8 CH and 10 BD I patients selected for positive response to lithium and 10 healthy controls (CO). Gene expression levels of BD and CH were compared with CO to create two lists of differentially expressed genes. We then matched the two lists and focus on genes showing statistically significant difference and same change direction in both disorders. RNA binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) was the most significantly altered gene in the list (3.17\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-13) in BD, 9.44\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-14) in CH). Pathway analysis identified protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum as the most significantly enriched. For validation with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using the same samples, we selected seven genes. Among these, we were able to validate the RBM3, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1), and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1). These genes encode for elements involved in circadian rhythm regulation (RBM3 and NR1D1) and in serotonin synthesis (TPH1), processes previously involved in both disorders, and in the mechanism of action of lithium.",

        "title": "Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action, part 2: relevance for ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior.",
        "abstract": "Serotonin regulates a wide variety of brain functions and behaviors. Here, we synthesize previous findings that serotonin regulates executive function, sensory gating, and social behavior and that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior all share in common defects in these functions. It has remained unclear why supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D improve cognitive function and behavior in these brain disorders. Here, we propose mechanisms by which serotonin synthesis, release, and function in the brain are modulated by vitamin D and the 2 marine omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which is transcriptionally activated by vitamin D hormone. Inadequate levels of vitamin D (\u223c70% of the population) and omega-3 fatty acids are common, suggesting that brain serotonin synthesis is not optimal. We propose mechanisms by which EPA increases serotonin release from presynaptic neurons by reducing E2 series prostaglandins and DHA influences serotonin receptor action by increasing cell membrane fluidity in postsynaptic neurons. We propose a model whereby insufficient levels of vitamin D, EPA, or DHA, in combination with genetic factors and at key periods during development, would lead to dysfunctional serotonin activation and function and may be one underlying mechanism that contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and depression. This model suggests that optimizing vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake may help prevent and modulate the severity of brain dysfunction.",

        "title": "Adolescent angst or true intent? Suicidal behavior, risk, and neurobiological mechanisms in depressed children and teenagers taking antidepressants.",
        "abstract": "Suicide is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality amongst children and adolescents. In 2004 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a \"black-box\" warning for antidepressants in children and adolescents, stating that these drugs may increase suicidality, a term encompassing both suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in the first few weeks of treatment. The warning was extended in 2007 to antidepressants prescribed to adults aged 25 and under. The evidence behind this decision stemmed from meta-analyses of antidepressant clinical trials that demonstrated a slight increase in suicidality in those receiving antidepressants versus those treated with a placebo. Due to methods of this pooled data compilation, the relationship between antidepressants and suicidality remains controversial. This report investigates a case where a 14 year old with major depressive disorder (MDD) developed suicidal ideation shortly after being prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Investigating the role antidepressants may play in suicidality suggests the need to explore the neurobiological mechanisms within the serotonin system. This case and its theoretical explanations attempt to bridge the gap between neurobiology and pharmacology in order to better delineate the etiology of this adverse effect.",
