        "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the anterior limb of the internal capsule may be an area of convergence for multiple compulsion loops. In this study, the role of different dopaminergic compulsion loops in the mechanism of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was investigated by selectively damaging dopaminergic neurons or fibers in the corresponding targets with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and depicting the anatomical map of various compulsion loops located in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. A total of 52 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to either saline (1 mL/kg, NS group, n = 6) or quinpirole (QNP, dopamine D2-agonist, 0.5 mg/kg, n = 46) twice weekly for 5 weeks. After each injection, the rats were placed on an open field to analyze aspects of their behaviour, including the number of home base visits (NOH), average time between each home base visit (ATBO), and total distance travelled (TDM). After model setup, 46 QNP rats were divided randomly into five groups: 6-OHDA anterior limb of internal capsule (AC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+AC group, n = 10), 6-OHDA mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) stereotactic injection group (QNP+MD group, n = 10), 6-OHDA nucleus accumbens (NAC) stereotactic injection group (QNP+NAC group, n = 10), saline stereotactic injection group (QNP+NS-S group, n = 10), and non-surgical group (QNP+Non-S group, n = 6). In the NS group, rats simultaneously received a 6-OHDA stereotactic injection (NS+6-OHDA-S group, n = 6: AC2, MD2, NAC2). All QNP-treated rats were then continued to be given QNP twice a week for 4 weeks, and their behaviour was observed after each infusion. After 4 weeks, immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the distribution of dopamine neurons and nerve fibers in different areas of the intervention nerve loops, and quantitative analysis was performed. Compulsive behaviour declined gradually in the QNP+AC and QNP+NAC groups 3 and 4 weeks after surgery, with the QNP+AC group decreasing more rapidly. The QNP+MD group had decreased by 3 weeks after surgery but increased to almost the same level as pre-surgery at 4 weeks post-surgery. Postoperative fluorescence staining and quantitative analysis suggested the number of dopamine (DA) neurons or nerve fibers in the corresponding target area of the 6-OHDA injection were significantly reduced compared with the QNP+Non-S group. 6-OHDA selectively damages the targets of dopaminergic neurons or nerve fibers within the OCD loop, which somewhat alleviates compulsive behaviours. The results suggest that the AC might be the best target for therapeutic interventions for OCD.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) regulates working memory within the prefrontal cortex network, which is crucial for understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the mechanisms how network dynamics and serotonin interact in obsessive-compulsive disorder remain elusive. Here, we incorporate 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and dopamine receptors into a multistable prefrontal cortex network model, replicating the experimentally observed inverted U-curve phenomenon. We show how the two 5-HT receptors antagonize neuronal activity and modulate network multistability. Reduced binding of 5-HT1A receptors increases global firing, while reduced binding of 5-HT2A receptors deepens attractors. The obtained results suggest reward-dependent synaptic plasticity mechanisms may attenuate 5-HT related network impairments. Integrating serotonin-mediated dopamine release into circuit, we observe that decreased serotonin concentration triggers the network into a deep attractor state, expanding the domain of attraction of stable nodes with high firing rate, potentially causing aberrant reverse learning. This suggests a hypothesis wherein elevated dopamine concentrations in obsessive-compulsive disorder might result from primary deficits in serotonin levels. Findings of this work underscore the pivotal role of serotonergic dysregulation in modulating synaptic plasticity through dopamine pathways, potentially contributing to learned obsessions. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antidopaminergic potentiators can counteract the over-stable state of high-firing stable points, providing new insights into obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing psychiatric condition, which often onsets in childhood. Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N\u2009=\u2009135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n\u2009=\u200964 had an OCD diagnosis. N\u2009=\u200947 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.51) and ventral tegmental area (p\u2009=\u20090.006, d\u2009=\u20090.50).

Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20091.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response.",

        "abstract": "The neurobiological understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes dysregulated frontostriatal circuitry and altered monoamine transmission. Repetitive stereotyped behavior (e.g., grooming), a featured symptom in OCD, has been proposed to be associated with perturbed dopamine (DA) signaling. However, the precise brain circuits participating in DA's control over this behavioral phenotype remain elusive. Here, we identified that DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) orchestrate ventromedial striatum (VMS) microcircuits as well as lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) during self-grooming behavior. SNc-VMS and SNc-lOFC dopaminergic projections modulate grooming behaviors and striatal microcircuit function differentially. Specifically, the activity of the SNc-VMS pathway promotes grooming via D1 receptors, whereas the activity of the SNc-lOFC pathway suppresses grooming via D2 receptors. SNc DA neuron activity thus controls the OCD-like behaviors via both striatal and cortical projections as dual gating. These results support both pharmacological and brain-stimulation treatments for OCD.",

        "title": "Developmental impact of glutamate transporter overexpression on dopaminergic neuron activity and stereotypic behavior.",
        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition that often begins in childhood. Genetic studies in OCD have pointed to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, with evidence suggesting that increased expression contributes to risk. In mice, midbrain Slc1a1 expression supports repetitive behavior in response to dopaminergic agonists, aligning with neuroimaging and pharmacologic challenge studies that have implicated the dopaminergic system in OCD. These findings suggest that Slc1a1 may contribute to compulsive behavior through altered dopaminergic transmission; however, this theory has not been mechanistically tested. To examine the developmental impact of Slc1a1 overexpression on compulsive-like behaviors, we, therefore, generated a novel mouse model to perform targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in dopaminergic neurons. Mice with life-long overexpression of Slc1a1 showed a significant increase in amphetamine (AMPH)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that Slc1a1 overexpression was associated with increased firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dLight1.1 fiber photometry showed that these behavioral abnormalities were associated with increased dorsal striatum dopamine release. In contrast, no impact of overexpression was observed on anxiety-like behaviors or SKF-38393-induced grooming. Importantly, overexpression solely in adulthood failed to recapitulate these behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that overexpression during development is necessary to generate AMPH-induced phenotypes. However, doxycycline-induced reversal of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression in adulthood normalized both the increased dopaminergic firing and AMPH-induced responses. These data indicate that the pathologic effects of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression on dopaminergic neurotransmission and AMPH-induced stereotyped behavior are developmentally mediated, and support normalization of EAAT3 activity as a potential treatment target for basal ganglia-mediated repetitive behaviors.",

Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission have been shown to play an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Here we aim to assess the genetic contribution of these systems to eight psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (ANO), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and Tourette's syndrome (TS)) using publicly available GWAS analyses performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium that include more than 160,000 cases and 275,000 controls. To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic examination of genes encoding proteins essential to the function of these two neurotransmitter systems in these disorders. Our results support a pleiotropic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in several psychiatric conditions.",

        "abstract": "Dorsal striatal dopamine transmission engages the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, which is implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet it is unknown if dorsal striatal dopamine hyperactivity is the cause or consequence of changes elsewhere in the CSTC circuit. Classical pharmacological and neurotoxic manipulations of the CSTC and other brain circuits suffer from various drawbacks related to off-target effects and adaptive changes. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, enables a highly selective targeting of specific neuronal populations within a given circuit. In this study, we developed a chemogenetic method for selective activation of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, which innervates the dorsal striatum in the rat. We used this model to investigate effects of targeted dopamine activation on CSTC circuit function, especially in fronto-cortical regions. We found that chemogenetic activation of these neurons increased movement (as expected with increased dopamine release), rearings and time spent in center, while also lower self-grooming. Furthermore, this activation increased prepulse inhibition of the startle response in females. Remarkably, we observed reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism in the frontal cortex, following dopamine activation in the dorsal striatum, while total glutamate levels- in this region were increased. This result is in accord with clinical studies of increased [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG metabolism and lower glutamate levels in similar regions of the brain of people with OCD. Taken together, the present chemogenetic model adds a mechanistic basis with behavioral and translational relevance to prior clinical neuroimaging studies showing deficits in fronto-cortical glucose metabolism across a variety of clinical populations (e.g. addiction, risky decision-making, compulsivity or obesity).",

        "abstract": "Dopamine is essential to many functions like reward, motivation, and attention; when its neural pathways do not function properly, various disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, compulsions) can arise. Truncated-DAT rats display persistent stereotypies and aggressiveness; hence they are a new valuable animal model to study the pathogenesis of these disorders. The focus of research is often on the individual epigenetic determinants and much less on the impact of social experiences. Here, we investigate the developmental impact of the social environment on adolescent wild type (WT) rats. We divided subjects at weaning into three groups: living with another adolescent (WT Peer), with a WT adult, or with a truncated-DAT one, and we observed homecage social behavior of these pairs (play, jump, victory, and \"bullying\") during whole adolescence. When adult, we observed the same subjects in plus maze, forced swim, and social preference tests to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and quality of social interactions. Compared to the other groups, WT rats that had spent their adolescence with a truncated-DAT adult as companion show more anxious, depressive, hyperactive, impulsive, and compulsive behaviours. Results confirm that social interactions and healthy play (i.e., when play has behavioural, social, and psychomotor rewards that support the cognitive, emotional and physical development of the individual) are essential to neurobehavioral maturation. Conversely, anomalous interactions like poor play and \"bullying\" in developing rats may impact onto their dopaminergic system. Consequently, an impoverished social play could be one of the factors contributing to the appearance of putative indexes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and\\or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",

Neural mechanisms underlying these disturbances are unclear; however, striatal dopamine is implicated in regulation of sensorimotor gating and OCD pathophysiology. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between sensorimotor gating, compulsive behavior, and striatal dopamine receptor levels in Sapap3 knockout mice (KOs), a widely used preclinical model system for OCD research. We found a trend for disruption of sensorimotor gating in Sapap3-KOs using the translational measure prepulse inhibition (PPI); however, there was significant heterogeneity in both PPI and compulsive grooming in KOs. Disruption of PPI was significantly correlated with a more severe compulsive phenotype. In addition, PPI disruption and compulsive grooming severity were associated with reduced dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC). Compulsive grooming progressively worsened in Sapap3-KOs tested longitudinally, but PPI disruption was first detected in high-grooming KOs at 7\u00a0months of age. Through detailed characterization of individual differences in OCD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical measures, our findings suggest that NAcC dopamine receptor changes may be involved in disruption of sensorimotor gating and compulsive behavior relevant to OCD.",

Specialty psychotherapy is also used as both first-line and second-line treatment and can benefit many. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond to these treatments. New alternatives are urgently needed. This review summarizes evidence for these established pharmacotherapeutic strategies, and for others that have been investigated in refractory disease but are not supported by the same level of evidence. We focus on three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. We summarize evidence from genetic, neuroimaging, animal model, and other lines of investigation that probe these three systems in patients with OCD. We also review recent work on predictors of response to current treatments. While many studies suggest abnormalities that may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, most studies have been small, and non-replication of reported findings has been common. Nevertheless, the gradual accrual of evidence for neurotransmitter dysregulation may in time lead the way to new pharmacological strategies.",

        "abstract": "Checking is a functional behaviour that provides information to guide behaviour. However, in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), checking may escalate to dysfunctional levels. The processes underpinning the transition from functional to dysfunctional checking are unclear but may be associated with individual differences that support the development of maladaptive behaviour. We examined one such predisposition, sign-tracking to a pavlovian conditioned stimulus, which we previously found associated with dysfunctional checking. How sign-tracking interacts with another treatment with emerging translational validity for OCD-like checking, chronic administration of the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist quinpirole, is unknown. We tested how functional and dysfunctional checking in the rat observing response task (ORT) was affected by chronic quinpirole administration in non-autoshaped controls and autoshaped animals classified as sign-trackers or goal-trackers. Sign-trackers or goal-trackers were trained on the ORT before the effects of chronic quinpirole administration on checking were assessed. Subsequently, the effects on checking of different behavioural challenges, including reward omission and the use of unpredictable reinforcement schedules, were tested. Prior autoshaping increased checking. Sign-trackers and goal-trackers responded differently to quinpirole sensitization, reward omission and reinforcement uncertainty. Sign-trackers showed greater elevations in dysfunctional checking, particularly during uncertainty. By contrast, goal-trackers predominantly increased functional checking responses, possibly in response to reduced discrimination accuracy in the absence of cues signalling which lever was currently active. The results are discussed in terms of how pavlovian associations influence behaviour that becomes compulsive in OCD and how this may be dependent on striatal dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors.",

Considerable evidence has linked prediction error processing to dopaminergic function. In this study, we investigate potential dopaminergic dysfunction during reward processing in the context of OCD. We studied OCD patients (n\u2009=\u200918) and controls (n\u2009=\u200918) whilst they learned probabilistic associations between abstract stimuli and monetary rewards in the fMRI scanner involving administration (on separate visits) of a dopamine receptor agonist, pramipexole 0.5\u00a0mg; a dopamine receptor antagonist, amisulpride 400\u00a0mg; and placebo. We fitted a Q-learning computational model to fMRI prediction error responses; group differences were examined in anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens regions of interest. There were no significant group, drug, or interaction effects in the number of correct choices; computational modeling suggested a marginally significant difference in learning rates between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.089, partial \u019e<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.1). In the imaging results, there was a significant interaction of group by drug (p\u2009=\u20090.013, partial \u019e<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.13). OCD patients showed abnormally strong cingulate signaling of prediction errors during omission of an expected reward, with unexpected reduction by both pramipexole and amisulpride (p\u2009=\u20090.014, partial \u019e<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.26, 1-\u03b2 error probability =\u20090.94). Exaggerated cingulate prediction error signaling to omitted reward in placebo was related to trait subjective difficulty in self-regulating behavior in OCD. Our data support cingulate dysfunction during reward processing in OCD, and bidirectional remediation by dopaminergic modulation, suggesting that exaggerated cingulate error signals in OCD may be of dopaminergic origin. The results help to illuminate the mechanisms through which dopamine receptor antagonists achieve therapeutic benefit in OCD.

Repetitive stereotypes and routines can be caused by perseverative thoughts and motor sequences in both of these disorders. We extended a previously published computational model to investigate cortico-striatal network dynamics. Given the considerable overlap in symptom phenomenology and the high degree of co-morbidity between OCD and schizophrenia, we examined the dynamical consequences of functional connectivity variations in the overlapping network. This was achieved by focusing on the emergence of network oscillatory activity and examining parameter sensitivity. Opposing activity levels are present in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in schizophrenia and OCD. We found that with over-compensation of the primary pathology, emergence of the other disorder can occur. The oscillatory behavior is delicately modulated by connections between the OFC/ACC to the ventral and dorsal striatum and by the coupling between the ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Modulation on cortical self-inhibition (e.g. serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment) together with dopaminergic input to the striatum (e.g. anti-dopaminergic medication) has non-trivial complex effects on the network oscillatory behavior, with an optimal modulatory window. Additionally, there are several disruption mechanisms and compensatory processes in the cortico-striato-thalamic network which may contribute to the underlying neuropathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity in schizo-obsessive spectrum disorders. Our mechanistic model predicts that dynamic over-compensation of the primarily occuring neuropathophysiology can lead to the secondary co-morbid disease.",

Structural, neurochemical, and behavioral findings point to a significant role for basal ganglia circuits and for the glutamate system in OCD. Genetic linkage and association studies in OCD point to <i>SLC1A1</i>, which encodes the neuronal glutamate/aspartate/cysteine transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3)/excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAC1). However, no previous studies have investigated EAAT3 in basal ganglia circuits or in relation to OCD-related behavior. Here, we report a model of <i>Slc1a1</i> loss based on an excisable STOP cassette that yields successful ablation of EAAT3 expression and function. Using amphetamine as a probe, we found that EAAT3 loss prevents expected increases in (<i>i</i>) locomotor activity, (<i>ii</i>) stereotypy, and (<i>iii</i>) immediate early gene induction in the dorsal striatum following amphetamine administration. Further, <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice showed diminished grooming in an SKF-38393 challenge experiment, a pharmacologic model of OCD-like grooming behavior. This reduced grooming is accompanied by reduced dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor binding in the dorsal striatum of <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice. <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice also exhibit reduced extracellular dopamine concentrations in the dorsal striatum both at baseline and following amphetamine challenge. Viral-mediated restoration of <i>Slc1a1</i>/EAAT3 expression in the midbrain but not in the striatum results in partial rescue of amphetamine-induced locomotion and stereotypy in <i>Slc1a1</i>-STOP mice, consistent with an impact of EAAT3 loss on presynaptic dopaminergic function.

        "title": "Prazosin addition to fluvoxamine: A preclinical study and open clinical trial in OCD.",
        "abstract": "The efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in psychiatric disorders may be \"augmented\" through the addition of atypical antipsychotic drugs. A synergistic increase in dopamine (DA) release in the prefrontal cortex has been suggested to underlie this augmentation effect, though the mechanism of action is not clear yet. We used in vivo microdialysis in rats to study DA release following the administration of combinations of fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg) and quetiapine (10 mg/kg) with various monoamine-related drugs. The results confirmed that the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (0.05 mg/kg) partially blocked the fluvoxamine-quetiapine synergistic effect (maximum DA increase dropped from 325% to 214%). A novel finding is that the \u03b11-adrenergic blocker prazosin (1 mg/kg), combined with fluvoxamine, partially mimicked the effect of augmentation (maximum DA increase 205%; area-under-the-curve 163%). As this suggested that prazosin augmentation might be tested in a clinical study, we performed an open clinical trial of prazosin 20 mg addition to SRI in therapy-resistant patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder applying for neurosurgery. A small, non-significant reduction in Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores was observed in 10 patients and one patient was classified as a responder with a reduction in Y-BOCS scores of more than 25%. We suggest that future clinical studies augmenting SRIs with an \u03b11-adrenergic blocker in less treatment resistant cases should be considered. The clinical trial \"Prazosin in combination with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for patients with Obsessive Compulsive disorder: an open label study\" was registered at 24/05/2011 under trial number ISRCTN61562706: http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN61562706.",

        "title": "Symmetry symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder: clinical and genetic correlates.",
        "abstract": "In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), symmetry-related symptoms may be important. Although clinical correlates of symmetry-related symptoms have been identified in OCD, few data exist on genetic associations. Animal studies indicate involvement of dopamine in symmetry-related behavior, suggesting this may be relevant to analogous symptoms in OCD. Alterations in dopamine may also reflect environmental influences. However, the association of symmetry-related symptomatology, early adversity, and polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes has not been investigated in OCD. Clinical information and polymorphisms in key dopaminergic genes were compared between OCD patients with primary symmetry symptoms and those without. OCD patients with primary symmetry symptoms comprised 46.6% (n=210) of the sample (n=451), and were older (p < 0.01), had longer illness duration (p < 0.01), higher OCD severity scores (p = 0.01), and greater comorbidity (p < 0.01) than those without. In Caucasians (n=343), genotype frequency differed significantly between groups for ANKK1 rs1800497, with more OCD patients with symmetry symptoms being homozygous for the A2 (CC) genotype (\u03c72 = 7.296; p = 0.026). Symmetry symptoms have some distinct clinical features and may represent a marker of severity in OCD. However, clinical associations, in combination with the association found with the ANKK1 rs1800497 A2 variant, suggest that primary symmetry symptoms may represent a distinctive clinical and psychobiological profile.",

        "abstract": "Stereotypies that develop spontaneously in nonhuman primates can provide an effective model for repetitive stereotyped behavior in people with neurodevelopmental or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The behaviors are similar in form, are similarly affected by environmental conditions, and are improved with similar treatment methods such as enrichment, training, and drug therapy. However, because of a greater number of commonalities in these factors, nonhuman primates may serve as a better model for stereotyped behavior in individuals with autism or intellectual disability than for compulsions in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because animal models may not be exact in all features of the disorder being studied, it is important to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of using a nonhuman primate model for stereotyped behavior in people with psychological disorders.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive thoughts and behaviours that are experienced as unwanted. Family and twin studies have demonstrated that OCD is a multifactorial familial condition that involves both polygenic and environmental risk factors. Neuroimaging studies have implicated the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit in the pathophysiology of the disorder, which is supported by the observation of specific neuropsychological impairments in patients with OCD, mainly in executive functions. Genetic studies indicate that genes affecting the serotonergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, and the interaction between them, play a crucial part in the functioning of this circuit. Environmental factors such as adverse perinatal events, psychological trauma and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk genes and, hence, trigger the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive behaviours.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling neuropsychiatric disorder. Current treatment modalities, such as pharmacological and behavioral methods, are sometimes unsatisfactory. The mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway is supposed to have a role in the pathogenesis of OCD. In this study, L-3,4-Dihydroxy-6-[F-18]fluorophenylalanine (F-18 FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) is exploited to investigate the possible abnormality of dopaminergic neuronal circuits in the brains of OCD patients in vivo. The study subjects were recruited after psychological assessment and gave written informed consent to participate. The F-18 FDOPA PET scans were performed on five OCD patients and six healthy volunteers at 120\u2009min after 185 MBq of F-18 FDOPA intravenous injection. The PET results were analyzed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping tool. Compared to the healthy subjects, the OCD brains showed increased dopaminergic metabolism in the left frontal premotor cortex (P\u2009<\u20090.001), along with trends toward an increase in the left posterior cingulate gyrus, the left cuneus, the left lingual gyrus, the right cuneus and precuneus, the right lingual gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, the left cerebellum, and the right cerebellum (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Our observations suggest that the increased dopaminergic neuronal function in these brain areas may be implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic psychiatric disorder related to dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has recently become an effective treatment for therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, but its effect on dopaminergic transmission is unknown. We measured the effects of NAc DBS in 15 patients on the dopamine D2/3 receptor availability in the striatum with [(123)I]iodobenzamide ([(123)I]IBZM) single photon emission computed tomography. We correlated changes in [(123)I]IBZM binding potential (BP) with plasma levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and clinical symptoms. Acute (1-hour) and chronic (1-year) DBS decreased striatal [(123)I]IBZM BP compared with the nonstimulated condition in the putamen. BP decreases were observed after 1 hour of stimulation, and chronic stimulation was related to concurrent HVA plasma elevations, implying DBS-induced dopamine release. BP decreases in the area directly surrounding the electrodes were significantly correlated with changes in clinical symptoms (45% symptom decrease). NAc DBS induced striatal dopamine release, which was associated with increased HVA plasma levels and improved clinical symptoms, suggesting that DBS may compensate for a defective dopaminergic system.",
