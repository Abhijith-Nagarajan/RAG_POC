        "title": "Large nesting expression in deer mice remains stable under conditions of visual deprivation despite heightened limbic involvement: Perspectives on compulsive-like behavior.",
        "abstract": "Visual stimuli and limbic activation varyingly influence obsessive-compulsive symptom expression and so impact treatment outcomes. Some symptom phenotypes, for example, covert repugnant thoughts, are likely less sensitive to sensory stimuli compared to symptoms with an extrinsic focus, that is, symptoms related to contamination, safety, and \"just-right-perceptions.\" Toward an improved understanding of the neurocognitive underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive psychobiology, work in naturalistic animal model systems is useful. Here, we explored the impact of visual feedback and limbic processes on 24 normal (NNB) and large (LNB) nesting deer mice, respectively (as far as possible, equally distributed between sexes). Briefly, after behavioral classification into either the NNB or LNB cohorts, mice of each cohort were separated into two groups each and assessed for nesting expression under either standard light conditions or conditions of complete visual deprivation (VD). Nesting outcomes were assessed in terms of size and neatness. After nesting assessment completion, mice were euthanized, and samples of frontal-cortical and hippocampal tissues were collected to determine serotonin and noradrenaline concentrations. Our results show that LNB, as opposed to NNB, represents an inflexible and excessive behavioral phenotype that is not dependent on visually guided action-outcome processing, and that it associates with increased frontal-cortical and hippocampal noradrenaline concentrations, irrespective of lighting condition. Collectively, the current results are informing of the neurocognitive underpinnings of nesting behavior. It also provides a valuable foundation for continued investigations into the noradrenergic mechanisms that may influence the development and promulgation of excessive, rigid, and inflexible behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) are related mental disorders that share genetic, neurobiological, and phenomenological features. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a neuropsychiatric autoimmune disorder with symptoms of OCD and/or TS associated with streptococcal infections. Therefore, PANDAS represents a strong link between OCD, TS, and autoimmunity. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses can provide insight into the central nervous processes in OCD, TS, and PANDAS. A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA criteria was conducted to collect all CSF studies in patients with OCD, TS, and PANDAS. The total number of cases and the heterogeneity of the low number of studies were not sufficient for a meta-analysis to provide a high level of evidence. Nevertheless, meta-analytical statistics could be performed for glutamate, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (degradation product of serotonin), homovanillic acid (degradation product of dopamine), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (major metabolite of noradrenaline), and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in OCD. A risk-of-bias assessment was implemented using the Cochrane ROBINS-E tool. Meta-analytical testing identified elevated glutamate levels in the CSF of OCD patients compared with healthy controls, while no significant differences were found in other neurotransmitters or CRH. Single studies detected novel neuronal antibodies in OCD patients and elevated oligoclonal bands in TS patients. For TS and PANDAS groups, there was a dearth of data. Risk of bias assessment indicated a substantial risk of bias in most of the included studies. This systematic review of available CSF data shows that too few studies are currently available for conclusions with good evidence. The existing data indicates glutamate alterations in OCD and possible immunological abnormalities in OCD and TS. More CSF studies avoiding sources of bias are needed.",

Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (<i>n</i> = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13-83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00-75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96-27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68-7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive behaviors exacerbated by stress. Many OCD patients do not respond to available pharmacotherapies, but neurosurgical ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can provide symptomatic relief. Although the ACC receives noradrenergic innervation and expresses adrenergic receptors (ARs), the involvement of norepinephrine (NE) in OCD has not been investigated. To determine the effects of genetic or pharmacological disruption of NE neurotransmission on marble burying (MB) and nestlet shredding (NS),\u00a0two animal models of OCD. We assessed NE-deficient (Dbh -/-) mice and NE-competent (Dbh +/-) controls in MB and NS tasks. We also measured the effects of anti-adrenergic drugs on NS and MB in control mice and the effects of pharmacological restoration of central NE in Dbh -/- mice. Finally, we compared c-fos induction in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ACC of Dbh -/- and control mice following both tasks. Dbh -/- mice virtually lacked MB and NS behaviors seen in control mice but did not differ in the elevated zero maze (EZM) model of general anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological restoration of central NE synthesis in Dbh -/- mice completely rescued NS behavior, while NS and MB were suppressed in control mice by anti-adrenergic drugs. Expression of c-fos in the ACC was attenuated in Dbh -/- mice after MB and NS. These findings support a role for NE transmission to the ACC in the expression of stress-induced compulsive behaviors and suggest further evaluation of anti-adrenergic drugs for OCD is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are widespread psychiatric conditions with significant social and professional disability, poor quality of life, an increased risk of suicide, and frequent attendance of medical services. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) have demonstrated a rather robust efficacy for the treatment of most of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless a substantial number of patients are resistant or still suffer from residual symptoms despite this first line treatment. The objective of our paper is to review relevant studies for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders resistant to the first line treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a pubmed/medline search for double-blind placebo-controlled trials of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. An adequate trial for a SRI in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should continue for at least 12 weeks. Special considerations of the comorbidities and symptom profile could help in the choice of an appropriate pharmacotherapy. Several trials have highlighted the efficacy of antipsychotics as an add-on to SRI in treatment-resistant OCD such as haloperidol more so when comorbid with a tic disorder, or risperidone that can reduce OCD as well as depressive symptoms. Aripiprazole has been shown efficacious in two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, while the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine remains controversial. Other trials showed some efficacy of anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, topiramate), pindolol, memantin and N-acetylcystein as an adjunctive treatment to SRI for resistant OCD. Few trials have investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or SNRI resistant generalized anxiety disorder showing a failure of adjunctive therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and risperidone. These studies were underpowered and very limited in number. Adjunctive risperidone for resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed benefit in some but not all trials. Olanzapine was beneficial for the reduction of the CAPS score in addition to the improvement of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, prazosin was efficacious by reducing PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and psychological distress. One double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate treatment-resistant social phobia showing no benefit of pindolol add-on paroxetine. Our results demonstrate that the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders is not sufficiently investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, despite a growing evidence in favor of antipsychotics and some other pharmacological agents in resistant OCD and, to a lesser extent, PTSD. Hence, there is a crucial need for larger double-blind placebo-controlled trials for resistant anxiety disorders. Finally, being out of the scope of our review, we omitted studies of non-pharmacologic therapies.",

Since DBS may induce rapid symptomatic changes and the pathophysiology of OCD has been linked to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, we set out to study whether DBS affects the HPA axis in OCD patients. We compared a stimulation ON and OFF condition with a one-week interval in 16 therapy-refractory OCD patients, treated with DBS for at least one year, targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We measured changes in 24-h urinary excretion of free cortisol (UFC), adrenaline and noradrenaline and changes in obsessive-compulsive (Y-BOCS), depressive (HAM-D) and anxiety (HAM-A) symptom scores. Median UFC levels increased with 53% in the OFF condition (from 93 to 143nmol/24h, p=0.12). There were no changes in urinary adrenaline or noradrenaline excretion. The increase in Y-BOCS (39%), and HAM-D (78%) scores correlated strongly with increased UFC levels in the OFF condition. Our findings indicate that symptom changes following DBS for OCD patients are associated with changes in UFC levels.",

To bypass this obstacle, this study investigated neurobiological parameters during a standardized disgust provocation paradigm in patients with OCD and healthy controls. Ten OCD patients and 10 healthy controls were exposed to 9 disgust related items using a standardized provocation paradigm. Catecholamines and cortisol in plasma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by peripheral leucocytes were assessed along with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, disgust, and anxiety levels using Visual Analogue Scales prior, during and after a provocation paradigm. Noradrenalin levels increased, while LPS stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 by peripheral leucocytes decreased during exposure to disgust related objects in OCD patients but not in healthy controls. Cortisol levels were not affected by exposure neither in patients nor in controls, but overall cortisol levels of OCD patients were increased compared to controls. In conclusion, our data suggests that symptom provocation in OCD patients with contamination fear is accompanied by alterations in the immune and neuroendocrine systems but does not affect cortisol levels.",

The aim of this study was to relate psychiatric distress, as expressed by the scores in the SCL-90 subscales, to CSF levels of the main metabolites of noradrenaline (MHPG), serotonin (5-HIAA), and dopamine (HVA) in NPH patients. The metabolite levels were estimated in CSF samples taken during the tap test in 19 patients with probable NPH, and compared to 19 sex- and age-matched controls. Cognitive impairment was evaluated by the MMSE. Compared to controls, NPH patients had similar MHPG and 5-HIAA levels, and significantly elevated HVA levels, a notable difference from patients with dementias. There were no significant correlations of metabolite levels to the scores in the nine SCL-90 subscales. MMSE score was not related either to metabolite levels, or to the SCL-90 subscale scores. Patients scored higher than controls in most SCL-90 subscales, more pronounced being the difference in obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Serotonergic neurotransmitter activity seems not to be altered in NPH patients, and this may explain the reported lack of beneficial effect of serotonergic drugs for obsessive-compulsive symptoms in NPH patients.",

These drugs have in common important effects on the serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission system, which is involved in mediating a substantial number of important functions, including mood, aggression, sexual behavior, and pain. In addition, some of the new antidepressants, like venlafaxine/venlafaxine XR, also have effects on the noradrenergic neurotransmission system, which also appears important in mood and anxiety disorders. These new drugs, because of their specificity for the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake proteins, lack most of the adverse side effects of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Consequently, in addition to being the usual first-line treatments for major depression, they are also first-line for panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and bulimia. They may also be the best medication treatments for dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder.

Failure to control for the effects of both anxiety and novelty, which contribute to subjects' response to orthostatic challenge in control patients, could possibly account for this. The blood pressure, pulse, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine responses to orthostasis were examined in patients with panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (to control for nonspecific anxiety effects), and controls, on two separate days a week apart (to control for novelty). All measures showed robust and significant increases with orthostatic challenge that were generally similar across groups. Pressure responses were greater on average on the first compared with the second day and panic disorder patients had higher plasma norepinephrine levels throughout the study and a diminished diastolic blood pressure response on the first day. These findings in general support the absence of consistent peripheral autonomic nervous system differences in response to orthostatic challenge in panic disorder patients.",

Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained in a standardized fashion for measurement of CRF from 21 medication-free outpatients with TS, 20 with OCD, and 29 healthy controls. The TS patients had significantly higher levels of CSF CRF than both the normal controls and the OCD patients. However, there was no difference in CSF CRF between the OCD patients and the normal controls. Group differences in CSF CRF were unrelated to current clinical ratings of depression, anxiety, tics, and obsessive compulsive behaviors. Although the functional significance of this finding remains to be elucidated, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that stress-related neurobiological mechanisms may play a role in the pathobiology of TS.",

In fact, no psychiatric syndrome seems to worsen with these agents, and few studies fail to demonstrate clinical improvement in some patients, regardless of any nosologic nicety, such as precise DSM diagnosis. This suggests that the biological rubric of psychopathology is dimensional rather than categorical. New research using in vivo microdialysis shows differences in neurochemistry among SSRIs, wherein fluoxetine blocks reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as serotonin, in medial prefrontal cortex, and fluvoxamine has a relatively more selective neurochemical profile. In the animal model of learned helplessness, which is a biobehavioral model for stress-induced anxiety causing depression, the SSRIs including fluvoxamine prevent helplessness. From these and other data, a neurotransmitter balance theory of biopsychopathology is formulated. In this hypothetical construct, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA modulate thought, anxiety, and mood, respectively. Serotonin is a stabilizing agent, which assists in returning the mind to its homeostatic setpoint.",

The analysis of the biochemical abnormalities present in the patients with bulimia nervosa indicates the decrease of central serotonin and noradrenalin activity, elevation of the levels of cerebrospinal fluid peptide YY, alterations of the endogenous opioids and also reduction of peripheral cholecystokinin levels. As these studies were performed on patients who were actively binging and purging it is conceivable that the above abnormalities can results from a pathological feeding pattern. It is also suggested that the reduction of central serotoninergic activity is the stable, trait-related dysregulation of neurotransmitter system activity. In patients with anorexia nervosa the endocrine disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes were thoroughly studied. Underweight anorectic patients have been found to have elevations of cerebrospinal fluid level of neuropeptide Y, corticotropin releasing hormone and vasopressin as well as reductions of beta-endorphin and oxytocin level. However, most of the neuropeptide alterations normalize following weight recovery.
