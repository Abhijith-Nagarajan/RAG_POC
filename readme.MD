Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLaMAIndex and FAISS
This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The goal of this project is to leverage LLaMAIndex for indexing and FAISS for efficient vector search, enabling a powerful retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.

Motivation 
I wanted to work on a mental health chatbot because it allowed me to explore multiple areas of interest: AI, psychology, and neuroscience. The project aims to link neurotransmitters to mood disorders and correlate well-being with nutrition, exercise, and general lifestyle. Picking an interdisciplinary topic also presented me with a larger corpus to work with. Overall, I was keen to experiment with LLMs and build an application on a topic of my passion and interest. I continue to work on this because I am driven by curiosity and enjoy problem-solving.
