Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) POC with LLaMAIndex and FAISS
This repository contains a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. 
The goal of this project is to leverage LLaMAIndex for indexing and FAISS for efficient vector search, enabling a powerful retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.
